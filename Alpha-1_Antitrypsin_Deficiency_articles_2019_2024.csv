Liver Characterization of a Cohort of Alpha-1 Antitrypsin Deficiency Patients with and without Lung Disease.,"Alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency (AATD) is a genetic disorder characterized by the misfolding and accumulation of the mutant variant of alpha-1 antitrypsin (AAT) within hepatocytes, which limits its access to the circulation and exposes the lungs to protease-mediated tissue damage. This results in progressive liver disease secondary to AAT polymerization and accumulation, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) due to deficient levels of AAT within the lungs. Our goal was to characterize the unique effects of COPD secondary to AATD on liver disease and gene expression.","Naweed Mohammad, Regina Oshins, Tongjun Gu, Virginia Clark, Jorge Lascano, Naziheh Assarzadegan, George Marek, Mark Brantly, Nazli Khodayari",2024
"A High-Intensity versus Moderate-Intensity exercise training program in Alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency-related COPD (IMAC): a randomized, controlled trial.","Training-induced adaptations of the oxidative capacity have been shown to be blunted in alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency (AATD)-related chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). To improve training outcomes in AATD, this study was aimed to compare the effects of two exercise training programs with different training intensities.","Inga Jarosch, Tessa Schneeberger, Rainer Glöckl, Daniela Kroll, Clancy Dennis, Wolfgang Hitzl, Klaus Kenn, Andreas Rembert Koczulla",2024
Longitudinal evaluation of individuals with severe alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency (Pi*ZZ genotype).,"Homozygous Pi*Z mutation in alpha-1 antitrypsin (Pi*ZZ genotype) predisposes to pulmonary loss-of-function and hepatic gain-of-function injury. To facilitate selection into clinical trials typically targeting only one organ, we systematically evaluated an international, multicenter, longitudinal, Pi*ZZ cohort to uncover natural disease course and surrogates for future liver- and lung-related endpoints.","Malin Fromme, Audrey Payancé, Mattias Mandorfer, Katrine H Thorhauge, Monica Pons, Marc Miravitlles, Jan Stolk, Bart van Hoek, Guido Stirnimann, Sona Frankova, Jan Sperl, Andreas E Kremer, Barbara Burbaum, Christina Schrader, Amine Kadioglu, Michelle Walkenhaus, Carolin V Schneider, Fabienne Klebingat, Lorenz Balcar, Naomi N Kappe, Benedikt Schaefer, Joanna Chorostowska-Wynimko, Elmar Aigner, Sophie Gensluckner, Philipp Striedl, Pauline Roger, John Ryan, Suzanne Roche, Marius Vögelin, Aftab Ala, Heike Bantel, Jef Verbeek, Zoe Mariño, Michael Praktiknjo, Tom J G Gevers, Philipp A Reuken, Thomas Berg, Jacob George, Münevver Demir, Tony Bruns, Christian Trautwein, Heinz Zoller, Michael Trauner, Joan Genesca, William J Griffiths, Virginia Clark, Aleksander Krag, Alice M Turner, Noel G McElvaney, Pavel Strnad",2024
Physical and mental health trajectories: A longitudinal SF-36 analysis in Alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency-associated COPD.,"The Short Form 36-Item Health Survey (SF-36) is a health-related quality of life (HRQoL) measure validated in people with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). While physical health is often more impaired than mental health in people with COPD, research on alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency (AATD)-associated COPD is limited. This longitudinal study examines changes in physical and mental health in individuals with AATD and associated factors.","Radmila Choate, Kristen E Holm, Robert A Sandhaus, David M Mannino, Charlie Strange",2024

Editing approaches to treat Alpha-1 Antitrypsin Deficiency (AATD).,"Alpha-1 antitrypsin (AAT) deficiency (AATD) is a genetic disorder most commonly due to a single G to A point mutation, leading to debilitating lung and/or liver disorders and is associated with increased mortality. The E342K point mutation causes a conformational change of the AAT protein resulting in its retention in liver hepatocytes. This reduces AAT secretion into the serum resulting in higher protease activities due to the lack of inhibition from AAT, causing damage to healthy lung tissue. The current standard of care for lung manifestations involves weekly intravenous augmentation therapy and is considered sub-optimal for these patients. Furthermore, there is currently no approved treatment for liver manifestations. The unmet medical need for AATD patients remains high and new treatment options are needed to treat the underlying disease etiology.","Derek M Erion, Liu Leah Y, Christopher R Brown, Stephen Rennard, Humam Farah",2024
[Reappraisal on the clinical diagnosis and treatment of hereditary liver diseases].,"Hereditary liver diseases are rare conditions characterized by a wide variety of types and very low incidence rate for each one. Their clinical manifestations are diverse, and diagnosis often requires specialized testing, posing a high likelihood of missed or misdiagnosis. Systemic learning the basic knowledge and classification of hereditary liver diseases, as well as an understanding of the clinical features, laboratory findings, imaging, and pathological features of the relatively common hereditary liver diseases in adults, such as Wilson's disease, hemochromatosis, and alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency, is essential. Targeted genetic testing can aid in the timely identification and correct diagnosis of these diseases. Once the etiology is revealed, appropriate treatment can often improve the clinical outcomes and quality of life. Cell therapy and gene therapy represent future directions and may offer the chance of cure for certain conditions. Currently, for patients who have progressed to end-stage liver disease, liver transplantation remains the ultimate treatment option and mostly yield excellent long-term prognosis if the indication and timing are appropriate.",J D Jia,2024
A Multimodal Intervention to Improve Guideline-Based Screening for Alpha-1 Antitrypsin Deficiency in a Community Health Setting.,"Evidence-based guidelines recommend screening all individuals with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) for the genetic disorder alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency (AATD). However, it is estimated that only 5% of people with COPD have been tested for AATD, and a large fraction of the estimated 70,000 to 100,000 Americans with AATD have not yet been diagnosed. Low familiarity with AATD and limited knowledge about diagnostic tests and available treatments contribute to suboptimal screening rates.","Andrew A Wilson, Celia Bora, Catherine Silva, Julie L White, Natalie Sanfratello, Jaime Symowicz, Cristen Querey, Donna Gabriel",2024
Alpha-1 Antitrypsin Deficiency in a Young Never Smoker With Novel Pi*Null Homozygous Mutation: a Case Report.,"Alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency is an autosomal codominant disorder caused by <i>SERPINA1</i> gene mutations. PI*Z and PI*S mutations commonly underlie this deficiency, but rarer homozygous PI*null (Q0) mutations may result in a complete loss of alpha-1 antitrypsin (AAT). Such rare mutations lead to severe AAT deficiency and early onset of lung disease. We present a case of 35-year-old female never-smoker born to consanguineous parents who developed severe panlobular emphysema and end-stage respiratory insufficiency requiring lung transplantation. Subsequent genetic testing identified her as homozygous for a novel <i>c.82del</i> mutation - here named Q0<sub>Bani-Yas</sub> based on the region of the primary carrier's origin - which resulted in undetectable levels of alpha-1 antitrypsin protein.","Igor Z Barjaktarevic, Andrew W Hong, Alyssa Hoover, Stanley Nelson, Said Isse, Se Yoon, Mark Brantley",2024

Impact of Hypoxia on Neutrophil Degranulation and Inflammatory Response in Alpha-1 Antitrypsin Deficiency Patients.,"Alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency (AATD) is an inflammatory disorder where neutrophils play a key role. Excessive neutrophil activation leads to local hypoxia and tissue damage. Most research on neutrophil function has been conducted under atmospheric conditions (21% O<sub>2</sub>), which may not represent physiological or pathological conditions. This study aimed to determine the effects of hypoxia on neutrophil degranulation and cytokine production in AATD patients.","María Magallón, Silvia Castillo-Corullón, Lucía Bañuls, Teresa Romero, Daniel Pellicer, Alberto Herrejón, María Mercedes Navarro-García, Cruz González, Francisco Dasí",2024
Unusual case of liver cirrhosis presenting as a mass compressing the inferior vena cava: A case report.,"Liver cirrhosis is a significant global health burden, accounting for approximately 2 million deaths per year worldwide. The underlying etiologies of cirrhosis include viral hepatitis (hepatitis B, C, and D), toxins (such as alcohol and drugs), autoimmune diseases, cholestatic conditions (including primary biliary cholangitis and primary sclerosing cholangitis), vascular disorders (such as Budd-Chiari syndrome, sinusoidal obstruction syndrome, and cardiac cirrhosis), and metabolic disorders (including hemochromatosis, nonalcoholic steatohepatitis, and alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency). Patients with liver cirrhosis typically present with symptoms such as jaundice, scleral icterus, nausea, and vomiting, accompanied by abnormal liver enzyme levels. Other defining features include spider angiomas, caput medusa, and esophageal and/or rectal varices. Abdominal imaging often reveals fibrotic changes within the liver. In this article, we present a case of a 38-year-old female presenting with signs and symptoms of cirrhosis, with subsequent imaging revealing a Porta hepatis mass compressing the inferior vena cava (IVC). The patient underwent a biopsy consistent with liver cirrhosis. This case is unique in the presentation of her liver cirrhosis as a compressive mass rather than the usual fibrotic changes within the liver parenchyma.","Jack Demirjian, Peter Holleb, Brian DeSalme, Oscar Garcia, Juan Rodriguez Nunez",2024
"Detecting Alpha-1 Antitrypsin Deficiency: Current State, Impediments, Opportunities, and Future Directions.","Alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency (AATD) is an under-recognized condition with only a small minority of affected individuals detected, long delays between initial symptoms and diagnosis, and evidence that affected individuals may see many physicians with suggestive symptoms before an initial diagnosis is made. In the context that failure to detect AATD confers harm and that specific therapy is currently available, there is a clear need for enhanced detection. Impediments to enhanced detection include inadequate knowledge about AATD by physicians caring for at-risk patients, inattention to guidelines which endorse testing, a sense of therapeutic nihilism among some physicians (i.e., the misimpression that because specific therapy is unavailable, there is no imperative to diagnose), and concerns about the cost of testing. Various measures have been undertaken to address these impediments and to enhance detection, including educational programs; targeted detection programs (some with free and home-based confidential testing); population-based, and newborn screening pilot programs, the latter not yet nationally endorsed for large-scale screening. Novel approaches are deploying features of the electronic medical record and of artificial intelligence to prompt testing in at-risk individuals. To the extent that under-recognition of AATD persists with stubbornly long, multi-year diagnostic delay intervals, none of the detection strategies deployed to date has been adequately successful. The path forward regards continued innovation with targeted detection approaches while continuing efforts to assess the impact of population-based screening, hopefully toward ultimate endorsement on a broad national scale.",James K Stoller,2024
Machine-Learning Model Identifies Patients With Alpha-1 Antitrypsin Deficiency Using Claims Records.,"Identifying patients with rare diseases like alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency (AATD) is challenging. Machine-learning models may be trained to identify patients with rare diseases using large-scale, real-world databases, whereas electronic medical records have low numbers of confirmed cases and have limited use in training such models. We applied a machine-learning model to a large US claims database to identify undiagnosed symptomatic patients with AATD. Using deidentified data from the Komodo US claims database (April 26, 2016-January 31, 2023), a model was trained to identify symptomatic patients with high probability of AATD. Eighty claims records for high-probability candidates identified by the model were independently reviewed and validated by 2 clinical experts. The experts independently indicated that of the 80 high-probability candidate patients, 65 (81%) and 62 (78%) patients, respectively, should be tested for AATD. Feedback from this validation step informed model optimization. The optimized model was applied to claims data to identify symptomatic patients with probable AATD. Eleven and 14 ""features"" of the claims data were informative in distinguishing patients with AATD from patients with COPD without AATD and from unspecified chronic liver diseases. Moreover, patients with diagnosed AATD and COPD without AATD had unique cadences of similar medical events in their diagnostic journeys. Our work shows that a machine-learning model trained on a large US claims database can accurately identify symptomatic patients with AATD and provides useful insights into the diagnostic journey of patients with AATD.","Rajani Sharma, D Kyle Hogarth, Richard Colbaugh, Kristin Glass, Adel Mezine, Vassia Liakoni, Christopher Rudolf, Iris Himmelhan, Jimmy Hinson, Marie Sanchirico",2024
Berberine potentiates liver inflammation and fibrosis in the PI*Z hAAT transgenic murine model.,"Alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency (AATD) is an inherited disease, the common variant caused by a Pi*Z mutation in the SERPINA1 gene. Pi*Z AAT increases the risk of pulmonary emphysema and liver disease. Berberine (BBR) is a nature dietary supplement and herbal remedy. Emerging evidence revealed that BBR has remarkable liver-protective properties against various liver diseases. In the present study, we investigated the therapeutic effects and toxicities of BBR in Pi*Z hepatocytes and Pi*Z transgenic mice.","Yuanqing Lu, Naweed S Mohammad, Jungnam Lee, Alek M Aranyos, Karina A Serban, Mark L Brantly",2024
Alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency associated with rare <i>SERPINA1</i> alleles p.(Phe76del) and p.(Asp280Val): A family study.,"This report describes family members with alpha-1 antitrypsin (AAT) deficiency arising from two rare alleles of <i>SERPINA1</i> - p.(Phe76del) and p.(Asp280Val) along with the more common deficiency allele, Pi*Z. The index case, a 51-year-old female presented with cough, bloody sputum, fever, weight loss and night sweats. In addition to a respiratory infection, scans revealed bronchiectasis and bronchiolitis without emphysema. Her AAT level was 30 mg/dL and genetic testing revealed a Pi*Z/p.(Phe76del) genotype. Follow up testing of her relatives revealed the rare p.(Asp280Val) variant as well. AAT deficiency remains underdiagnosed. Early detection and intervention could improve quality of life and outcomes.","Marc Lepiorz, Julius Baier, Martina Veith, Timm Greulich, Michael Pfeifer",2024
Biomarkers Associated With Future Severe Liver Disease in Children With Alpha-1-Antitrypsin Deficiency.,"Children with alpha-1-antitrypsin deficiency (AATD) exhibit a wide range of liver disease outcomes from portal hypertension and transplant to asymptomatic without fibrosis. Individual outcomes cannot be predicted. Liver injury in AATD is caused by the accumulation in hepatocytes of the mutant Z alpha-1-antitrypsin (AAT) protein, especially the toxic, intracellular polymerized conformation. AATD patients have trace Z polymer detectable in serum with unknown significance.","Jeffrey H Teckman, Paula Buchanan, Keith Steven Blomenkamp, Nina Heyer-Chauhan, Keith Burling, David A Lomas",2024

An Electronic Health Record-Based Strategy to Enhance Detection of Alpha-1 Antitrypsin Deficiency.,"Because alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency is severely underrecognized and delayed diagnosis is associated with harm, strategies to enhance early detection of alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency are needed.","Avantika Nathani, James K Stoller",2024
Drug-induced liver injury related to gene therapy: A new challenge to be managed.,"Gene therapy is being successfully developed for the treatment of several genetic disorders. Various methods of gene transfer have been developed to enable the production of the deficient enzyme or protein. One of the most important is adeno-associated virus vectors, which have been shown to be viable for use in in vivo gene therapy. Several gene therapies have already been approved. They are also promising for acquired diseases. Important examples include gene therapy for haemophilia A and B, X-linked myotubular myopathy, spinal muscular atrophy and several liver diseases such as Criggler-Najjar disease, alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency and Fabry disease. However, the introduction of a foreign compound into hepatocytes leads to hepatic reactions with heterogeneous phenotypic expression and a wide spectrum of severity, ranging from mild transaminase elevation to acute liver failure. Several mechanisms appear to be involved in liver injury, including an immune response, but also direct toxicity depending on the method of gene transfer. As a result, the incidence, expression and severity of liver injury vary from indication to indication and from patient to patient. Patients treated for haemophilia A are more prone to transaminase elevation than those treated for haemophilia B. Corticosteroids are successfully used to correct liver reactions but also to prevent degradation of the transferred gene and loss of therapeutic activity. The aim of this review is to describe the risk of liver injury according to the indication for gene therapy and the short- and long-term management currently proposed to prevent or correct liver reactions in clinical practice.","Dominique Larrey, Benedicte Delire, Lucy Meunier, Amel Zahhaf, Eleonora de Martin, Yves Horsmans",2024
Alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency and Pi*Z allele as important co-factors in the development of liver fibrosis.,"Alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency (AATD) is a codominant autosomal hereditary condition that predisposes patients to the development of lung and/or liver disease, and Pi*Z allele is the most clinically relevant mutation.","Ana Isabel Ferreira, Catarina Guimarães, Vitor Macedo Silva, Sofia Xavier, Joana Magalhães, José Cotter",2024
Bronchiectasis Occurs Independently of Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease in Alpha-1 Antitrypsin Deficiency.,"Bronchiectasis occurs in patients with alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency (AATD), but it is unknown whether an association exists independently of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). We assessed whether bronchiectasis was associated with COPD in our cohort, and whether it has clinical significance for lung function decline, exacerbation rate, or symptoms.","Joshua De Soyza, Paul Ellis, Michael Newnham, Lloyd Rickard, Alice M Turner",2024
Prevalence of Alpha-1 Antitrypsin Deficiency Alleles in a Lithuanian Cohort of Wheezing Small Children.,"Severe inherited alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency (AATD) is an autosomal genetic condition linked to chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). The significance of heterozygous, milder deficiency variants (PiSZ, PiMZ, PiMS) is less clear. We studied AATD genotypes in 145 children (up to 72 months old) with assessed wheezing severity using the Pediatric Respiratory Assessment Measure (BCCH PRAM score). A control group of 74 children without airway obstruction was included. AAT concentration and Pi phenotype were determined from dry blood spot samples using nephelometry and real-time PCR; PiS and PiZ alleles were identified by isoelectrofocusing. Among the wheezers, the Pi*S allele incidence was 2.07% (3 cases) and the Pi*Z allele was 6.9% (10 cases). The Pi*Z allele frequency was higher in wheezers compared to controls (44.8% vs. 20.27%) and the general Lithuanian population (44.8% vs. 13.6%) and was similar to adult COPD patients in Lithuania: Pi*S 10.3% vs. 15.8% and Pi*Z 44.8% vs. 46.1%. No association was found between AAT genotypes and wheezing severity. Finding that wheezer children exhibit a frequency of Z* and S* alleles like that found in adults with COPD suggests a potential genetic predisposition that links early wheezing in children to the development of COPD in adulthood. Larger cohort studies are needed to confirm this finding.","Edita Poluzioroviene, Joanna Chorostowska-Wynimko, Sigita Petraitiene, Arunas Strumila, Adriana Rozy, Aneta Zdral, Arunas Valiulis",2024
Assessment and monitoring of lung disease in patients with severe alpha 1 antitrypsin deficiency: a european delphi consensus of the EARCO group.,"Currently, there is conflicting information and guidance on the effective management of Alpha 1 Antitrypsin Deficiency (AATD).

Patterns and unique features of infantile cholestasis among Arabs.,"Most of the literature on infantile cholestasis (IC) originated from Caucasian and Asian populations. The differential diagnosis of IC is very broad, and identification of etiology is challenging to clinicians because the list includes many entities with overlapping clinical, biochemical, and histological features. Thus, a structured, stepwise diagnostic approach is required to help early recognition and prompt evaluation and management of treatable causes of cholestasis.","Abdulrahman Al-Hussaini, Sami Alrashidi, Deema H Hafez, Yasir S Alkhalifah, Bashaer Otayn, Majid Alrasheed, Sumayah Al Mufarreh, Sultan AlKasim",2024
Personalised indication of augmentation therapy for emphysema associated with severe alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency: a case series.,"Severe alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency (AATD) is associated with an increased risk of emphysema. However, the clinical manifestations are very heterogeneous, and an individual prognosis is very difficult to establish. Intravenous augmentation therapy with alpha-1 antitrypsin (AAT) from pooled blood donors is the only specific treatment available, but it requires weekly or biweekly administration for life. Several guidelines provide the indication criteria for the initiation of AAT augmentation therapy. However, in clinical practice, there are situations in which the decision as to when to start treatment becomes uncertain and some studies have shown great variability in the indication of this treatment even among specialists. The usual dilemma is between initiating augmentation therapy in individuals who may not develop significant lung disease or in whom disease will not progress or delaying it in patients who may otherwise rapidly and irreversibly progress. We illustrate this dilemma with five clinical cases: from the case of a patient with normal lung function who requests initiation of therapy to a moderately stable patient without augmentation or a mild patient who, after several years of remaining stable without treatment, deterioration in lung function initiated and, consequently, augmentation therapy was begun. All the nuances associated with the indication of augmentation justify a personalised approach and the decision about initiating augmentation therapy must be made after careful consideration of the pros and cons with the patient in reference centres with experience in treatment. These reference centres can work in collaboration with local hospitals where patients can be closely followed and augmentation therapy can be administered to avoid unnecessary travelling, making periodical administrations more comfortable for the patient.","Cristina Aljama, Teresa Martin, Galo Granados, Marc Miravitlles, Miriam Barrecheguren",2024
Plasma collagen neoepitopes are associated with multiorgan disease in the ACCESS and GRADS sarcoidosis cohorts.,"The pathogenesis of sarcoidosis involves tissue remodelling mediated by the accumulation of abnormal extracellular matrix, which is partly the result of an imbalance in collagen synthesis, cross-linking and degradation. During this process, collagen fragments or neoepitopes, are released into the circulation. The significance of these circulating collagen neoepitopes in sarcoidosis remains unknown.","Jannie Marie Bülow Sand, Henrik Jessen, Diana Julie Leeming, Sheeline Yu, Chris J Lee, Buqu Hu, Ying Sun, Taylor Adams, Taylor Pivarnik, Angela Liu, Samuel Woo, John R McGovern, Vitória Fiorini, Tina Saber, Jean Paul Higuero-Sevilla, Mridu Gulati, Naftali Kaminski, William Damsky, Albert C Shaw, Subhasis Mohanty, Gillian Goobie, Yingze Zhang, Erica Lyndrup Herzog, Changwan Ryu",2024
