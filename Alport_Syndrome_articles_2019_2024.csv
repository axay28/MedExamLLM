Dyspnea and nocturnal cough due to esophageal diffuse leiomyomatosis in a girl with hematuria.,"A 7-year-old girl with hematuria and clinical suspicion of Alport syndrome (AS) presented with dyspnea and nocturnal cough, initially diagnosed and treated as asthma. Despite inhaled corticosteroid therapy, her symptoms persisted, and spirometry indicated obstructive lung function without bronchodilator response. Chest CT revealed diffuse thickening of the esophageal wall, tracheal compression, with involvement of the gastric cardia, suggestive of diffuse leiomyomatosis. Subsequent genetic reanalysis confirmed the presence of a contiguous deletion of COL4A5 and COL4A6 genes, solidifying the diagnosis of AS. Diffuse leiomyomatosis, a rare benign neoplasm associated with AS, typically manifests as dysphagia, but in this case, it presented initially with asthma-like symptoms. This case emphasizes the importance of imaging when asthma treatment fails, particularly in patients with coexisting conditions of another system.","Sun Woo Park, Minjeong Lee, Hee Gyung Kang, Jin Soo Moon, Hyun-Young Kim, Ji Soo Park",2024
[Genetics in nephrology - any news?].,"While genetic kidney diseases were long regarded as a rare cause of kidney failure, it has been shown in recent years that they account for a relevant proportion of cases. In cohorts of kidney transplant recipients, a monogenic cause is found in up to 30% of cases. Identifying the genetic cause of kidney disease has become much easier thanks to technological advances in DNA sequencing. The focus has now shifted to understanding the significance of the findings and identifying diagnostic gaps. It is still not possible to clarify all CKD cases of unclear aetiology. Besides very effective generic treatments for monogenic kidney disease (e.g., ACE-inhibitor use in Alport Syndrome), increasing knowledge of the pathophysiology of genetic kidney diseases has led to a growing number of targeted therapies. These include the treatment of ADPKD with Tolvaptan, which has now been in use for 10 years. Recently, exciting, and completely new approaches have been added, such as the first siRNA therapies in nephrology for primary hyperoxaluria type 1, the targeted treatment of hyperphagia in Bardet-Biedl syndrome, the therapy of APOL1-associated kidney disease or the use of the HIF-2 antagonist Belzutifan for renal cell carcinoma associated with Von-Hippel-Lindau syndrome. The new possibilities in the treatment of patients with genetic kidney diseases have also clearly revealed deficits in current patient care. Centers of excellence with extensive experience in this area therefore play an important role in improving care. This also applies to the further training of colleagues in the field. In Germany, the National Action Alliance for People with Rare Diseases (NAMSE) and the nationwide establishment of - to date - 36 centers for rare diseases play an important role in this regard.","Malte P Bartram, Bodo B Beck, Roman-Ulrich Müller",2024
Investigation of exon skipping therapy in kidney organoids from Alport syndrome patients derived iPSCs.,"Alport syndrome (AS) is a hereditary disease caused by mutations in the COL4A5 gene and leads to chronic kidney disease. Currently, no specific treatment has been developed. However, a recent study using AS-model mice demonstrated that the exon skipping method could partially rescue the symptoms. In this study, we evaluated the effects of the exon skipping method using kidney organoids generated from AS-patient-derived induced pluripotent stem cells (AS-iPSCs). We generated kidney organoids from AS-iPSCs, which exhibited nephron structures. As expected, the C-terminus of COL4A5 was not expressed in AS-organoids. Interestingly, anti-sense oligonucleotides restored the expression of the C-terminus of COL4A5 in vitro. Next, we transplanted AS-organoids into mice and evaluated glomerular basement membrane formation in vivo. We found that AS-organoids formed a lower slit diaphragm ratio compared to control organoids. Finally, we assessed the effects of exon skipping on transplanted organoids but observed minimum effects. These studies suggest that AS-iPSCs can generate kidney organoids lacking the C-terminus of COL4A5, and that exon skipping can induce its expression in vitro.","Kensuke Yabuuchi, Tomoko Horinouchi, Tomohiko Yamamura, Kandai Nozu, Minoru Takasato",2024

A novel deep learning approach for analyzing glomerular basement membrane lesions in a mouse model of X-linked Alport syndrome.,"Alport syndrome is a rare kidney disease typically more severe in males due to its X-linked inheritance. However, female patients with heterozygous X-linked Alport syndrome (XLAS) can develop renal failure over time, necessitating accurate pathological assessment for effective therapy. A key pathological finding in female XLAS patients is the mosaic pattern of partial loss of α5 chains of type IV collagen. This study, using a mouse model of XLAS with a nonsense mutation (R471*) in the Col4a5 gene, analogous to human XLAS, aimed to examine the consistency of this pattern with the glomerular basement membrane (GBM) structure. A modified periodic acid-methenamine silver (PAMS) staining method was developed for clearer GBM visualization. The integrated images from COL4α5-stained fluorescence, PAMS, and low-vacuum scanning electron microscopy (LVSEM) into a single-slide section and applied supervised deep learning to predict GBM lesions. Results showed significant individual variability in urinary protein levels and histological lesions. Pathological parameters, including crescent formation, focal segmental glomerulosclerosis, and the COL4α5/α2 ratio, correlated with clinical parameters like urinary protein and plasma creatinine levels. Integrated LVSEM analysis revealed dense GBM regions corresponded to areas where COL4α5 was preserved, while coarse GBM (basket-weave lesions) occurred in COL4α5-deficient regions. These advanced techniques can enhance biopsy-based diagnosis of Alport syndrome and aid in developing AI diagnostic tools for diseases involving basement membrane lesions.","Kunio Kawanishi, Masaki Baba, Ryosuke Kobayashi, Ryotaro Hori, Kentaro Hashikami, Kenta Danbayashi, Takako Iwachido, Mitsuyasu Kato",2024
Slowly progressive autosomal dominant Alport Syndrome due to COL4A3 splicing variant.,"Alport syndrome is a rare genetic kidney disease caused by variants in the COL4A3/A4/A5 genes. It's characterised by progressive kidney failure, though therapies targeting Renin-Angiotensin System can delay its progression. Additionally, extrarenal manifestations may sometimes coexist. Recent advances in genetic analysis and the necessity to better clarify genotype-phenotype correlations in affected patients raises the importance of detecting even cryptic splicing variants, lying in both canonical and non-canonical splice sites variants such as last exonic nucleotide variants. These variants, often, do not cause an amino acid change but alter the snRNP proteins binding. We studied a big Italian family with Alport syndrome showing a clear dominant pattern of transmission with younger family members having only haematuria and older individuals presenting with End-Stage Kidney Failure (ESKF). Kidney biopsy showed the typical disease hallmarks. We deeply mined the data for SNV and CNV through exome sequencing on DNA from both peripheral blood samples and patients' podocytes-lineage cells. We identified an already reported synonymous variant, c.765G>A (p.(Thr255Thr)), in the last exonic nucleotide of exon 13 of the COL4A3 gene. Employing the patient's podocytes we demonstrated that this variant results in exon skipping leading to an in-frame deletion of 28 amino acids without leaky effect. According to the pattern of transmission, to the kidney biopsy and to the exome data analysis we provided further evidence that autosomal dominant Alport syndrome is a well-defined clinical entity. We also confirmed the pathogenicity of the synonymous COL4A3 variant for the first time demonstrating its role in a dominant pattern of transmission.","Sergio Daga, Lorenzo Loberti, Giulia Rollo, Loredaria Adamo, Olga Lorenza Colavecchio, Giulia Brunelli, Kristina Zguro, Sergio Antonio Tripodi, Andrea Guarnieri, Guido Garosi, Romina D'Aurizio, Francesca Ariani, Rossella Tita, Alessandra Renieri, Anna Maria Pinto",2024
Alport Syndrome With a Rare Collagen Type IV Alpha-4 (COL4A4) Gene Mutation: A Case Report.,"Alport syndrome (AS) is a rare, progressive hereditary kidney disease characterized by sensorineural hearing loss and visual abnormalities. It is caused by a mutation in the collagen type IV alpha-4 (COL4A4) gene, which produces type IV collagen, and often manifests in individuals with hematuria, proteinuria, edema, and hypertension. Here, we present a case of AS in a 15-year-old boy with a COL4A4 gene mutation, with renal and extrarenal findings. The patient presented with subnephrotic proteinuria and microscopic hematuria, autoimmune hypothyroidism, and keratoconus. Light microscopy examination of renal biopsy revealed three globally sclerosed renal cortical parenchyma areas with periglomerular fibrosis, and electron microscopy showed variable thickness of glomerular basement membrane with festooned appearance, as well as splitting of lamina densa giving basket weave and criss-cross pattern.","Akshaya Rana, Surekha Tayade",2024
Investigation of current clinical practices and perceptions of patients and caregivers regarding Alport syndrome in South Korea.,Alport syndrome (AS) is a highly prevalent inherited kidney disease.

Pathological diagnosis of Alport syndrome.,"Alport syndrome (AS) is a hereditary nephritis characterized by structural abnormalities in the glomerular basement membrane resulting from pathogenic variants in the COL4A3, COL4A4, and COL4A5 genes. Conventional pathological evaluations reveal nonspecific light microscopic changes and diagnostic clues can be obtained through electron microscopy. Type IV collagen staining elucidates distinct patterns based on AS inheritance, aiding in subtype classification. However, limitations arise, particularly in autosomal dominant cases. Genetic testing, particularly next-generation sequencing, gains prominence due to its ability to identify diverse mutations within COL4A3, COL4A4, and COL4A5.","Kyoung Bun Lee, Minsun Jung, Beom Jin Lim",2024
"A comprehensive review of Alport syndrome: definition, pathophysiology, clinical manifestations, and diagnostic considerations.","Alport syndrome, a rare genetic disorder affecting around 1 in 50,000 individuals, primarily presents as microscopic hematuria and chronic kidney disease (CKD) with associated extrarenal complications. The Alport syndrome results from mutations in COL4A3, COL4A4, and COL4A5 genes, disrupting the formation of the α3-α4-α5 chain in the collagen IV network. The etiology involves X chromosome-related, autosomal dominant, autosomal recessive, and digenic inheritance patterns. The disease primarily manifests as kidney involvement, featuring persistent hematuria, proteinuria, and a progressive decline in renal function. Hearing loss, ocular abnormalities, and extrarenal manifestations further contribute to its complexity. Genotype-phenotype correlations are relatively evident, with distinct presentations in X-linked, autosomal recessive, and autosomal dominant cases. Diagnosis relies on urinalysis, histologic examination, and genetic testing with advancements in next-generation sequencing aiding identification. Although no specific treatment exists, early diagnosis improves outcomes, emphasizing the importance of genetic testing for prognosis and familial screening. The purpose of this review is to advance knowledge and enhance understanding of Alport syndrome.","Eunjeong Kang, Byung Hwa Park, Hajeong Lee, Hee Gyung Kang, Ji Hyun Kim, Ye Na Kim, Yeonsoon Jung, Hark Rim, Ho Sik Shin",2024
Aberrant serum-derived FN1 variants bind to integrin β1 on glomerular endothelial cells contributing to thin basement membrane nephropathy.,"The glomerular basement membrane (GBM) is a critical component of the glomerular filtration barrier (GFB), with its thickness directly influencing renal function. While a uniformly thinned GBM can cause hematuria while preserving normal renal function, this condition is typically diagnosed as thin basement membrane nephropathy (TBMN). However, the pathogenesis and potential progression to renal insufficiency of TBMN are not fully understood. In this study, we analyzed clinical cohorts presenting with microscopic hematuria who underwent genetic testing and identified five novel pathogenic FN1 mutations. Through bioinformatics analysis of these variants, expression localization analysis of GBM-related molecules in renal biopsies, and functional studies of the mutants, we found that these variants exhibited gain-of-function characteristics. This led to the excessive deposition of aberrant serum-derived FN1 variants on glomerular endothelial cells rather than cell-type-specific variants. The deposition competitively binds FN1 variants to Integrin β1, disrupting the interaction with Laminin α5β2γ1 and subsequently reducing the expression of key GBM components, resulting in TBMN. This study elucidated, for the first time, the genetic pathogenesis of TBMN caused by FN1 variants. It provides a crucial foundation for understanding the progression of renal dysfunction associated with simple hematuria, highlights the potential for targeted therapeutic strategies, and differentiates TBMN from early-stage Alport syndrome.","Xindi Zhou, Wanbing Chen, Chun Gan, Dan Chen, Han Xiao, Yaru Jiang, Qing Yang, Huimin Jiang, Xuejun Yang, Baohui Yang, Yaxi Chen, Mo Wang, Haiping Yang, Wei Jiang, Qiu Li",2024
Matrix metalloproteinases in kidney homeostasis and diseases: an update.,"Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) are zinc-dependent endopeptidases with important roles in kidney homeostasis and pathology. While capable of collectively degrading each component of the extracellular matrix, MMPs also degrade nonmatrix substrates to regulate inflammation, epithelial plasticity, proliferation, apoptosis, and angiogenesis. More recently, intriguing mechanisms that directly alter podocyte biology have been described. There is now irrefutable evidence for MMP dysregulation in many types of kidney disease including acute kidney injury, diabetic and hypertensive nephropathy, polycystic kidney disease and Alport syndrome. This updated review will detail the complex biology of MMPs in kidney disease.","Roderick J Tan, Youhua Liu",2024
Detection of Alport gene variants in children and young people with persistent haematuria.,"Genetic kidney disease is an important cause of persistent microscopic haematuria in children and young people. We aimed to determine the frequency of variants in the Alport syndrome genes (COL4A3, COL4A4 or COL4A5) in individuals under 18 years of age presenting with persistent microscopic haematuria to a single specialist centre in the UK over a 10-year period.","Natasha Su Lynn Ng, Tomohiko Yamamura, Mohan Shenoy, Helen M Stuart, Rachel Lennon",2024
First patient diagnosed with lipoprotein glomerulopathy and Alport syndrome.,"Alport syndrome (AS) is one of the most common inherited kidney disorders, involving pathogenic variants of COL4A3, COL4A4 and COL4A5 genes that lead to disruption of the normal structure of collagen IV protein through improper chain or heterotrimer folding or degradation of heterotrimer components. Lipoprotein glomerulopathy (LPG) is an autosomal dominant disease involving APOE gene mutations disturbing lipoprotein metabolism. We report the first case with both AS and LPG in an 11-year-old girl. The patient presented with blepharedema, and decreased vision. Laboratory examinations showed hematemesis, proteinuria, hypoproteinemia, hyperlipidemia and progressive renal failure. Renal biopsy showed the changes of LPG and AS. Whole-exome sequencing (WES) identified two pathogenic variants, c.127C > T in exon 3 of APOE gene, and c.930 + 1G > A in exon 15 of COL4A4 gene. We emphasize the importance of early completion of renal biopsy and WES for early diagnosis of LPG and AS.","Lianlian Yang, Guang Yang, Hui Guo",2024

Preclinical Detection of Early Glomerular Injury in Children with Kidney Diseases-Independently of Usual Markers of Kidney Impairment and Inflammation.,"Glomerular kidney diseases typically begin insidiously and can progress to end stage kidney failure. Early onset of therapy can slow down disease progression. Early diagnosis is required to ensure such timely therapy. The goal of our study was to evaluate protein biomarkers (BMs) for common nephropathies that have been described for children with Alport syndrome. Nineteen candidate BMs were determined by commercial ELISA in children with congenital anomalies of the kidneys and urogenital tract, inflammatory kidney injury, or diabetes mellitus. It is particularly essential to search for kidney disease BMs in children because they are a crucial target group that likely exhibits early disease stages and in which misleading diseases unrelated to the kidney are rare. Only minor differences in blood between affected individuals and controls were found. However, in urine, several biomarker candidates alone or in combination seemed to be promising indicators of renal injury in early disease stages. The BMs of highest sensitivity and specificity were collagen type XIII, hyaluronan-binding protein 2, and complement C4-binding protein. These proteins are unrelated to inflammation markers or to risk factors for and signs of renal failure. In conclusion, our study evaluated several strong candidates for screening for early stages of kidney diseases and can help to establish early nephroprotective regimens.","Heidrun Rhode, Baerbel Tautkus, Friederike Weigel, Julia Schitke, Oliver Metzing, Jan Boeckhaus, Wieland Kiess, Oliver Gross, Axel Dost, Ulrike John-Kroegel",2024
Denovo glomerulonephritis associated with IgA anti-GBM alloantibodies after kidney transplantation in Alport syndrome: A case report with diagnostic implications.,"Alport syndrome (AS) is a hereditary disorder caused by pathogenic variants in COL4A3, COL4A4, or COL4A5 genes expressing α3, α4, and α5 chains of basement membrane type IV collagen (COL4). The triple-helical α3α4α5(IV) protomer is a major component of the mature glomerular basement membrane (GBM) whose defective formation in AS leads to structural GBM disruption and kidney dysfunction, often resulting in kidney replacement therapy. A genetically intact renal graft exposes the immune system to a non-tolerized α3α4α5(IV) component and an alloimmune response eventually ensues. So far, only IgG alloantibodies reacting against COL4 have been reported in AS alloimmune responses. Here, we report alloimmune glomerulonephritis mediated by IgA antibodies against the non-collagenous C-terminal domain 1 of the α5(IV) chain in a patient with autosomal recessive AS following a second kidney transplantation. The patient presented a not previously described biallelic variant in the COL4A4 gene. Immunological, diagnostic, and clinical implications are discussed.","Marina Segura-Guerrero, Carlos Saus, Roberto Gozalbo-Rovira, Sheila Cabello-Pelegrín, María Luisa Vargas, Natalia Martínez-Pomar, Jesús Rodríguez-Díaz, Juan Saus, Maria Rosa Julià",2024
Alport Syndrome: Clinical Utility of Early Genetic Diagnosis in Children.,"Alport syndrome (AS) is a hereditary glomerulopathy due to pathogenic variants in <i>COL4A3</i>, <i>COL4A4</i>, and <i>COL4A5.</i> Treatment with Renin-Angiotensin-Aldosterone System (RAAS) inhibitors can delay progression to end stage renal disease (ESRD). From 2018 until today, we performed Whole Exome Sequencing (WES) in 19 patients with AS phenotype with or without positive family history. Fourteen of these patients were children. Genetic testing was extended to family members at risk. All patients received a genetic diagnosis of AS: five X-linked AS (XLAS) males, five X-linked AS (XLAS) females, six autosomal dominant AS (ADAS), and one autosomal recessive AS (ARAS). After cascade screening four XLAS males and eight XLAS females, six ADAS and three ARAS heterozygotes were added to our initial results. Fifteen patients were eligible to start treatment with RAAS inhibitors after their diagnosis. All XLAS female patients, ARAS heterozygotes, and ADAS have been advised to be followed up, so that therapeutic intervention can begin in the presence of microalbuminuria. Genetic diagnosis of AS ensures early therapeutic intervention and appropriate follow up to delay progression to chronic kidney disease, especially in thet pediatric population.","Vasileia Christodoulaki, Konstantina Kosma, Nikolaos M Marinakis, Faidon-Nikolaos Tilemis, Nikolaos Stergiou, Afroditi Kampouraki, Charalampos Kapogiannis, Vasiliki Karava, Andromachi Mitsioni, Maria Mila, Christina Kanaka-Gantenbein, Periklis Makrythanasis, Maria Tzetis, Joanne Traeger-Synodinos",2024
Fenestrated Endothelial Cells across Organs: Insights into Kidney Function and Disease.,"In the human body, the vascular system plays an indispensable role in maintaining homeostasis by supplying oxygen and nutrients to cells and organs and facilitating the removal of metabolic waste and toxins. Blood vessels-the key constituents of the vascular system-are composed of a layer of endothelial cells on their luminal surface. In most organs, tightly packed endothelial cells serve as a barrier separating blood and lymph from surrounding tissues. Intriguingly, endothelial cells in some tissues and organs (e.g., choroid plexus, liver sinusoids, small intestines, and kidney glomerulus) form transcellular pores called fenestrations that facilitate molecular and ionic transport across the vasculature and mediate immune responses through leukocyte transmigration. However, the development and unique functions of endothelial cell fenestrations across organs are yet to be fully uncovered. This review article provides an overview of fenestrated endothelial cells in multiple organs. We describe their development and organ-specific roles, with expanded discussions on their contributions to glomerular health and disease. We extend these discussions to highlight the dynamic changes in endothelial cell fenestrations in diabetic nephropathy, focal segmental glomerulosclerosis, Alport syndrome, and preeclampsia, and how these unique cellular features could be targeted for therapeutic development. Finally, we discuss emerging technologies for in vitro modeling of biological systems, and their relevance for advancing the current understanding of endothelial cell fenestrations in health and disease.","Xingrui Mou, Sophia M Leeman, Yasmin Roye, Carmen Miller, Samira Musah",2024

Paediatric diffuse oesophageal leiomyomatosis with Alport syndrome.,"Diffuse oesophageal leiomyomatosis is a rare benign disease in the paediatric population. This report highlights a recent clinical case, together with a narrative review of current world literature.An early middle childhood girl with recurrent lower respiratory tract infections for 2 years was noted to have a retrocardiac lesion on chest X-ray, later confirmed to be an oesophageal mass on CT imaging. She underwent an Ivor-Lewis oesophagogastrectomy and a Heineke-Mikulicz pyloroplasty. Pathology examination revealed type I diffuse oesophageal leiomyomatosis. Alport syndrome was later confirmed following an episode of postoperative haematuria, which was corroborated by electron microscopy examination following renal biopsy.With an oesophageal mass lesion and Alport syndrome, oesophageal leiomyomatosis should be suspected in any patient with a clinical history of dysphagia and/or respiratory symptoms. Endoscopic ultrasound-guided tissue biopsy is valuable for diagnosis of all suspected lesions. Surgical resection is mandatory to effect cure.","Pornsri Thanachatchairattana, Paul Losty",2024
Chemical chaperones to the rescue of Alport syndrome?,"Alport syndrome is a hereditary kidney disease caused by collagen IV mutations that interfere with the formation and deposition of the α3α4α5 protomer into the glomerular basement membrane. In this issue, Yu et al. show that the chemical chaperone tauroursodeoxycholic acid prevented kidney structural changes and function decline in mice with a pathogenic missense Col4a3 mutation by increasing mutant α3α4α5 protomer glomerular basement membrane deposition and preventing podocyte apoptosis induced by endoplasmic reticulum stress.",Roberto M Vanacore,2024
Scrotal edema due to bilateral metachronous tears in the spigelian fascia in a peritoneal dialysis patient: A case report.,"Scrotal and penile edema is a noninfectious complication of peritoneal dialysis (PD). A tear in the Spigelian fascia is occasionally recognized as a Spigelian hernia. However, there is no documented evidence that this is a contributing factor for scrotal edema in individuals undergoing PD. We encountered a case of scrotal edema in a patient undergoing PD due to bilateral metachronous tears in the Spigelian fascia, which was successfully treated through surgical repair. A 20-year-old man with end-stage kidney disease due to Alport syndrome underwent PD. Eight months after induction of PD, he heard a rupture sound in the left inguinal region after coughing and developed genital edema. A computed tomography scan showed a tear in the left Spigelian fascia. Surgical repair was successful and there was no recurrence after PD was resumed. Seven months after surgery, he heard a rupture sound in the right inguinal region after coughing and developed genital edema. A computed tomography scan showed a tear in the right Spigelian fascia. Surgical repair was successful and there has been no recurrence since. It is important to recognize that the development of scrotal edema in a patient undergoing PD may be indicative of a tear in the Spigelian fascia.","Kentaro Watanabe, Kosuke Fukuoka, Mana Nishikawa, Motoko Kanzaki, Noriaki Shimada, Kenichiro Asano",2024
