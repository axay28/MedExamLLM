Oxidative Stress-mediated Lipid Peroxidation-derived Lipid Aldehydes in the Pathophysiology of Neurodegenerative Diseases.,"Neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis cause damage and gradual loss of neurons affecting the central nervous system. Neurodegenerative diseases are most commonly seen in the ageing process. Ageing causes increased reactive oxygen species and decreased mitochondrial ATP generation, resulting in redox imbalance and oxidative stress. Oxidative stress-generated free radicals cause damage to membrane lipids containing polyunsaturated fatty acids, leading to the formation of toxic lipid aldehyde products such as 4- hydroxynonenal and malondialdehyde. Several studies have shown that lipid peroxidation-derived aldehyde products form adducts with cellular proteins, altering their structure and function. Thus, these lipid aldehydes could act as secondary signaling intermediates, modifying important metabolic pathways, and contributing to the pathophysiology of several human diseases, including neurodegenerative disorders. Additionally, they could serve as biomarkers for disease progression. This narrative review article discusses the biological and clinical significance of oxidative stress-mediated lipid peroxidation-derived lipid aldehydes in the pathophysiology of various neurodegenerative diseases.","Kieran Allowitz, Justin Taylor, Kyra Harames, John Yoo, Omar Baloch, Kota V Ramana",2024
Dynactin-1 mediates rescue of impaired axonal transport due to reduced mitochondrial bioenergetics in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis motor neurons.,"Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a neurodegenerative disease of the motor system with complex determinants, including genetic and non-genetic factors. A key pathological signature of ALS is the cytoplasmic mislocalization and aggregation of TDP-43 in affected motor neurons, which is found in 97% of cases. Recent reports have shown that mitochondrial dysfunction plays a significant role in motor neuron degeneration in ALS, and TDP-43 modulates several mitochondrial transcripts. In this study, we used induced pluripotent stem cell-derived motor neurons from ALS patients with TDP-43 mutations and a transgenic TDP-43<sup>M337V</sup> mouse model to determine how TDP-43 mutations alter mitochondrial function and axonal transport. We detected significantly reduced mitochondrial respiration and ATP production in patient induced pluripotent stem cell-derived motor neurons, linked to an interaction between TDP-43<sup>M337V</sup> with ATPB and COX5A. A downstream reduction in speed of retrograde axonal transport in patient induced pluripotent stem cell-derived motor neurons was detected, which correlated with downregulation of the motor protein complex, DCTN1/dynein. Overexpression of DCTN1 in patient induced pluripotent stem cell-derived motor neurons significantly increased the percentage of retrograde travelling mitochondria and reduced the percentage of stationary mitochondria. This study shows that ALS induced pluripotent stem cell-derived motor neurons with mutations in TDP-43 have deficiencies in essential mitochondrial functions with downstream effects on retrograde axonal transport, which can be partially rescued by DCTN1 overexpression.","Ruxandra Dafinca, Carlota Tosat-Bitrian, Emily Carroll, Björn F Vahsen, Javier Gilbert-Jaramillo, Jakub Scaber, Emily Feneberg, Errin Johnson, Kevin Talbot",2024
A review of proposed mechanisms for neurodegenerative disease.,"Neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) affect millions and present significant challenges in healthcare and treatment costs. The debate in the field pivots around two hypotheses: synaptic spread and selective vulnerability. Pioneers like Virginia Lee and John Trojanowski have been instrumental in identifying key proteins (tau, alpha-synuclein, TDP-43) central to these diseases. The synaptic spread hypothesis suggests a cell-to-cell propagation of pathogenic proteins across neuronal synapses, influencing disease progression, with studies highlighting the role of proteins like alpha-synuclein and amyloid-beta in this process. In contrast, the selective vulnerability hypothesis proposes inherent susceptibility of certain neurons to degeneration due to factors like metabolic stress, leading to protein aggregation. Recent advancements in neuroimaging, especially PET/MRI hybrid imaging, offer new insights into these mechanisms. While both hypotheses offer substantial evidence, their relative contributions to neurodegenerative processes remain to be fully elucidated. This uncertainty underscores the necessity for continued research, with a focus on these hypotheses, to develop effective treatments for these devastating diseases.","Benjamin M Kelser, Eric M Teichner, Robert C Subtirelu, Kevin N Hoss",2024
Mechanism-free repurposing of drugs for C9orf72-related ALS/FTD using large-scale genomic data.,"Repeat expansions in the C9orf72 gene are the most common genetic cause of (ALS) and frontotemporal dementia (FTD). Like other genetic forms of neurodegeneration, pinpointing the precise mechanism(s) by which this mutation leads to neuronal death remains elusive, and this lack of knowledge hampers the development of therapy for C9orf72-related disease. We used an agnostic approach based on genomic data (n = 41,273 ALS and healthy samples, and n = 1,516 C9orf72 carriers) to overcome these bottlenecks. Our drug-repurposing screen, based on gene- and expression-pattern matching and information about the genetic variants influencing onset age among C9orf72 carriers, identified acamprosate, a γ-aminobutyric acid analog, as a potentially repurposable treatment for patients carrying C9orf72 repeat expansions. We validated its neuroprotective effect in cell models and showed comparable efficacy to riluzole, the current standard of care. Our work highlights the potential value of genomics in repurposing drugs in situations where the underlying pathomechanisms are inherently complex.

The neuropharmacological and clinical effects of lutein: a systematic review.,"Neurodegenerative diseases are defined by specific protein accumulation and anatomic vulnerability leading to neuronal loss. Some studies have shown that lutein may have an effect on neurodegenerative diseases. As most of the neurodegenerative diseases don't have certain cure and therapies focus on symptom control, Lutein may be a complementary treatment. Due to controversies in studies investigating lutein effect on neurodegenerative diseases, we decided to perform a systematic review on these studies.","Atefeh Arab Firozjae, Mohammad Reza Shiran, Mohsen Rashidi",2024

Targeting capabilities of engineered extracellular vesicles for the treatment of neurological diseases.,"Recent advances in research on extracellular vesicles have significantly enhanced their potential as therapeutic agents for neurological diseases. Owing to their therapeutic properties and ability to cross the blood-brain barrier, extracellular vesicles are recognized as promising drug delivery vehicles for various neurological conditions, including ischemic stroke, traumatic brain injury, neurodegenerative diseases, glioma, and psychosis.However, the clinical application of natural extracellular vesicles is hindered by their limited targeting ability and short clearance from the body. To address these limitations, multiple engineering strategies have been developed to enhance the targeting capabilities of extracellular vesicles, thereby enabling the delivery of therapeutic contents to specific tissues or cells. Therefore, this review aims to highlight the latest advancements in natural and targeting-engineered extracellular vesicles, exploring their applications in treating traumatic brain injury, ischemic stroke, Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, glioma, and psychosis. Additionally, we summarized recent clinical trials involving extracellular vesicles and discussed the challenges and future prospects of using targeting-engineered extracellular vesicles for drug delivery in treating neurological diseases. This review offers new insights for developing highly targeted therapies in this field.","Xinyu Yang, Xiangyu Gao, Xiaofan Jiang, Kangyi Yue, Peng Luo",2024
"CSF and blood levels of Neurofilaments, T-Tau, P-Tau, and Abeta-42 in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis: a systematic review and meta-analysis.","Recent literature suggests that markers of neuroaxonal damage, such as neurofilaments and tau protein, might serve as potential biomarkers for ALS. We conducted this systematic review and meta-analysis study to compare cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and blood levels of total tau (t-tau), phosphorylated tau (p-tau), amyloid beta peptide 42 (Abeta-42), and neurofilaments in ALS patients and controls. A systematic search of Cochrane Library, PubMed, Embase, and ISI Web of Science was conducted on March 18, 2022, and updated on January 26, 2023. Observational studies that compared the concentrations of neurofilament light chain (NfL), neurofilament heavy chain (NFH), t-tau, p-tau, or Abeta-42 in CSF or peripheral blood of ALS patients and controls were included. Data from relevant studies were independently extracted and screened for quality using a standard tool, by at least two authors. Meta-analysis was conducted when a minimum of 3 studies reported the same biomarker within the same biofluid. A total of 100 studies were eligible for at least one meta-analysis. CSF and blood levels of NfL (standardized mean difference (SMD) [95% CI]; CSF: 1.46 [1.25-1.68]; blood: 1.35 [1.09-1.60]) and NFH (CSF: 1.32 [1.13-1.50], blood: 0.90 [0.58-1.22]) were significantly higher in ALS patients compared with controls. The pooled differences between ALS patients and controls were not significant for CSF t-tau, blood t-tau, and CSF Abeta-42, but CSF p-tau was lower in ALS patients (-0.27 [-0.47- -0.07]). Significantly decreased p-tau/t-tau ratios were found in ALS patients compared with controls (-0.84 [-1.16- -0.53]). Heterogeneity was considerable in most of our meta-analyses. CSF and blood neurofilament levels, as well as the CSF p-tau/t-tau ratio, might be potential candidates for improving ALS diagnosis. Further research is warranted to better understand the underlying mechanisms and the clinical implications of these biomarker alterations.","Elmira Agah, Helia Mojtabavi, Atefeh Behkar, Arash Heidari, Atra Ajdari, Zoha Shaka, Seyed Vahid Mousavi, Negar Firoozeh, Abbas Tafakhori, Nima Rezaei",2024
Elevated peripheral inflammation is associated with choroid plexus enlargement in independent sporadic amyotrophic lateral sclerosis cohorts.,"Using neuroimaging techniques, growing evidence has suggested that the choroid plexus (CP) volume is enlarged in multiple neurodegenerative diseases, including amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Notably, the CP has been suggested to play an important role in inflammation-induced CNS damage under disease conditions. However, to our knowledge, no study has investigated the relationships between peripheral inflammation and CP volume in sporadic ALS patients. Thus, in this study, we aimed to verify CP enlargement and explore its association with peripheral inflammation in vivo in independent ALS cohorts.","Sujuan Sun, Yujing Chen, Yan Yun, Bing Zhao, Qingguo Ren, Xiaohan Sun, Xiangshui Meng, Chuanzhu Yan, Pengfei Lin, Shuangwu Liu",2024

"Small organism models for mode of action research on anti-ageing and nootropic herbs, foods, and formulations.","With global increase in ageing population along with increasing age-related neurodegenerative diseases (NDs), development of sustainable, safe and effective solutions for promoting healthy ageing and preventing diseases has become a priority. Traditional healthcare systems/medicines prescribe several herbs, foods and formulations to promote healthy ageing and prevent and/or treat age-related diseases. However, the scientific data elucidating their mechanism of action is very limited and deeper research using different models is warranted for timely and wider use. The clinical studies and research with higher model organisms, although useful, have several practical, technical, and financial limitations. Conversely, small organism models like Yeast, Roundworm, Fruit fly, and Zebrafish, which have genetic similarities to humans, can replicate the disease features and provide behavioural, cellular and molecular insights. The common features of ageing and NDs, like amyloid protein aggregations, oxidative stress, energy dysregulation, inflammation and neurodegeneration can be mimicked in the small organism models for Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, Huntington's diseases, and Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis. This review focuses on small organism model- based research unveiling interesting modes of action and synergistic effects of herbal extracts, foods, and formulations, which are indicated especially for healthy ageing and management of NDs. This will provide leads for the quick and sustainable development of scientifically evaluated solutions for clinically relevant, age-related conditions.","Jalagam Anjaneyulu, Ashwini Godbole",2024
NIV@Home: a pilot randomized controlled trial of in-home noninvasive ventilation initiation compared to a single-day admission model.,"<i>Objective</i>: Noninvasive ventilation (NIV) is the primary treatment for respiratory insufficiency in neuromuscular disease. NIV implementation is usually conducted within hospitals; however, in-home implementation with intensive follow-up is an effective alternative. This pilot study aimed to assess model feasibility, acceptability, and NIV usage at 12-weeks after a single visit in-home implementation of NIV with remote monitoring follow-up (NIV@Home) compared to an in-hospital day admission NIV initiation plus planned polysomnography (Usual care). <i>Methods</i>: A single-blinded randomized controlled trial (www.anzctr.org.au ACTRN12620000682943) of adults with neuromuscular disease referred for NIV implementation. Participants were stratified by disease (MND or Other diagnoses) and bulbar symptoms before randomization to NIV@Home or Usual care, with follow-up at 12-weeks. The primary outcome was NIV usage. Secondary outcomes included feasibility, health-related quality of life, symptoms, carer burden, and NIV experience (semi-structured qualitative interviews). <i>Results</i>: Twenty-three participants (MND bulbar = 9, MND non-bulbar = 11, Other = 3) were randomized (NIV@Home = 9). No statistical differences were observed in the percentage of MND participants using NIV for >4 hours/day (NIV@Home = 33% vs. Usual care = 60%, <i>p</i> = 0.370), average use (NIV@Home = 2.4 [1.5-9.3] vs. 5.3 [1.8-7.0] hours/day, <i>p</i> = 0.568), or secondary outcomes. In-home NIV implementation was feasible and safe but took more therapist time (NIV@Home = 278 [270-305] vs. 172 [130-200] minutes, <i>p</i> < 0.001). Participants in the NIV@Home group reported substantial advantages to receiving care in home. <i>Conclusion</i>: In-home NIV implementation is feasible and acceptable to people with MND but requires more therapist time. Larger studies are required to determine whether there are clinically important differences between this model of NIV initiation and a traditional hospital-based model.","Nicole L Sheers, Liam M Hannan, Linda Rautela, Marnie Graco, Jennifer Jones, Sarah Retica, Krisha Saravanan, Nicola Burgess, Rebekah McGaw, Ashleigh Donovan, Talia Clohessy, Caroline Chao, Cameron Charles, Mark E Howard, David J Berlowitz",2024

[A case of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis managed by tracheostomy and invasive ventilation in which air leaks occurred at the cuff].,"The patient was a 64-year-old woman who had been diagnosed with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis 8 years ago, and had been under artificial ventilation with tracheotomy for 6 years. Computed tomography indicated a dilated tracheal diameter of 29.6 ‍mm at the cuff, and a high cuff pressure of 80 ‍cmH<sub>2</sub>O. An adjustable flange tracheostomy tube with an optional length setting was used to extend the effective length by 28 ‍mm. A previously evident air leak disappeared with the change in cuff level, and cuff pressure decreased to 25 ‍cmH<sub>2</sub>O. X-ray images indicated a reduction in the size of the previous cuff area. Tracheal dilatation due to improper management of cuff pressure is a contributing factor to air leakage at the cuff area, and using an adjustable flange tracheostomy tube in an effort to resolve such air leaks is a valid option.","Nobuhiko Shibasaki, Kaoru Konishi, Yutaka Nishiyama, Tetsuo Miyagawa, Takaya Numayama",2024
Microvascular abnormalities in skin capillaries of individuals with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.,"This is the first study aimed to detect morphological abnormalities in vivo in the skin capillaries of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis patients (ALS). Videocapillaroscopy assessed subungueal capillaries in 28 ALS patients (cases) and 35 controls (p = 0.42). The mean age was 61.46 and 61.23 years, respectively (p > 0.99). No statistically significant differences were observed between the groups regarding dominant hand, arterial hypertension, dyslipidemia, diabetes mellitus, active smoker, and former smoker variables. 78.57% of cases had spinal onset and 21.43% bulbar. The median disease duration (time between the onset of symptoms and the date of videocapillarscopy) was 29.71 months. Dilated capillaries were detected in 17.8% of cases and 11.43% of controls (p = 0.49). The median of capillary diameter in cases was 10.15 µm and 8.72 µm in controls (p = 0.011). 35.71% of cases and 2.86% of controls had severe capillary tortuosities (p < 0.001). Ramified capillaries were observed in 46.43% of cases and 11.43% of controls (p < 0.002). Micro-hemorrhages were only observed in 10.71% of cases. No significant correlations were observed between disease duration and dilated capillaries, tortuosity, ramified capillaries, and micro-hemorrhages. The present in vivo study shows abnormalities in the skin capillaries of ALS patients that do not depend on disease duration.","Abdelilah Assialioui, Carla Marco-Pascual, Vicenç Torrente-Segarra, Raul Domínguez, Naiara Santos, Judith Peñafiel, Xavier Juanola, Mónica Povedano, Isidro Ferrer",2024
[Research progress on Pb-induced neurotoxicity through glial cells].,"Lead is one of the most important occupational hazards in China, and occupational exposure is the leading cause of lead poisoning. Lead can be absorbed by the body through air, food, drinking water and skin, and accumulate in multiple organs in the body, posing health risks to humans, especially to lead workers. Many previous studies have shown that lead can affect the function of glial cells such as microglia, astrocytes and oligodendrocytes, resulting in irreversible neurological damage. This article provides an overview of the neurotoxic mechanism induced by lead through glial cells, elucidates that lead can induce neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, and reviews the relationship between lead and glial cells, in order to provide reference for further research on the neurotoxic mechanism of lead on glial cells.","N Luo, J Wang, Z Y Zhang, X Y Zhao, R R Huang, Q Y Wu",2024
Severe dynein dysfunction in cholinergic neurons exacerbates ALS-like phenotypes in a new mouse model.,"Cytoplasmic dynein 1, a motor protein essential for retrograde axonal transport, is increasingly implicated in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). In this study, we developed a novel mouse model that combines the Legs at odd angles (Loa, F580Y) point mutation in the dynein heavy chain with a cholinergic neuron-specific knockout of the dynein heavy chain. This model, for the first time, allows us to investigate the impact of Loa allele exclusivity in these neurons into adulthood. Our findings reveal that this selective increase in dynein dysfunction exacerbated the phenotypes observed in heterozygous Loa mice including pre-wean survival, reduced body weight and grip strength. Additionally, it induced ALS-like pathology in neuromuscular junctions (NMJs) not seen in heterozygous Loa mice. Notably, we also found a previously unobserved significant increase in neurons displaying TDP-43 puncta in both Loa mutants, suggesting early TDP-43 mislocalisation - a hallmark of ALS. The novel model also exhibited a concurrent rise in p62 puncta that did not co-localise with TDP-43, indicating broader impairments in autophagic clearance mechanisms. Overall, this new model underscores the fact that dynein impairment alone can induce ALS-like pathology and provides a valuable platform to further explore the role of dynein in ALS.","Fabio A Simoes, Eleni Christoforidou, Raphaelle Cassel, Luc Dupuis, Majid Hafezparast",2024

A hydrophobic core stabilizes the residual structure in the RRM2 intermediate state of the ALS-linked protein TDP-43.,"Folding intermediates mediate both protein folding and the misfolding and aggregation observed in human diseases, including amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), and are prime targets for therapeutic interventions. In this study, we identified the core nucleus of structure for a folding intermediate in the second RNA recognition motif (RRM2) of the ALS-linked RNA-binding protein, TDP-43, using a combination of experimental and computational approaches. Urea equilibrium unfolding studies revealed that the RRM2 intermediate state consists of collapsed residual secondary structure localized to the N-terminal half of RRM2, while the C-terminus is largely disordered. Steered molecular dynamics simulations and mutagenesis studies yielded key stabilizing hydrophobic contacts that, when mutated to alanine, severely disrupt the overall fold of RRM2. In combination, these findings suggest a role for this RRM intermediate in normal TDP-43 function as well as serving as a template for misfolding and aggregation through the low stability and non-native secondary structure.","Brian C Mackness, Brittany R Morgan, Laura M Deveau, Sagar V Kathuria, Jill A Zitzewitz, Francesca Massi",2024

TDP43 aggregation at ER-exit sites impairs ER-to-Golgi transport.,"Protein aggregation plays key roles in age-related degenerative diseases, but how different proteins coalesce to form inclusions that vary in composition, morphology, molecular dynamics and confer physiological consequences is poorly understood. Here we employ a general reporter based on mutant Hsp104 to identify proteins forming aggregates in human cells under common proteotoxic stress. We identify over 300 proteins that form different inclusions containing subsets of aggregating proteins. In particular, TDP43, implicated in Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS), partitions dynamically between two distinct types of aggregates: stress granule and a previously unknown non-dynamic (solid-like) inclusion at the ER exit sites (ERES). TDP43-ERES co-aggregation is induced by diverse proteotoxic stresses and observed in the motor neurons of ALS patients. Such aggregation causes retention of secretory cargos at ERES and therefore delays ER-to-Golgi transport, providing a link between TDP43 aggregation and compromised cellular function in ALS patients.","Hongyi Wu, Loo Chien Wang, Belle M Sow, Damien Leow, Jin Zhu, Kathryn M Gallo, Kathleen Wilsbach, Roshni Gupta, Lyle W Ostrow, Crystal J J Yeo, Radoslaw M Sobota, Rong Li",2024

CNS disease associated with enhanced type I interferon signalling.,"The ability to mount an interferon-mediated innate immune response is essential in protection against neurotropic viruses, but antiviral type I interferons also have neurotoxic potential. The production of type I interferons can be triggered by self-derived nucleic acids, and the brain can be susceptible to inappropriate upregulation of type I interferon signalling. Homoeostatic dysregulation of type I interferons has been implicated in rare inborn errors of immunity (referred to as type I interferonopathies) and more common neurodegenerative disorders (eg, Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis). Recent developments include new insights into the pathogenesis of these disorders that involve dysregulated type I interferon signalling, as well as advances in their diagnosis and management. The role of type I interferons in brain cellular health suggests the future therapeutic potential of approaches that target these interferons and their signalling.",Yanick J Crow,2024

The Role of Sirtuin 1 in Ageing and Neurodegenerative Disease: A Molecular Perspective.,"Sirtuin 1 (SIRT1), an NAD+-dependent deacetylase, has emerged as a key regulator of cellular processes linked to ageing and neurodegeneration. SIRT1 modulates various signalling pathways, including those involved in autophagy, oxidative stress, and mitochondrial function, which are critical in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases. This review explores the therapeutic potential of SIRT1 in several neurodegenerative disorders, including Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), Huntington's disease (HD), and Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS). Preclinical studies have demonstrated that SIRT1 activators, such as resveratrol, SRT1720, and SRT2104, can alleviate disease symptoms by reducing oxidative stress, enhancing autophagic flux, and promoting neuronal survival. Ongoing clinical trials are evaluating the efficacy of these SIRT1 activators, providing hope for future therapeutic strategies targeting SIRT1 in neurodegenerative diseases. This review explores the role of SIRT1 in ageing and neurodegenerative diseases, with a particular focus on its molecular mechanisms, therapeutic potential, and clinical applications.","Riya Thapa, Ehssan Moglad, Muhammad Afzal, Gaurav Kumar, Asif Ahmad Bhat, Waleed Hassan Almalki, Imran Kazmi, Sami I Alzarea, Kumud Pant, Thakur Gurjeet Singh, Sachin Kumar Singh, Haider Ali",2024
