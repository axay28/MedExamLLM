Loss of CLN3 in microglia leads to impaired lipid metabolism and myelin turnover.,"Loss-of-function mutations in CLN3 cause juvenile Batten disease, featuring neurodegeneration and early-stage neuroinflammation. How loss of CLN3 function leads to early neuroinflammation is not yet understood. Here, we have comprehensively studied microglia from Cln3<sup>∆ex7/8</sup> mice, a genetically accurate disease model. Loss of CLN3 function in microglia leads to lysosomal storage material accumulation and abnormal morphology of subcellular organelles. Moreover, pathological proteomic signatures are indicative of defects in lysosomal function and abnormal lipid metabolism. Consistent with these findings, CLN3-deficient microglia are unable to efficiently turnover myelin and metabolize the associated lipids, showing defects in lipid droplet formation and cholesterol accumulation. Accordingly, we also observe impaired myelin integrity in aged Cln3<sup>∆ex7/8</sup> mouse brain. Autophagy inducers and cholesterol-lowering drugs correct the observed microglial phenotypes. Taken together, these data implicate a cell-autonomous defect in CLN3-deficient microglia that impacts their ability to support neuronal cell health, suggesting microglial targeted therapies should be considered for CLN3 disease.","Seda Yasa, Elisabeth S Butz, Alessio Colombo, Uma Chandrachud, Luca Montore, Sarah Tschirner, Matthias Prestel, Steven D Sheridan, Stephan A Müller, Janos Groh, Stefan F Lichtenthaler, Sabina Tahirovic, Susan L Cotman",2024
CLN3 transcript complexity revealed by long-read RNA sequencing analysis.,"Batten disease is a group of rare inherited neurodegenerative diseases. Juvenile CLN3 disease is the most prevalent type, and the most common pathogenic variant shared by most patients is the ""1-kb"" deletion which removes two internal coding exons (7 and 8) in CLN3. Previously, we identified two transcripts in patient fibroblasts homozygous for the 1-kb deletion: the 'major' and 'minor' transcripts. To understand the full variety of disease transcripts and their role in disease pathogenesis, it is necessary to first investigate CLN3 transcription in ""healthy"" samples without juvenile CLN3 disease.","Hao-Yu Zhang, Christopher Minnis, Emil Gustavsson, Mina Ryten, Sara E Mole",2024
Wide-field OCT angiography for non-human primate retinal imaging.,"Optical coherence tomography (OCT) is a well-established research tool for vision research in animal models capable of providing <i>in vivo</i> imaging of the retina. Structural OCT can be enhanced using OCT angiography (OCTA) processing in order to provide simultaneously acquired, automatically co-registered vascular information. Currently available OCT. Currently available OCTA lack either large field of view or high resolution. In this study we developed a wide-field (60-degree), high-resolution (10.5-µm optical transverse) and high-sensitivity (104-dB) OCTA-enabled system for non-human primate imaging and with it imaged multiple disease models, including models of age-related macular degeneration (AMD), Bardet-Biedl Syndrome (BBS), and the <i>CLN7</i> variant of Batten disease. We demonstrate clear visualization of features including drusen, ellipsoid zone loss, vascular retinopathy, and retinal thinning in these eyes.","Xiang Wei, Tristan T Hormel, Laurie Renner, Martha Neuringer, Yali Jia",2024
Behaviours and psychological symptoms of childhood dementia: two cases of psychosocial interventions.,"Childhood dementias are a group of rare, fatal neurodegenerative disorders, characterised by global cognitive decline, loss of previously acquired developmental skills and behaviours and psychological symptoms of dementia (BPSD). Batten disease, or neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis, and Sanfilippo syndrome, or mucopolysaccharidosis type III, are two of the more common forms of childhood dementia disorders worldwide. While psychosocial interventions are the best available therapeutic approach for BPSD management in adult-onset dementia, there is very limited literature or clinical experience in the context of childhood dementia. To address this gap, we conducted a descriptive case analysis of BPSD profiles, associated contributing factors and targeted psychosocial interventions in two cases with childhood dementia disorders (Sanfilippo syndrome and CLN3 (juvenile onset) Batten disease) who were referred to Dementia Support Australia, a national dementia behaviour support service in Australia. Primary BPSD identified in these disorders included physical and verbal aggression and irritability/lability. In these cases, contributing factors to the development of BPSD were not monolithic, encompassing pain, caregiver's approach and over or under-stimulation. Improvement in BPSD were observed using the Neuropsychiatric Inventory-Quesionnaire and globally noted as per the qualitative feedback reported by family and caregivers. Person-centred, multimodal psychosocial interventions were recognised as effective therapies in resolving BPSD in these cases. In conclusion, the case studies described the nature and presentation of BPSD in two common forms of childhood dementia and demonstrated the potential benefits of person-centred psychosocial interventions (delivered through national dementia-specific support programs) in alleviating BPSD such as irritability and aggression in these disorders.","Mustafa Atee, Ineka Whiteman, Rebecca Lloyd, Thomas Morris",2024
"Reduction of neuroinflammation and seizures in a mouse model of CLN1 batten disease using the small molecule enzyme mimetic, N-Tert-butyl hydroxylamine.","Infantile neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis (CLN1 Batten Disease) is a devastating pediatric lysosomal storage disease caused by pathogenic variants in the CLN1 gene, which encodes the depalmitoylation enzyme, palmitoyl-protein thioesterase 1 (PPT1). CLN1 patients present with visual deterioration, psychomotor dysfunction, and recurrent seizures until neurodegeneration results in death, typically before fifteen years of age. Histopathological features of CLN1 include aggregation of lysosomal autofluorescent storage material (AFSM), as well as profound gliosis. The current management of CLN1 is relegated to palliative care. Here, we examine the therapeutic potential of a small molecule PPT1 mimetic, N-tert-butyl hydroxylamine (NtBuHA), in a Cln1<sup>-/-</sup> mouse model. Treatment with NtBuHA reduced AFSM accumulation both in vitro and in vivo. Importantly, NtBuHA treatment in Cln1<sup>-/-</sup> mice reduced neuroinflammation, mitigated epileptic episodes, and normalized motor function. Live cell imaging of Cln1<sup>-/-</sup> primary cortical neurons treated with NtBuHA partially rescued aberrant synaptic calcium dynamics, suggesting a potential mechanism contributing to the therapeutic effects of NtBuHA in vivo. Taken together, our findings provide supporting evidence for NtBuHA as a potential treatment for CLN1 Batten Disease.","Zach Fyke, Rachel Johansson, Anna I Scott, Devin Wiley, Daniel Chelsky, Joseph D Zak, Nader Al Nakouzi, Kevin P Koster, Akira Yoshii",2024

Mechanisms of Action of the US Food and Drug Administration-Approved Antisense Oligonucleotide Drugs.,"Antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs) are single stranded nucleic acids that target RNA. The US Food and Drug Administration has approved ASOs for several diseases. ASOs utilize three principal modes of action (MOA). The first MOA is initiated by base-pairing between the ASO and its target mRNA, followed by RNase H-dependent mRNA degradation. The second MOA is triggered by ASOs that occlude splice acceptor sites in pre-mRNAs leading to skipping of a mutation-bearing exon. The third MOA involves ASOs that sterically hinder mRNA function, often inhibiting translation. ASOs contain a variety of modifications to the sugar-phosphate backbone and bases that stabilize the ASO or render them resistant to RNase activity. RNase H-dependent ASOs include inotersen and eplontersen (for hereditary transthyretin amyloidosis), fomiversen (for opportunistic cytomegalovirus infection), mipomersen (for familial hypercholesterolemia), and tofersen [for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS)]. Splice modulating ASOs include nursinersen (for spinal muscular atrophy) and eteplirsen, golodirsen, viltolarsen, and casimersen (all for the treatment of Duchenne muscular dystrophy). In addition, a designer ASO, milasen, was used to treat a single individual afflicted with Batten disease. Since ASO design relies principally upon knowledge of mRNA sequence, the bench to bedside pipeline for ASOs is expedient compared with protein-directed drugs. [Graphical abstract available.].","Angela Sang, Selena Zhuo, Adara Bochanis, José E Manautou, Raman Bahal, Xiao-Bo Zhong, Theodore P Rasmussen",2024
Genetic and cellular basis of impaired phagocytosis and photoreceptor degeneration in CLN3 disease.,"CLN3 Batten disease (also known as Juvenile Neuronal Ceroid Lipofuscinosis; JNCL) is a lysosomal storage disorder that typically initiates with retinal degeneration but is followed by seizure onset, motor decline and premature death. Patient-derived CLN3 disease iPSC-RPE cells show defective phagocytosis of photoreceptor outer segments (POSs). Because modifier genes are implicated in CLN3 disease, our goal here was to investigate a direct link between <i>CLN3</i> mutation and POS phagocytosis defect.","Jimin Han, Sueanne Chear, Jana Talbot, Vicki Swier, Clarissa Booth, Cheyenne Reuben-Thomas, Sonal Dalvi, Jill M Weimer, Alex W Hewitt, Anthony L Cook, Ruchira Singh",2024
Loss of the lysosomal protein CLN3 modifies the lipid content of the nuclear envelope leading to DNA damage and activation of YAP1 pro-apoptotic signaling.,"Batten disease is characterized by early-onset blindness, juvenile dementia and death during the second decade of life. The most common genetic causes are mutations in the <i>CLN3</i> gene encoding a lysosomal protein. There are currently no therapies targeting the progression of the disease, mostly due to the lack of knowledge about the disease mechanisms. To gain insight into the impact of CLN3 loss on cellular signaling and organelle function, we generated CLN3 knock-out cells in a human cell line (CLN3-KO), and performed RNA sequencing to obtain the cellular transcriptome. Following a multi-dimensional transcriptome analysis, we identified the transcriptional regulator YAP1 as a major driver of the transcriptional changes observed in CLN3-KO cells. We further observed that YAP1 pro-apoptotic signaling is hyperactive as a consequence of CLN3 functional loss in retinal pigment epithelia cells, and in the hippocampus and thalamus of CLN3<sup>exΔ7/8</sup> mice, an established model of Batten disease. Loss of CLN3 activates YAP1 by a cascade of events that starts with the inability of releasing glycerophosphodiesthers from CLN3-KO lysosomes, which leads to perturbations in the lipid content of the nuclear envelope and nuclear dysmorphism. This results in increased number of DNA lesions, activating the kinase c-Abl, which phosphorylates YAP1, stimulating its pro-apoptotic signaling. Altogether, our results highlight a novel organelle crosstalk paradigm in which lysosomal metabolites regulate nuclear envelope content, nuclear shape and DNA homeostasis. This novel molecular mechanism underlying the loss of CLN3 in mammalian cells and tissues may open new c-Abl-centric therapeutic strategies to target Batten disease.","Neuza Domingues, Alessia Calcagni', Joana Pires, Sofia Roque Freire, Niculin Joachim Herz, Tuong Huynh, Katarzyna Wieciorek, Maria João Moreno, Tiago Fleming Outeiro, Henrique Girão, Ira Milosevic, Andrea Ballabio, Nuno Raimundo",2024
Intragenic MFSD8 duplication and histopathological findings in a rabbit with neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis.,"Neuronal ceroid lipofuscinoses (NCL) are among the most prevalent neurodegenerative disorders of early life in humans. Disease-causing variants have been described for 13 different NCL genes. In this study, a refined pathological characterization of a female rabbit with progressive neurological signs reminiscent of NCL was performed. Cytoplasmic pigment present in neurons was weakly positive with Sudan black B and autofluorescent. Immunohistology revealed astrogliosis, microgliosis and axonal degeneration. During the subsequent genetic investigation, the genome of the affected rabbit was sequenced and examined for private variants in NCL candidate genes. The analysis revealed a homozygous ~10.7 kb genomic duplication on chromosome 15 comprising parts of the MFSD8 gene, NC_013683.1:g.103,727,963_103,738,667dup. The duplication harbors two internal protein coding exons and is predicted to introduce a premature stop codon into the transcript, truncating ~50% of the wild-type MFSD8 open reading frame encoding the major facilitator superfamily domain containing protein 8, XP_002717309.2:p.(Glu235Leufs*23). Biallelic loss-of-function variants in MFSD8 have been described to cause NCL7 in human patients, dogs and a single cat. The available clinical and pathological data, together with current knowledge about MFSD8 variants and their functional impact in other species, point to the MFSD8 duplication as a likely causative defect for the observed phenotype in the affected rabbit.","Matthias Christen, Katharina M Gregor, Ariane Böttcher-Künneke, Mara S Lombardo, Wolfgang Baumgärtner, Vidhya Jagannathan, Christina Puff, Tosso Leeb",2024

A recessive <i>CLN3</i> variant is responsible for delayed-onset retinal degeneration in Hereford cattle.,"Thirteen American Hereford cattle were reported blind with presumed onset when ~12-mo-old. All blind cattle shared a common ancestor through both the maternal and paternal pedigrees, suggesting a recessive genetic origin. Given the pedigree relationships and novel phenotype, we characterized the ophthalmo-pathologic changes associated with blindness and identified the responsible gene variant. Ophthalmologic examinations of 5 blind cattle revealed retinal degeneration. Histologically, 2 blind cattle had loss of the retinal photoreceptor layer. Whole-genome sequencing (WGS) of 7 blind cattle and 9 unaffected relatives revealed a 1-bp frameshift deletion in ceroid lipofuscinosis neuronal 3 (<i>CLN3</i>; chr25 g.26043843del) for which the blind cattle were homozygous and their parents heterozygous. The identified variant in exon 16 of 17 is predicted to truncate the encoded protein (p. Pro369Argfs*8) battenin, which is involved in lysosomal function necessary for photoreceptor layer maintenance. Of 462 cattle genotyped, only blind cattle were homozygous for the deletion. A query of WGS data of > 5,800 animals further revealed that the variant was only observed in related Hereford cattle. Mutations in <i>CLN3</i> are associated with human juvenile neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis (JNCL), or Batten disease, which results in early-onset retinal degeneration and lesions similar to those observed in our cases. Our data support the frameshift variant of <i>CLN3</i> as causative of blindness in these Hereford cattle, and provide additional evidence of the role of this gene in retinal lesions, possibly as a model for human non-syndromic JNCL.","Rachel R Reith, Mackenzie C Batt, Anna M Fuller, Jessica M Meekins, Kathryn A Diehl, You Zhou, Patrick S Bedwell, Jack A Ward, Stacy K Sanders, Jessica L Petersen, David J Steffen",2024
The parent and family impact of CLN3 disease: an observational survey-based study.,"CLN3 disease (also known as CLN3 Batten disease or Juvenile Neuronal Ceroid Lipofuscinosis) is a rare pediatric neurodegenerative disorder caused by biallelic mutations in CLN3. While extensive efforts have been undertaken to understand CLN3 disease etiology, pathology, and clinical progression, little is known about the impact of CLN3 disease on parents and caregivers. Here, we investigated CLN3 disease progression, clinical care, and family experiences using semi-structured interviews with 39 parents of individuals with CLN3 disease. Analysis included response categorization by independent observers and quantitative methods.","Angela Schulz, Nita Patel, Jon J Brudvig, Frank Stehr, Jill M Weimer, Erika F Augustine",2024
Identification of New Modulators and Inhibitors of Palmitoyl-Protein Thioesterase 1 for CLN1 Batten Disease and Cancer.,"Palmitoyl-protein thioesterase 1 (PPT1) is an understudied enzyme that is gaining attention due to its role in the depalmitoylation of several proteins involved in neurodegenerative diseases and cancer. PPT1 is overexpressed in several cancers, specifically cholangiocarcinoma and esophageal cancers. Inhibitors of PPT1 lead to cell death and have been shown to enhance the killing of tumor cells alongside known chemotherapeutics. PPT1 is hence a viable target for anticancer drug development. Furthermore, mutations in PPT1 cause a lysosomal storage disorder called infantile neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis (CLN1 disease). Molecules that can inhibit, stabilize, or modulate the activity of this target are needed to address these diseases. We used PPT1 enzymatic assays to identify molecules that were subsequently tested by using differential scanning fluorimetry and microscale thermophoresis. Selected compounds were also tested in neuroblastoma cell lines. The resulting PPT1 screening data was used for building machine learning models to help select additional compounds for testing. We discovered two of the most potent PPT1 inhibitors reported to date, orlistat (IC<sub>50</sub> 178.8 nM) and palmostatin B (IC<sub>50</sub> 11.8 nM). When tested in HepG2 cells, it was found that these molecules had decreased activity, indicating that they were likely not penetrating the cells. The combination of in vitro enzymatic and biophysical assays enabled the identification of several molecules that can bind or inhibit PPT1 and may aid in the discovery of modulators or chaperones. The molecules identified could be used as a starting point for further optimization as treatments for other potential therapeutic applications outside CLN1 disease, such as cancer and neurological diseases.","Ana C Puhl, Renuka Raman, Tammy M Havener, Eni Minerali, Anthony J Hickey, Sean Ekins",2024

Glycerophosphodiesters inhibit lysosomal phospholipid catabolism in Batten disease.,"Batten disease, the most prevalent form of neurodegeneration in children, is caused by mutations in the CLN3 gene, which encodes a lysosomal transmembrane protein. CLN3 loss leads to significant accumulation of glycerophosphodiesters (GPDs), the end products of glycerophospholipid catabolism in the lysosome. Despite GPD storage being robustly observed upon CLN3 loss, the role of GPDs in neuropathology remains unclear. Here, we demonstrate that GPDs act as potent inhibitors of glycerophospholipid catabolism in the lysosome using human cell lines and mouse models. Mechanistically, GPDs bind and competitively inhibit the lysosomal phospholipases PLA2G15 and PLBD2, which we establish to possess phospholipase B activity. GPDs effectively inhibit the rate-limiting lysophospholipase activity of these phospholipases. Consistently, lysosomes of CLN3-deficient cells and tissues accumulate toxic lysophospholipids. Our work establishes that the storage material in Batten disease directly disrupts lysosomal lipid homeostasis, suggesting GPD clearance as a potential therapeutic approach to this fatal disease.","Kwamina Nyame, Andy Hims, Aya Aburous, Nouf N Laqtom, Wentao Dong, Uche N Medoh, Julia C Heiby, Jian Xiong, Alessandro Ori, Monther Abu-Remaileh",2024
The Psychiatric Care of Children and Young Adults With Neurodegenerative Diseases.,"Pediatric neurodegenerative disorders (PNDs), such as juvenile neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis (CLN3 disease, also called Batten disease) and juvenile Huntington disease, are devastating conditions that result in progressive neurological dysfunction and profound medical comorbidities leading to early mortality in children and young adults.<sup>1</sup> There are more than 70 PNDs, with a combined estimated prevalence of ∼0.1 in 1,000 live births.<sup>2,3</sup> Individuals with PNDs commonly experience complex neuropsychiatric manifestations such as neurocognitive symptoms (dementia), irritability, aggression and self-injury, mood disorders, sensory alterations, and psychosis.

Mechanisms regulating the intracellular trafficking and release of CLN5 and CTSD.,"Ceroid lipofuscinosis neuronal 5 (CLN5) and cathepsin D (CTSD) are soluble lysosomal enzymes that also localize extracellularly. In humans, homozygous mutations in CLN5 and CTSD cause CLN5 disease and CLN10 disease, respectively, which are two subtypes of neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis (commonly known as Batten disease). The mechanisms regulating the intracellular trafficking of CLN5 and CTSD and their release from cells are not well understood. Here, we used the social amoeba Dictyostelium discoideum as a model system to examine the pathways and cellular components that regulate the intracellular trafficking and release of the D. discoideum homologs of human CLN5 (Cln5) and CTSD (CtsD). We show that both Cln5 and CtsD contain signal peptides for secretion that facilitate their release from cells. Like Cln5, extracellular CtsD is glycosylated. In addition, Cln5 release is regulated by the amount of extracellular CtsD. Autophagy induction promotes the release of Cln5, and to a lesser extent CtsD. Release of Cln5 requires the autophagy proteins Atg1, Atg5, and Atg9, as well as autophagosomal-lysosomal fusion. Atg1 and Atg5 are required for the release of CtsD. Together, these data support a model where Cln5 and CtsD are actively released from cells via their signal peptides for secretion and pathways linked to autophagy. The release of Cln5 and CtsD from cells also requires microfilaments and the D. discoideum homologs of human AP-3 complex mu subunit, the lysosomal-trafficking regulator LYST, mucopilin-1, and the Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome-associated protein WASH, which all regulate lysosomal exocytosis in this model organism. These findings suggest that lysosomal exocytosis also facilitates the release of Cln5 and CtsD from cells. In addition, we report the roles of ABC transporters, microtubules, osmotic stress, and the putative D. discoideum homologs of human sortilin and cation-independent mannose-6-phosphate receptor in regulating the intracellular/extracellular distribution of Cln5 and CtsD. In total, this study identifies the cellular mechanisms regulating the release of Cln5 and CtsD from D. discoideum cells and provides insight into how altered trafficking of CLN5 and CTSD causes disease in humans.","Robert J Huber, William D Kim, Morgan L D M Wilson-Smillie",2024
Optical coherence tomography in children with inherited retinal disease.,"Recent advances have led to therapeutic options becoming available for people with inherited retinal disease. In particular, gene therapy has been shown to hold great promise for slowing vision loss from inherited retinal disease. Recent studies suggest that gene therapy is likely to be most effective when implemented early in the disease process, making consideration of paediatric populations important. It is therefore necessary to have a comprehensive understanding of retinal imaging in children with inherited retinal diseases, in order to monitor disease progression and to determine which early retinal biomarkers may be used as outcome measures in future clinical trials. In addition, as many optometrists will review children with an inherited retinal disease, an understanding of the expected imaging outcomes can improve clinical care. This review focuses on the most common imaging modality used in research assessment of paediatric inherited retinal diseases: optical coherence tomography. Optical coherence tomography findings can be used in both the clinical and research setting. In particular, the review discusses current knowledge of optical coherence tomography findings in eight paediatric inherited retinal diseases - Stargardt disease, Bests disease, Leber's congenital amaurosis, choroideremia, RPGR related retinitis pigmentosa, Usher syndrome, X-linked retinoschisis and, Batten disease.","Jasleen K Jolly, Brent M Rodda, Thomas L Edwards, Lauren N Ayton, Jonathan B Ruddle",2024
Splice-Modulating Antisense Oligonucleotides as Therapeutics for Inherited Metabolic Diseases.,"The last decade (2013-2023) has seen unprecedented successes in the clinical translation of therapeutic antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs). Eight such molecules have been granted marketing approval by the United States Food and Drug Administration (US FDA) during the decade, after the first ASO drug, fomivirsen, was approved much earlier, in 1998. Splice-modulating ASOs have also been developed for the therapy of inborn errors of metabolism (IEMs), due to their ability to redirect aberrant splicing caused by mutations, thus recovering the expression of normal transcripts, and correcting the deficiency of functional proteins. The feasibility of treating IEM patients with splice-switching ASOs has been supported by FDA permission (2018) of the first ""N-of-1"" study of milasen, an investigational ASO drug for Batten disease. Although for IEM, owing to the rarity of individual disease and/or pathogenic mutation, only a low number of patients may be treated by ASOs that specifically suppress the aberrant splicing pattern of mutant precursor mRNA (pre-mRNA), splice-switching ASOs represent superior individualized molecular therapeutics for IEM. In this work, we first summarize the ASO technology with respect to its mechanisms of action, chemical modifications of nucleotides, and rational design of modified oligonucleotides; following that, we precisely provide a review of the current understanding of developing splice-modulating ASO-based therapeutics for IEM. In the concluding section, we suggest potential ways to improve and/or optimize the development of ASOs targeting IEM.","Suxiang Chen, Saumya Nishanga Heendeniya, Bao T Le, Kamal Rahimizadeh, Navid Rabiee, Qurat Ul Ain Zahra, Rakesh N Veedu",2024

CLN3 deficiency leads to neurological and metabolic perturbations during early development.,"Juvenile neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis (or Batten disease) is an autosomal recessive, rare neurodegenerative disorder that affects mainly children above the age of 5 yr and is most commonly caused by mutations in the highly conserved <i>CLN3</i> gene. Here, we generated <i>cln3</i> morphants and stable mutant lines in zebrafish. Although neither morphant nor mutant <i>cln3</i> larvae showed any obvious developmental or morphological defects, behavioral phenotyping of the mutant larvae revealed hyposensitivity to abrupt light changes and hypersensitivity to pro-convulsive drugs. Importantly, in-depth metabolomics and lipidomics analyses revealed significant accumulation of several glycerophosphodiesters (GPDs) and cholesteryl esters, and a global decrease in bis(monoacylglycero)phosphate species, two of which (GPDs and bis(monoacylglycero)phosphates) were previously proposed as potential biomarkers for <i>CLN3</i> disease based on independent studies in other organisms.
