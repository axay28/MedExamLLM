High rate of macrolide resistance and closely genetically related <i>Mycobacterium abscessus</i> complex strains identified among both cystic fibrosis and non-cystic fibrosis patients within two countries.,"<i>Mycobacterium abscessus</i> is an emerging opportunistic pathogen affecting patients with chronic lung diseases, primarily cystic fibrosis (CF), or those under immunosuppression. Hence, investigations into the epidemiology and transmission of <i>M. abscessus</i> and accurate antibiotic susceptibility data are essential for the effective treatment of infections caused by this pathogen. This retrospective nationwide study included all clinical <i>M. abscessus</i> isolates (<i>n</i> = 59) from 29 patients diagnosed in the Czech Republic and Slovakia between 2018 and 2023. Whole genome sequencing (WGS) was performed to identify clusters and classify isolates into predominant circulating clones (DCC). Subspecies identification of unique isolates showed subspecies <i>abscessus</i> as the most prevalent (69.0%). The results of drug-susceptibility testing showed that 65.5% of all isolates were resistant to at least three antibiotics tested. CF patients under 24 years of age were the most at-risk group for <i>M. abscessus</i> infection. WGS identified seven clusters (including two cross-border) comprising CF and non-CF patients with a total clustering rate of 48.3%. One cluster involved patients infected with subspecies <i>massiliense</i> strains differing by 0 single nucleotide polymorphisms hospitalized in the same center. Furthermore, we identified representatives of all major DCCs. This study revealed predominant <i>Mycobacterium abscessus</i> complex clones circulating in the Czech Republic and Slovakia. The results show the high discriminatory power of WGS in the molecular epidemiology of <i>M. abscessus</i> and provide supporting evidence of direct or indirect cross-transmission of subspecies <i>massiliense</i> among both CF and non-CF patients.","Matúš Dohál, Věra Dvořáková, Michaela Hromádková, Martina Pinková, Jana Amlerová, Marek Schwarz, Andrea Spitaleri, Federico di Marco, Jarmila Hnilicová, Eduard Gondáš, Michael E Rasmussen, Igor Porvazník, Ivan Solovič, Daniela M Cirillo, Juraj Mokrý",2024
Genomic and phenotypic characterization of <i>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</i> isolates from two Mexican cystic fibrosis attention centers.,"Thirty-nine clinical isolates of <i>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</i> collected from 11 cystic fibrosis (CF) patients at two CF attention centers over 10 years were subjected to whole genome sequencing (WGS). Phenotypic tests (i.e., elastase, motility, biofilm, growth rate, and antibiotic susceptibility) were performed to correlate results. A single strain of <i>P. aeruginosa</i> was found to persist over time in longitudinal isolates. No transmission between patients or centers was observed. A tendency to lack genes related to pyoverdine, flagellum, pili, and O-antigen was observed, whereas those related to biofilm, phenazine, and pyochelin were conserved among isolates. In a patient with a 10-year follow-up, a single strain of <i>P. aeruginosa</i> persisted and showed a gradual decrease in elastase activity and growth rate, demonstrating an adaptive phenotype.<b>IMPORTANCE</b>This study investigates the genomic and phenotypic characteristics of <i>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</i> isolates from Mexican cystic fibrosis (CF) patients, an underrepresented group in CF research. To our knowledge, it is the first to use whole genome sequencing (WGS) to study longitudinally collected <i>P. aeruginosa</i> isolates from this population, evaluating both genomic features and clonal relationships. Remarkably, the study includes samples from one patient over 10 years, offering an extended observation time compared to existing literature. Unlike similar studies, which often lack phenotypic testing, this research incorporates various virulence-related phenotypic assays, enhancing our understanding of gene-to-phenotype correlations. Two potential mechanisms for the loss of elastolytic activity were identified. Furthermore, we conduct an in-depth mobilome analysis, an area that remains largely unexplored in CF contexts. Whole genome sequencing data are publicly available through the NCBI SRA database, facilitating further re-analysis for studies on <i>P. aeruginosa</i> in CF, as well as epidemiological and population structure research.","Luis Ángel Núñez-García, José Manuel Feliciano-Guzmán, Christian Daniel Mireles-Davalos, José Raúl López-Sántiz, Jesús Elías Ovando-Fonseca, Eduardo Becerril-Vargas, María Elena Jiménez-Martínez, Nadia Rodríguez-Medina, Ulises Garza-Ramos, Carlos Córdova-Fletes, Elvira Garza-González",2024
Effectiveness of Telemedicine in Managing Health-Related Issues in the Pediatric Population: A Systematic Review.,"Healthcare delivery is made more convenient and effective via telemedicine, which enables physicians to conduct virtual consultations and evaluations with pediatric patients. The purpose of this systematic review was to evaluate the efficacy of telemedicine as compared to physical appointments in the pediatric population. We used Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines to search for the available literature using pre-specified inclusion and exclusion criteria. These databases provided 968 relevant research articles, which Endnote software screened for duplicates. Fourteen studies were considered relevant for full-text evaluation. After complete text evaluation, only 11 of these articles were found to be relevant. The Newcastle-Ottawa Scale (NOS) was used for the risk of bias assessment of all included studies. Eleven articles in all satisfied the requirements for inclusion and were added to the review. Every study was classified as either a cluster randomized trial (27%) or a randomized controlled trial (RCT) (73%). There were between 22 and 400 participants in each trial. Medical conditions evaluated included obesity (27%), mental health disorders (9%), asthma (18%), otitis media (9%), skin disorders (9%), type 1 diabetes (9%), attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) (9%), and pancreatic insufficiency associated with cystic fibrosis (1/11). Telemedicine strategies employed included telemedicine-based screening visits (9%), smartphone-based therapies (27%), phone counseling (18%), and videoconferencing visits between patients and doctors (45%). The outcomes of the telemedicine procedures in every included study were on par with or superior to those of the control groups. Medication adherence, appointment completion rates, life satisfaction, symptom management, and disease progression were all outcomes associated with these findings. Although more research is needed, the evidence from this review suggests that telemedicine services for the general public and pediatric care are comparable to or better than in-person services. Patients, healthcare professionals, and caregivers may benefit from using both telemedicine services and traditional in-person healthcare services. To maximize the potential of telemedicine, future research should focus on improving patients' access to care, increasing the cost-effectiveness of telemedicine services, and eliminating barriers to telemedicine use.","Iman Mohammed Taher Do Alfuqhar, Alaa Eldirdiri Ali Khalafalla, Salma Hassan Mahmoud Ali, Elwaleed Idrees Aydaross Adam, Hanady M Osman, Rwabi Safar Alrabie",2024
Current landscape of cystic fibrosis gene therapy.,"Cystic fibrosis is a life-threatening disease that is caused by mutations in <i>CFTR</i>, a gene which encodes an ion channel that supports proper function of several epithelial tissues, most critically the lung. Without CFTR, airway barrier mechanisms are impaired, allowing for chronic, recurrent infections that result in airway remodeling and deterioration of lung structure and function. Small molecule modulators can rescue existing, defective CFTR protein; however, they still leave a subset of people with CF with no current disease modifying treatments, aside from lung transplantation. Gene therapy directed to the lung is a promising strategy to modify CF disease in the organ most associated with morbidity and mortality. It is accomplished through delivery of a CFTR transgene with an airway permissive vector. Despite more than three decades of research in this area, a lung directed gene therapy has yet to be realized. There is hope that with improved delivery vectors, sufficient transduction of airway cells can achieve therapeutic levels of functional CFTR. In order to do this, preclinical programs need to meet a certain level of CFTR protein expression <i>in vitro</i> and <i>in vivo</i> through improved transduction, particularly in relevant airway cell types. Furthermore, clinical programs must be designed with sensitive methods to detect CFTR expression and function as well as methods to measure meaningful endpoints for lung structure, function and disease. Here, we discuss the current understanding of how much and where <i>CFTR</i> needs to be expressed, the most advanced vectors for <i>CFTR</i> delivery and clinical considerations for detecting CFTR protein and function in different patient subsets.","Lindsey W Plasschaert, Kelvin D MacDonald, Jeffrey S Moffit",2024

Gene expression responses of CF airway epithelial cells exposed to elexacaftor/tezacaftor/ivacaftor (ETI) suggest benefits beyond improved CFTR channel function.,"The combination of elexacaftor/tezacaftor/ivacaftor (ETI, Trikafta) reverses the primary defect in Cystic Fibrosis (CF) by improving CFTR mediated Cl<sup>-</sup> and HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> secretion by airway epithelial cells (AEC), leading to improved lung function and less frequent exacerbations and hospitalizations. However, studies have shown that CFTR modulators like ivacaftor, a component of ETI, has numerous effects on CF cells beyond improved CFTR channel function. Because little is known about the effect of ETI on CF AEC gene expression we exposed primary human AEC to ETI for 48 hours and interrogated the transcriptome by RNA-seq and qPCR. ETI increased CFTR Cl<sup>-</sup> secretion, and defensin gene expression (<i>DEFB1</i>) an observation consistent with reports of decreased bacterial burden in the lungs of people with CF (pwCF). ETI decreased <i>MMP10</i> and <i>MMP12</i> gene expression, suggesting that ETI may reduce proteolytic induced lung destruction in CF. ETI also reduced the expression of the stress response gene heme oxygenase (<i>HMOX1</i>). qPCR analysis confirmed <i>DEFB1</i>, <i>HMOX1</i>, <i>MMP10</i> and <i>MMP12</i> gene expression results observed by RNA-seq. Gene pathway analysis revealed that ETI decreased inflammatory signaling, cellular proliferation and MHC Class II antigen presentation. Collectively, these findings suggest that the clinical observation that ETI reduces lung infections in pwCF is related in part to drug induced increases in <i>DEFB1</i>, and that ETI may reduce lung damage by reducing <i>MMP10</i> and <i>MMP12</i> gene expression. Moreover, pathway analysis also identified several other genes responsible for the ETI induced reduction in inflammation observed in pwCF.","Thomas H Hampton, Roxanna Barnaby, Carolyn Roche, Amanda B Nymon, Kiyoshi Ferreira Fukutani, Todd A MacKenzie, Lily A Charpentier, Bruce A Stanton",2024
Multi-year comparison of VITEK MS performance for identification of rarely encountered pathogenic Gram-negative organisms (GNOs) in a large integrated Canadian healthcare region.,"This multi-year study (2014-2019) compared identification of rare and unusual Gram-negative organisms (GNOs) by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) (VITEK MS, bioMérieux, Laval Que.) to 16S rRNA gene sequencing (16S) according to our laboratories routine workflow; 16S is done if initial MALDI-TOF MS gave discordant, wrong, or no results. GNB isolates were first analyzed by standard phenotypic methods and MALDI-TOF MS using direct deposit-full formic acid extraction; proteomics was repeated if no result occurred. Medically approved 16S analyses were done using fast protocols. Isolate sequences were analyzed using the Integrated Database Network System (IDNS3) bacterial database (SmartGene, Lausanne, Switzerland). Three hundred thirty-one GNOs including 251 (76%) aerobic Gram-negative bacilli (GNB), 63 (19%) fastidious Gram-negative coccobacilli (fGNCBs), and 17 (5%) <i>Campylobacterales</i> (CAMPB) isolates were recovered from 304 specimens; >1 isolate was recovered from 19 (6%). GNOs were mainly recovered from blood cultures (31.6%) and lower respiratory specimens (43%) (one-half were isolated from cystic fibrosis patients). Accurate genus vs species identities were obtained for 67.7% and 32.5% aerobic GNBs, 73% and 60% fGNCBs, and 23.5% CAMPB (with no discrepant species), respectively. Wrong or no results were obtained for 81 (32.3%) aerobic GNBs, 17 (27%) fGNCBs, and 13 (72.2%) CAMPB. No results or misidentifications occurred for 33% of aerobic GNBs, 26% of fGNCBs, and 76.5% of CAMPB due to absence of species in the instrument's database. VITEK MS performance remained stable for aerobic GNBs and fGNCBs but improved for CAMPB with addition of <i>Campylobacter rectus</i> and <i>Campylobacter curvus</i> to the database. 16S remains important for identification of GNOs when proteomics fails.IMPORTANCEMatrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) has transformed the identification of commonly encountered Gram-negative organisms (GNOs) in the clinical laboratory, but rare and unusual organisms continue to challenge the technology. This study verified performance of VITEK MS for identification of a broad range of rare and unusual clinical GNO isolates by our large reference laboratory workflow over a multi-year period. Although most GNOs were accurately identified by MALDI-TOF MS, a small number of clinical isolates (~1%-6%) required 16S sequencing for identification depending on the GNO category. Approximately one-third of aerobic Gram-negative bacilli (GNBs) and two-thirds of <i>Campylobacterales</i> could not be accurately identified by proteomics due to lack of an organism in the instrument's database. MALDI-TOF MS databases should be continuously updated and validated, and laboratories should have a workflow for identification of unusual or rarely encountered aerobic, fastidious, and <i>Campylobacterales</i> GNOs that includes 16S rRNA gene sequencing whenever proteomics cannot give a definitive identification.","D L Church, T Griener, D Gregson",2024
"EF-hand calcium sensor, EfhP, controls transcriptional regulation of iron uptake by calcium in <i>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</i>.","The human pathogen <i>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</i> (<i>Pa</i>) poses a major risk for a range of severe infections, particularly lung infections in patients suffering from cystic fibrosis (CF). As previously reported, the virulent behavior of this pathogen is enhanced by elevated levels of Ca<sup>2+</sup> that are commonly present in CF nasal and lung fluids. In addition, a Ca<sup>2+</sup>-binding EF-hand protein, EfhP (PA4107), was partially characterized and shown to be critical for the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-regulated virulence in <i>P. aeruginosa</i>. Here, we describe the rapid (10 min, 60 min), and adaptive (12 h) transcriptional responses of PAO1 to elevated Ca<sup>2+</sup> detected by genome-wide RNA sequencing and show that <i>efhP</i> deletion significantly hindered both rapid and adaptive Ca<sup>2+</sup> regulation. The most differentially regulated genes included multiple Fe sequestering mechanisms, a large number of extracytoplasmic function sigma factors (ECFσ), and several virulence factors, such as the production of pyocins. The Ca<sup>2+</sup> regulation of Fe uptake was also observed in CF clinical isolates and appeared to involve the global regulator Fur. In addition, we showed that the <i>efhP</i> transcription is controlled by Ca<sup>2+</sup> and Fe, and this regulation required a Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent two-component regulatory system CarSR. Furthermore, the <i>efhP</i> expression is significantly increased in CF clinical isolates and upon pathogen internalization into epithelial cells. Overall, the results established for the first time that Ca<sup>2+</sup> controls Fe sequestering mechanisms in <i>P. aeruginosa</i> and that EfhP plays a key role in the regulatory interconnectedness between Ca<sup>2+</sup> and Fe signaling pathways, the two distinct and important signaling pathways that guide the pathogen's adaptation to the host.IMPORTANCE<i>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</i> (<i>Pa</i>) poses a major risk for severe infections, particularly in patients suffering from cystic fibrosis (CF). For the first time, kinetic RNA sequencing analysis identified <i>Pa</i> rapid and adaptive transcriptional responses to Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels consistent with those present in CF respiratory fluids. The most highly upregulated processes include iron sequestering, iron starvation sigma factors, and self-lysis factors pyocins. An EF-hand Ca<sup>2+</sup> sensor, EfhP, is required for at least 1/3 of the Ca<sup>2+</sup> response, including the majority of the iron uptake mechanisms and the production of pyocins. Transcription of <i>efhP</i> itself is regulated by Ca<sup>2+</sup> and Fe, and increases during interactions with host epithelial cells, suggesting the protein's important role in <i>Pa</i> infections. The findings establish the regulatory interconnectedness between Ca<sup>2+</sup> and iron signaling pathways that shape <i>Pa</i> transcriptional responses. Therefore, understanding Pa's transcriptional response to Ca<sup>2+</sup> and associated regulatory mechanisms will serve in the development of future therapeutics targeting <i>Pa</i>'s dangerous infections.","Jacob Burch-Konda, Biraj B Kayastha, Myriam Achour, Aya Kubo, Mackenzie Hull, Reygan Braga, Lorelei Winton, Rendi R Rogers, Erika I Lutter, Marianna A Patrauchan",2024

Quorum sensing and antibiotic resistance in polymicrobial infections.,"Quorum sensing (QS) is a critical bacterial communication system regulating behaviors like biofilm formation, virulence, and antibiotic resistance. This review highlights QS's role in polymicrobial infections, where bacterial species interactions enhance antibiotic resistance. We examine QS mechanisms, such as acyl-homoserine lactones (AHLs) in Gram-negative bacteria and autoinducing peptides (AIPs) in Gram-positive bacteria, and their impact on biofilm-associated antibiotic resistance. The challenges uniquely associated with polymicrobial infections, such as those found in cystic fibrosis lung infections, chronic wound infections, and medical device infections, are also summarized. Furthermore, we explore various laboratory models, including flow cells and dual-species culture models, used to study QS interactions in polymicrobial environments. The review also discusses promising quorum sensing inhibitors (QSIs), such as furanones and AHL analogs, which have demonstrated efficacy in reducing biofilm formation and virulence in laboratory and clinical studies. By addressing the interplay between QS and antibiotic resistance, this paper aims to advance therapeutic strategies that disrupt bacterial communication and improve antibiotic efficacy, ultimately mitigating the global challenge of antibiotic resistance in polymicrobial infections.","Sunny Cui, Esther Kim",2024

Hippo signaling cooperates with p53 to regulate lung airway mucous cell metaplasia.,"Airway mucous cell metaplasia is a significant feature of many chronic airway diseases, such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), cystic fibrosis, and asthma. However, the mechanisms underlying this process remain poorly understood. Here, we employ in vivo mouse genetic models to demonstrate that Hippo and p53 cooperate to modulate the differentiation of club cells into goblet cells. We reveal that ablation of Mst1 and Mst1 (Mst1/2), the core components of Hippo signaling, significantly reduces mucous metaplasia in the lung airways in a lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced lung inflammation murine model while promoting club cell proliferation in a Yap-dependent manner. Additionally, we show that deleting Mst1/2 is sufficient to suppress p53 deficiency-mediated goblet cell metaplasia. Finally, single-cell RNA analysis reveals a downregulation of Yap and p53 signaling in goblet cells in the human airways. These findings underscore the important role of Hippo and p53 signaling in regulating airway mucous metaplasia.","Jiangying Liu, Dan Luo, Haidi Huang, Rongzi Mu, Jianghong Yuan, Ming Jiang, Chuwen Lin, Honggang Xiang, Xinhua Lin, Haihan Song, Yongchun Zhang",2024

Evidence for secondary ciliary dyskinesia in patients with cystic fibrosis.,"Mucociliary clearance (MCC) impairment can be due to mucus abnormalities or to a ciliary dysfunction, which can be innate, or secondary to infection and/or inflammation. In cystic fibrosis (CF), it is well documented that MCC is impaired due to mucus abnormalities, but little is known concerning ciliary beating. This study aimed to confirm that ciliary dyskinesia is present in CF, and if this might be innate or secondary to the chronic infection and/or inflammation.","Romane Bonhiver, Noemie Bricmont, Maud Pirotte, Marc-Antoine Wuidart, Justine Monseur, Lionel Benchimol, Anne-Lise Poirrier, Catherine Moermans, Doriane Calmés, Florence Schleich, Renaud Louis, Marie-Christine Seghaye, Céline Kempeneers",2024
E-pharmacophore based virtual screening of potent lead molecules against Cystic Fibrosis: An in silico study.,"Cystic fibrosis is an autosomal recessive condition caused by mutations in the CFTR gene, which encodes the CFTR protein. Currently, CF is a life-limiting illness that has a limited cure. The present study aimed to identify top leads against CFTR protein with F508del in comparison with Lumacaftor. In this study, a homology model of the NBD domain of CFTR protein was developed using the available NBD domain crystal structure. The protein model was refined through apo dynamics. Energy-optimized pharmacophore mapping was carried out to identify essential features for CFTR, resulting in a model with a hydrogen-bond donor, two hydrogen-bond acceptors, and three aromatic ring sites. A screening of a compound from the NPASS database using these DAARRR six-point-pharmacophore features led to the identification of potential ligands that could act against CFTR protein. Further studies such as ADME/T, molecular dynamics, MM_GBSA, and DFT were performed to identify the top-hit compound from the NPASS database. The compound Anguibactin (NPC41982) has been identified as a top lead that exhibits higher binding affinity and stability than the reference compound Lumacaftor, suggesting their potential to bind to the active site of the CFTR protein. These compounds could serve as starting points for the development of drug-like molecules for treating cystic fibrosis.","Sabareeswari Jeyaraman, Jeyanthi Sankar, Ling Shing Wong, Karthikeyan Muthusamy",2024
[Medical clinical diagnostics for indoor mould exposure - Update 2023 (AWMF Register No. 161/001)].,"This article is an abridged version of the updated AWMF mould guideline ""Medical clinical diagnostics in case of indoor mould exposure - Update 2023"", presented in July 2023 by the German Society of Hygiene, Environmental Medicine and Preventive Medicine (Gesellschaft für Hygiene, Umweltmedizin und Präventivmedizin, GHUP), in collaboration with German and Austrian scientific medical societies, and experts. Indoor mould growth is a potential health risk, even if a quantitative and/or causal relationship between the occurrence of individual mould species and health problems has yet to be established. There is no evidence for a causal relationship between moisture/mould damage and human diseases, mainly because of the ubiquitous presence of fungi and hitherto inadequate diagnostic methods. Sufficient evidence for an association between moisture/mould damage and the following health effects has been established for: allergic respiratory diseases, allergic rhinitis, allergic rhino-conjunctivitis, allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis (ABPA), other allergic bronchopulmonary mycosis (ABPM), aspergilloma, Aspergillus bronchitis, asthma (manifestation, progression, exacerbation), bronchitis (acute, chronic), community-acquired Aspergillus pneumonia, hypersensitivity pneumonitis (HP; extrinsic allergic alveolitis (EEA)), invasive Aspergillosis, mycoses, organic dust toxic syndrome (ODTS) [workplace exposure], promotion of respiratory infections, pulmonary aspergillosis (subacute, chronic), and rhinosinusitis (acute, chronically invasive, or granulomatous, allergic). In this context the sensitizing potential of moulds is obviously low compared to other environmental allergens. Recent studies show a comparatively low sensitization prevalence of 3-22,5 % in the general population across Europe. Limited or suspected evidence for an association exist with respect to atopic eczema (atopic dermatitis, neurodermatitis; manifestation), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), mood disorders, mucous membrane irritation (MMI), odor effects, and sarcoidosis. (iv) Inadequate or insufficient evidence for an association exist for acute idiopathic pulmonary hemorrhage in infants, airborne transmitted mycotoxicosis, arthritis, autoimmune diseases, cancer, chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS), endocrinopathies, gastrointestinal effects, multiple chemical sensitivity (MCS), multiple sclerosis, neuropsychological effects, neurotoxic effects, renal effects, reproductive disorders, rheumatism, sick building syndrome (SBS), sudden infant death syndrome, teratogenicity, thyroid diseases, and urticaria.The risk of infection posed by moulds regularly occurring indoors is low for healthy persons; most species are in risk group 1 and a few in risk group 2 (<i>Aspergillus fumigatus</i>, <i>A. flavus</i>) of the German Biological Agents Act (Biostoffverordnung). Only moulds that are potentially able to form toxins can be triggers of toxic reactions. Whether or not toxin formation occurs in individual cases is determined by environmental and growth conditions, water activity, temperature and above all the growth substrates.In case of indoor moisture/mould damage, everyone can be affected by odor effects and/or mood disorders.However, this is not an acute health hazard. Predisposing factors for odor effects can include genetic and hormonal influences, imprinting, context and adaptation effects. Predisposing factors for mood disorders may include environmental concerns, anxiety, condition, and attribution, as well as various diseases. Risk groups to be protected particularly regarding infection risk are immunocompromised persons according to the classification of the German Commission for Hospital Hygiene and Infection Prevention (Kommission für Krankenhaushygiene und Infektionsprävention, KRINKO) at the Robert Koch-Institute (RKI), persons suffering from severe influenza, persons suffering from severe COVID-19, and persons with cystic fibrosis (mucoviscidosis); with regard to allergic risk, persons with cystic fibrosis (mucoviscidosis) and patients with bronchial asthma must be protected. The rational diagnostics include the medical history, physical examination, and conventional allergy diagnostics including provocation tests if necessary; sometimes cellular test systems are indicated. In the case of mould infections, the reader is referred to the specific guidelines. Regarding mycotoxins, there are currently no useful and validated test procedures for clinical diagnostics. From a preventive medical point of view, it is important that indoor mould infestation in relevant magnitudes cannot be tolerated for precautionary reasons.For evaluation of mould damage in the indoor environment and appropriate remedial procedures, the reader is referred to the mould guideline issued by the German Federal Environment Agency (Umweltbundesamt, UBA).","Julia Hurraß, Birger Heinzow, Sandra Walser-Reichenbach, Ute Aurbach, Sven Becker, Romuald Bellmann, Karl-Christian Bergmann, Oliver A Cornely, Steffen Engelhart, Guido Fischer, Thomas Gabrio, Caroline E W Herr, Marcus Joest, Christian Karagiannidis, Ludger Klimek, Martin Köberle, Annette Kolk, Herbert Lichtnecker, Thomas Lob-Corzilius, Norbert Mülleneisen, Dennis Nowak, Uta Rabe, Monika Raulf, Jörg Steinmann, Jens-Oliver Steiß, Jannik Stemler, Ulli Umpfenbach, Kerttu Valtanen, Barbora Werchan, Birgit Willinger, Gerhard A Wiesmüller",2024

"E.PathDash, pathway activation analysis of publicly available pathogen gene expression data.","E.PathDash facilitates re-analysis of gene expression data from pathogens clinically relevant to chronic respiratory diseases, including a total of 48 studies, 548 samples, and 404 unique treatment comparisons. The application enables users to assess broad biological stress responses at the KEGG pathway or gene ontology level and also provides data for individual genes. E.PathDash reduces the time required to gain access to data from multiple hours per data set to seconds. Users can download high-quality images such as volcano plots and boxplots, differential gene expression results, and raw count data, making it fully interoperable with other tools. Importantly, users can rapidly toggle between experimental comparisons and different studies of the same phenomenon, enabling them to judge the extent to which observed responses are reproducible. As a proof of principle, we invited two cystic fibrosis scientists to use the application to explore scientific questions relevant to their specific research areas. Reassuringly, pathway activation analysis recapitulated results reported in original publications, but it also yielded new insights into pathogen responses to changes in their environments, validating the utility of the application.

Assessment of Oral Hygiene and Gingivitis in Adolescents With and Without Cystic Fibrosis.,"<b>Purpose:</b> To assess oral hygiene, gingivitis, and the association between them for adolescents with cystic fibrosis (CF) compared to nonCF controls. <b>Methods:</b> This was a cross-sectional study of adolescents with CF aged 12 to 17 years (n=27), compared to two non-CF control groups: Medicaid-enrolled adolescents with special health care needs (ASHCN; n=60) and healthy Medicaid-enrolled adolescents (n=185). Dental plaque was a proxy for oral hygiene, and gingival bleeding was a proxy for gingivitis. This study employed confounder-adjusted binomial logistic regression to compare outcomes between adolescents with CF and controls. <b>Results:</b> After adjusting for confounders, adolescents with CF had significantly poorer oral hygiene than controls (CF versus ASHCN odds ratio [OR] = 2.9, 95 percent confidence interval [95% CI] = 2.0 to 4.4, P<0.001; CF versus healthy OR = 1.7, 95% CI=1.3 to 2.2, P<0.001), but there was no significant difference in gingivitis (CF versus ASHCN OR=1.3, 95% CI=0.87 to 1.9, P=0.21; CF versus healthy OR = 0.80, 95% CI=0.60 to 0.99, P=0.04). Poor oral hygiene was significantly associated with gingivitis for all adolescents (CF OR=1.2, 95% CI=1.1 to 1.4, P<0.001; ASHCN OR = 1.8, 95% CI=1.6 to 2.0, P<0.001; healthy OR = 1.2, 95% CI=1.1 to 1.3, P<0.001). <b>Conclusions:</b> Adolescents with CF had poorer oral hygiene than non-CF controls but similar levels of gingivitis. Future efforts should identify factors that protect adolescents with CF from gingivitis.","Alaa A Alkhateeb, Alice Ko, Donald L Chi",2024
Pulmonary manifestations of Pseudohypoaldosteronism type 1b: A systematic review of the literature.,"Pseudohypoaldosteronism type 1b (PHA1B) is a rare autosomal recessive disease caused by dysfunction of amiloride-sensitive epithelial sodium channels (ENaC), that might present with a wide variety of pulmonary symptoms.","Anastasios-Panagiotis Chantzaras, Panagiota Panagiotou, Georgia Koltsida, Angeliki Moudaki, Christina Kanaka-Gantenbein, Athanasios G Kaditis",2024
Development of metabolic syndrome in people with Cystic Fibrosis one year after exposure to elexacaftor-tezacaftor-ivacaftor.,"The constellation of hypertension, truncal obesity, impaired fasting glucose, low high-density lipoprotein, and hypertriglyceridemia is known as metabolic syndrome (MetSyn) and is associated with cardiovascular and other diseases. Elexacaftor-tezacaftor-ivacaftor (ETI) in people with cystic fibrosis (pwCF) is associated with weight gain but effects on cardiovascular risk are unknown. This study sought to investigate ETI exposure and risk for development of MetSyn in pwCF.","Gregory A Ratti, Hannah Smith, Sasan Mirfakhraee, Joan Reisch, Leah Cohen, Raksha Jain, James D Finklea",2024
Novel Corrector for Variants of SLC6A8: A Therapeutic Opportunity for Creatine Transporter Deficiency.,"Mutations in creatine transporter SLC6A8 cause creatine transporter deficiency (CTD), which is responsible for 2% of all cases of X-linked intellectual disability. CTD has no current treatments and has a high unmet medical need. Inspired by the transformational therapeutic impact of small molecule ""correctors"" for the treatment of cystic fibrosis, which bind to mutated versions of the CFTR ion channel to promote its trafficking to the cell surface, we sought to identify small molecules that could stabilize SLC6A8 as a potential treatment for CTD. We leveraged a novel chemoproteomic technology for ligand discovery, reactive affinity probe interaction discovery, to identify small-molecule fragments with photoaffinity handles that bind to SLC6A8 in a cellular environment. We synthesized a library of irreversible covalent analogs of these molecules to characterize in functional assays, which revealed molecules that could promote the trafficking of mutant SLC6A8 variants to the cell surface. Further medicinal chemistry was able to identify reversible drug-like small molecules that both promoted trafficking of the transporter and also rescued creatine uptake. When profiled across the 27 most prevalent SLC6A8 missense variants, we found that 10-20% of patient mutations were amenable to correction by our molecules. These results were verified in an endogenous setting using the CRISPR knock-in of selected missense alleles. We established in vivo proof-of-mechanism for correctors in a novel CTD mouse model with the P544L patient-defined variant knocked in to the SLC6A8 locus, where treatment with our orally bioavailable and brain penetrant tool corrector increased brain creatine levels in heterozygous female mice, validating correctors as a potential therapeutic approach for CTD.","Lara N Gechijian, Giovanni Muncipinto, T Justin Rettenmaier, Matthew T Labenski, Victor Rusu, Lea Rosskamp, Leslie Conway, Daniel van Kalken, Liam Gross, Gianna Iantosca, William Crotty, Robert Mathis, Hyejin Park, Benjamin Rabin, Christina Westgate, Matthew Lyons, Chloe Deshusses, Nicholas Brandon, Dean G Brown, Heather S Blanchette, Nicholas Pullen, Lyn H Jones, Joel C Barrish",2024
Restoring CFTR function with Orkambi decreases the severity of alcohol-induced acute pancreatitis.,"Heavy alcohol intake is one of the most common causes of acute pancreatitis (AP). We have previously shown that ethanol (EtOH) decreases the expression and activity of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR), which plays a key role in alcohol-induced AP development. The prescription drug, Orkambi (a combination of ivacaftor and lumacaftor) can correct impaired CFTR function and expression in cystic fibrosis (CF) patients. Thus, the present study aimed to investigate whether Orkambi can mitigate alcohol-induced AP. Intact guinea-pig pancreatic ducts were pre-treated with different concentrations of ethanol (EtOH; 30, 50 and 100 mm) for 12 h alone or in combination with ivacaftor (VX770) and/or lumacaftor (VX-809), and CFTR expression and activity were evaluated by immunostaining and by the patch clamp technique, respectively. Alcoholic AP was induced in Orkambi-treated guinea-pigs, and standard laboratory and histological parameters were measured. Ivacaftor and lumacaftor alone or in combination dose-dependently restored the apical expression and activity of CFTR after EtOH treatment in vitro. Oral administration of Orkambi reduced the severity of alcohol-induced AP and restored impaired CFTR activity and expression. Orkambi is able to restore the CFTR defect caused by EtOH and decreases the severity of alcohol-induced pancreatitis. This is the first in vivo pre-clinical evidence of Orkambi efficacy in the treatment of alcohol-induced AP. KEY POINTS: Acute pancreatitis is one of the leading causes of hospital admission among gastrointestinal diseases in which the lack of a specific drug therapy plays a crucial role. The cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) plays an essential role in pancreatic ductal HCO<sub>3</sub> <sup>-</sup> secretion; inappropriate CFTR function, as seen in heavy alcohol consumption, increases the risk of pancreatitis development. CFTR modulators are able to prevent the inhibitory effect of ethanol and reduce pancreatic ductal injury and the severity of alcohol-induced pancreatitis. CFTR modulators present a novel option in the pharmacotherapy of alcohol-induced pancreatitis by enhancing pancreatic functions or preventing recurrence.","Viktória Venglovecz, Anna Grassalkovich, Emese Tóth, Attila Ébert, Eleonóra Gál, Marietta Margaréta Korsós, József Maléth, Zoltán Rakonczay, Zsolt Galla, Péter Monostori, Péter Hegyi",2024
The RNA Binding Protein Tristetraprolin Contributes to <i>CFTR</i> mRNA Stability in Cystic Fibrosis.,"Cystic Fibrosis (CF) is the most common inherited disorder and is characterized by an inflammatory phenotype. Here, we found that in bronchial epithelium reconstituted form lung tissue biopsies from patients with CF, the RNA-binding protein tristetraprolin (TTP), a key regulator of inflammation, is dysregulated in cells that strongly express cytokines and interleukins. TTP activity is regulated by extensive post-translational modifications, particularly phosphorylation. We found that in addition to mRNA downregulation, phosphorylated TTP (which cannot bind to mRNA) accumulated in CF cultures, suggesting that the imbalance in TTP phosphorylation status could contribute to the inflammatory phenotype in CF. We confirmed TTP destabilizing role on <i>IL8</i> mRNA through its 3'UTR sequence in CF cells. We next demonstrated that TTP phosphorylation is mainly regulated by MK2 through activation of ERK, which also was hyperphosphorylated. TTP is considered a mRNA decay factor with some exception, and we present a new positive role of TTP in CF cultures. We determined that TTP binds to specific ARE motifs on the 3'UTR of mRNA sequences and also, for the first time, to the 3'UTR of Cystic Fibrosis Transmembrane Conductance Regulator (<i>CFTR</i>) where TTP binding stabilizes the mRNA level. This study identified new partners that can be targeted in CF and proposes a new way to control <i>CFTR</i> gene expression.","Alexandra Pommier, Solenne Bleuse, Karine Deletang, Jessica Varilh, Marion Nadaud, Prisca Boisguerin, Arnaud Bourdin, Magali Taulan-Cadars",2024
