Adrenal Insufficiency with Hypoglycemia in a Medically Complex Pediatric Patient.,"Medically complex children present a low frequency but often high acuity patient population for Emergency Medical Services (EMS) personnel. We present a case of a 12-year-old male with Duchenne muscular dystrophy and adrenal agenesis found unresponsive. Detailed history-taking was crucial for diagnostic accuracy and this patient's favorable outcome. This case highlights the importance of recognizing adrenal insufficiency-induced hypoglycemia in patients presenting with altered mental status. Emergency Medical Services personnel should be trained to identify and manage adrenal insufficiency, using detailed histories and on-scene medical oversight to improve outcomes.","Kevin T Argentieri, Christine M Brent, Stacey K Noel",2024
Genetic Panel Reveals Coexisting Neuromuscular Disorders in Patients With Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy.,"Duchenne muscular dystrophy is a genetically based neuromuscular disorder characterized by progressive physical impairment and cardiomyopathy in children, leading to fatal cardiac or respiratory failure. Duchenne muscular dystrophy shares some overlapping clinical features with other disorders, complicating clinical differentiation. We hypothesized that some Duchenne muscular dystrophy patients may have a secondary neuromuscular disorders that could negatively skew data during pharmaceutical clinical trials and lead to incomplete treatment plans. Consecutive genetic panels on 353 patients were reviewed. Thirty-two (32; 9.1%) patients with Duchenne muscular dystrophy were identified. Three (3; 9.4%) were found to have at least 1 genetically confirmed secondary neuromuscular disorder. Overlooking these coexisting disorders could lead to unexpected treatment failures, potentially affecting medication efficacy in trials or commercial use. Secondary neuromuscular disorders should be considered in Duchenne muscular dystrophy patients before clinical trial enrollment or treatment planning, with expanded genetic testing, such as whole exome sequencing or whole genome sequencing, likely to reveal even more secondary disorders.","Carter Butson, Nedeke Ntekim, Stephanie Acord, Warren Marks",2024
[Deflazacort-induced Steven-Johnson syndrome: a case report and literature review].,"<b>Objective:</b> To summarize the clinical features and outcomes of deflazacort-induced Steven Johnson syndrome (SJS)-toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN) to raise awareness among patients with Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD), neurologists as well as other deflazacort users. <b>Methods:</b> The clinical data of a boy with DMD who had SJS induced by deflazacort treated at the Department of Rheumatology & Clinical Immunology of Tianjin Children's Hospital in July 2024 was analyzed retrospectively. Taking ""deflazacort"" ""Steven-Johnson syndrome"" ""toxic epidermal necrolysis"" in Chinese or English as the keywords, literature was searched at CNKI, Wanfang, China Biomedical Literature Database and PubMed up to July 2024. The clinical characteristics, treatment and outcomes of deflazacort-induced SJS-TEN were summarized. <b>Results:</b> A 12-year-old boy was admitted with a 3-day history of rash. He was diagnosed with DMD at the age of 3 and had been treated with prednisolone since the age of 8. Forty-four days before admission, the patient started deflazacort to replace prednisolone. Three days before admission, progressively worsening erythematous maculopapular rashes, blisters and skin peeling (8% body surface area), oral mucosal erosion, and exudative conjunctivitis occurred, thus deflazacort was discontinued. Complete remission of SJS was achieved after treatment with intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG, total 1.4 g/kg), 2 doses of etanercept (0.9 mg/kg, once), subcutaneous injection and intravenous methylprednisolone (0.7 mg/(kg·d)). Based on the literature, there were 5 reports in English while none in Chinese, altogether 7 cases were reported. All the patients were male, aged 3-45 years. Duration of deflazacort exposure was 2-8 weeks. Dermatology diagnosis of our case was SJS, and 5 cases were TEN. One patient was diagnosed with exudative erythema multiforme, and subsequent deflazacort oral challenge test was positive. Treatment included methylprednisolone or dexamethasone in 5 cases, IVIG in 6 cases, etanercept in 3 cases and cyclosporine in 1 case. All patients recovered completely. <b>Conclusion:</b> The synthetic corticosteroid deflazacort can cause rare but severe adverse reactions such as SJS-TEN, which needs close monitoring and prompt recognition and management.","C W Li, N Sun, S N Li, Y C Zhang, J J Ma",2024
Early diagnosis of Duchenne muscular dystrophy - A Treat-NMD international workshop.,"The diagnosis of Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is significant at any stage, however an early diagnosis in a presymptomatic or very early phase of DMD, offers unique opportunities and challenges for families and health care providers. Currently, there is limited evidence as to the optimal models of care during this stage of the condition.. To address this, in 2023, Treat-NMD facilitated the Early Diagnosis for DMD project; bringing together 42 experts from across Europe, the US and Australasia, including health care professionals, researchers, and people with lived experience to discuss the complexities of an early or newborn diagnosis of DMD, and provide recommendations regarding approaches to multidisciplinary care. A series of virtual meetings followed by a hybrid workshop resulted in broad recommendations to support clinicians in caring for children and families following an early diagnosis of DMD. The workshop did not define a cut-off for early diagnosis, however much of the discussion focused on diagnoses that occurred prior to 2 years. There is recognition that boys may first present with non-motor symptoms, such as speech delay or neurodevelopmental issues that are secondary to their dystrophinopathy, and therefore this report refers reflects that infants with DMD may be presymptomatic or early symptomatic.","M Lorentzos, J A Parsons, K J Jones, L Servais",2024
Histone deacetylase 6 inhibition promotes microtubule acetylation and facilitates autophagosome-lysosome fusion in dystrophin-deficient mdx mice.,"Duchenne muscular dystrophy is a progressive muscle-wasting disease caused by mutations in the dystrophin gene. Despite progress in dystrophin-targeted gene therapies, it is still a fatal disease requiring novel therapeutics that can be used synergistically or alternatively to emerging gene therapy. Defective autophagy and disorganized microtubule networks contribute to dystrophic pathogenesis, yet the mechanisms by which microtubule alterations regulate autophagy remain elusive. The present study was designed to uncover possible mechanisms underpinning the role of microtubules in regulating autophagy in dystrophic mice.","Akanksha Agrawal, Erin L Clayton, Courtney L Cavazos, Benjamin A Clayton, George G Rodney",2024

"Exploring novel natural compound-based therapies for Duchenne muscular dystrophy management: insights from network pharmacology, QSAR modeling, molecular dynamics, and free energy calculations.","Muscular dystrophies encompass a heterogeneous group of rare neuromuscular diseases characterized by progressive muscle degeneration and weakness. Among these, Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) stands out as one of the most severe forms. The present study employs an integrative approach combining network pharmacology, quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) modeling, molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, and free energy calculations to identify potential therapeutic targets and natural compounds for DMD. Upon analyzing the GSE38417 dataset, it was found that individuals with DMD exhibited 290 upregulated differentially expressed genes (DEGs) compared to healthy controls. By utilizing gene ontology (GO) and protein-protein interaction (PPI) network analysis, this study provides insights into the functional roles of the identified DEGs, identifying ten hub genes that play a critical role in the pathology of DMD. These key genes include DMD, TTN, PLEC, DTNA, PKP2, SLC24A, FBXO32, SNTA1, SMAD3, and NOS1. Furthermore, through the use of ligand-based pharmacophore modeling and virtual screening, three natural compounds were identified as potential inhibitors. Among these, compounds 3874518 and 12314417 have demonstrated significant promise as an inhibitor of the SMAD3 protein, a crucial factor in the fibrotic and inflammatory mechanisms associated with DMD. The therapeutic potential of the compounds was further supported by molecular dynamics simulation and Molecular Mechanics/Generalized Born Surface Area (MM/GBSA) analysis. These findings suggest that the compounds are viable candidates for experimental validation against DMD.","Mohd Saeed, Ashanul Haque, Ambreen Shoaib, Syed Mohd Danish Rizvi",2024
Cerebellar dysfunction in the mdx mouse model of Duchenne muscular dystrophy: An electrophysiological and behavioural study.,"Patients with Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) commonly show specific cognitive deficits in addition to a severe muscle impairment caused by the absence of dystrophin expression in skeletal muscle. These cognitive deficits have been related to the absence of dystrophin in specific regions of the central nervous system, notably cerebellar Purkinje cells (PCs). Dystrophin has recently been involved in GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors clustering at postsynaptic densities, and its absence, by disrupting this clustering, leads to decreased inhibitory input to PC. We performed an in vivo electrophysiological study of the dystrophin-deficient muscular dystrophy X-linked (mdx) mouse model of DMD to compare PC firing and local field potential (LFP) in alert mdx and control C57Bl/10 mice. We found that the absence of dystrophin is associated with altered PC firing and the emergence of fast (~160-200 Hz) LFP oscillations in the cerebellar cortex of alert mdx mice. These abnormalities were not related to the disrupted expression of calcium-binding proteins in cerebellar PC. We also demonstrate that cerebellar long-term depression is altered in alert mdx mice. Finally, mdx mice displayed a force weakness, mild impairment of motor coordination and balance during behavioural tests. These findings demonstrate the existence of cerebellar dysfunction in mdx mice. A similar cerebellar dysfunction may contribute to the cognitive deficits observed in patients with DMD.","Cynthia Prigogine, Javier Marquez Ruiz, Ana Maria Cebolla, Nicolas Deconinck, Laurent Servais, Philippe Gailly, Bernard Dan, Guy Cheron",2024

In Silico Structural Prediction for the Generation of Novel Performant Midi-Dystrophins Based on Intein-Mediated Dual AAV Approach.,"Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy (DMD) is a pediatric disorder characterized by progressive muscle degeneration and premature death, and has no current cure. The current, most promising therapeutic avenue is based on gene replacement mediated by adeno-associated viruses (AAVs) using a shortened, but still functional, version of dystrophin, known as micro-dystrophin (µDys), to fit AAV capacity. The limited improvements observed in clinical trials suggest a sub-optimal performance of µDys in the human context that could be due to the lack of key domains in the protein. Therefore, expressing larger dystrophin proteins may be necessary for a more complete correction of the disease phenotype. In this study, we developed three novel midi-dystrophin constructs using a dual-AAV approach, leveraging split-intein-based protein trans-splicing. The midi-dystrophins include additional domains compared to µDys, such as the central cytoskeleton-binding domain, nNOS and Par1b interacting domains, and a complete C-terminal region. Given the limited capacity of each AAV vector, we strategically partially reduced hinge regions while ensuring that the structural stability of the protein remains intact. We predicted the interactions between the two halves of the split midi-Dys proteins thanks to the deep learning algorithm AphaFold3. We observed strong associations between the N- and C-termini in midi-Dys 1 and 2, while a weaker interaction in midi-Dys 3 was revealed. Our subsequent experiments confirmed the efficient protein trans-splicing both in vitro and in vivo in DBA2/mdx mice of the midi-Dys 1 and 2 and not in midi-Dys 3 as expected from the structural prediction. Additionally, we demonstrated that midi-Dys 1 and 2 exhibit significant therapeutic efficacy in DBA2/mdx mice, highlighting their potential as therapeutic agents for DMD. Overall, these findings highlight the potential of deep learning-based structural modeling for the generation of intein-based dystrophin versions and pose the basis for further investigation of these new midi-dystrophins versions for clinical studies.","Laura Palmieri, Maxime Ferrand, Ai Vu Hong, Isabelle Richard, Sonia Albini",2024
Macrophages in the Context of Muscle Regeneration and Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy.,"Macrophages are essential to muscle regeneration, as they regulate inflammation, carry out phagocytosis, and facilitate tissue repair. These cells exhibit phenotypic switching from pro-inflammatory (M1) to anti-inflammatory (M2) states during muscle repair, influencing myoblast proliferation, differentiation, and myofiber formation. In Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy (DMD), asynchronous muscle injuries disrupt the normal temporal stages of regeneration, leading to fibrosis and failed regeneration. Altered macrophage activity is associated with DMD progression and physiopathology. Gaining insight into the intricate relationship between macrophages and muscle cells is crucial for creating effective therapies aimed at treating this muscle disorder. This review explores the dynamic functions of macrophages in muscle regeneration and their implications in DMD.","Francisco Hernandez-Torres, Lidia Matias-Valiente, Virginia Alzas-Gomez, Amelia Eva Aranega",2024
Effect of Oral Zinc Supplementation on Phase Angle and Bioelectrical Impedance Vector Analysis in Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy: A Non-Randomized Clinical Trial.,"Zinc plays a crucial role in cell structure and functionality. Neurodegenerative Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) alters muscle membrane structure, leading to a loss of muscle mass and strength. The objective of this study was to evaluate the changes in phase angle (PA) and bioelectrical impedance vector analysis (BIVA) results in patients with DMD after oral zinc supplementation. This clinical trial included 33 boys aged 5.6 to 24.5 years diagnosed with DMD. They were divided into three groups according to age (G1, G2, and G3) and supplemented with oral zinc. The mean serum zinc concentration was 74 μg/dL, and 29% of patients had concentrations below the reference value. The baseline values (mean (standard deviation)) of the bioelectrical impedance parameters PA, resistance (R), and reactance (Xc) were 2.59° (0.84°), 924.36 (212.31) Ω, and 39.64 (8.41) Ω, respectively. An increase in R and a decrease in PA and lean mass proportional to age were observed, along with a negative correlation (r = -0.614; <i>p</i> < 0.001) between age and PA. The average cell mass in G1 was greater than that in G3 (<i>p</i> = 0.012). There were no significant differences in serum zinc levels or bioelectrical impedance parameters before and after zinc supplementation. We conclude that this population is at risk of zinc deficiency and the proposed dosage of zinc supplementation was not sufficient to alter serum zinc levels, PA and BIVA results.","Karina Marques Vermeulen-Serpa, Márcia Marilia Gomes Dantas Lopes, Camila Xavier Alves, Evellyn Camara Grilo, Thais Alves Cunha, Carolinne Thaisa de Oliveira Fernandes Miranda, Breno Gustavo Porfirio Bezerra, Lucia Leite-Lais, José Brandão-Neto, Sancha Helena de Lima Vale",2024
Transcriptional changes of genes encoding sarcoplasmic reticulum calcium binding and up-taking proteins in normal and Duchenne muscular dystrophy dogs.,Cytosolic calcium overload contributes to muscle degradation in Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD). The sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) is the primary calcium storage organelle in muscle. The sarco-endoplasmic reticulum ATPase (SERCA) pumps cytosolic calcium to the SR during muscle relaxation. Calcium is kept in the SR by calcium-binding proteins.,"Emily D Morales, Dongxin Wang, Matthew J Burke, Jin Han, Drake D Devine, Keqing Zhang, Dongsheng Duan",2024
Obesity Management in Youth with Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy: A Review of Metformin and Alternative Pharmacotherapies.,"<b><i>Background:</i></b> Individuals with Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) have increased risk of obesity from prolonged glucocorticoid use and progressive muscle weakness. Over 50% have obesity by the teenage years. <b><i>Objectives</i></b>: The current study examines literature on obesity management in DMD and describes how obesity pharmacotherapy can be used in this high-risk cohort. <b><i>Methods:</i></b> This review was conducted in adherence to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses extension for Scoping Reviews checklist. A Pubmed Database search was conducted from January 2000 to May 2024. Included terms were DMD and topiramate, phentermine, metformin, glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist, semaglutide, and liraglutide. Eligible studies were cataloged to examine obesity pharmacotherapy, side effect profiles, and clinical outcomes. <b><i>Results:</i></b> Twenty studies met inclusion criteria, 18 on metformin. Reviewed studies varied in duration from 4 to 24 weeks, ages 6.5-44 years old, with 112 participants total (range: 1-30 participants). Included studies were: eight animal studies, six clinical trials, four reviews, one cohort study, and one case report. Primary outcomes varied among studies: muscular degeneration and function (15 articles), cardiac function (2 articles), weight loss (2 articles), and general endocrine care (1 article). <b><i>Conclusions:</i></b> Adjunct obesity pharmacotherapy use in youth with DMD is promising but needs to be confirmed. Large gaps include appropriate agent selection, side effect monitoring, and dose escalation. The overall quality of pediatric-specific evidence for the use of obesity pharmacotherapy in youth with DMD is low. Future research is needed to investigate how to safely utilize these agents.","Victoria Goldman, Anna Ryabets-Lienhard, Lauren Howard, Roshni Kohli, Emily Sousa, Priya Patel, Ian Marpuri, Alaina P Vidmar",2024
Identification and analysis of differentially expressed lncRNAs and their ceRNA networks in DMD/mdx primary myoblasts.,"This study explored the significance of long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs), particularly their role in maintaining dystrophin protein stability and regulating myocyte proliferation and differentiation. The investigation focused on DMD/mdx mouse skeletal muscle primary myoblasts, aiming to identify lncRNAs potential as biomarkers and therapeutic targets for Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD). Utilizing CLC Genomics Workbench software, 554 differentially expressed lncRNAs were identified in DMD/mdx mice compared to wild-type (WT) control. Among them, 373 were upregulated, and 181 were downregulated. The study highlighted specific lncRNAs (e.g., 5930430L01Rik, Gm10143, LncRNA1490, LncRNA580) and their potential regulatory roles in DMD key genes like IGF1, FN1, TNNI1, and MYOD1. By predicting miRNA and their connections with lncRNA and mRNA (ceRNA network) using tools such as miRNet, miRSYSTEM and miRCARTA, the study revealed potential indirect regulation of Dystrophin, IGF1R and UTRN genes by identified lncRNAs (e.g. 2310001H17Rik-203, C130073E24Rik-202, LncRNA2767, 5930430L01Rik and LncRNA580). These findings suggest that the identified lncRNAs may play crucial roles in the development and progression of DMD through their regulatory influence on key gene expression, providing valuable insights for potential therapeutic interventions.","Abdolvahab Ebrahimpour Gorji, Kasra Ahmadian, Zahra Roudbari, Tomasz Sadkowski",2024

AAV gene therapy for Duchenne muscular dystrophy: the EMBARK phase 3 randomized trial.,"Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is a rare, X-linked neuromuscular disease caused by pathogenic variants in the DMD gene that result in the absence of functional dystrophin, beginning at birth and leading to progressive impaired motor function, loss of ambulation and life-threatening cardiorespiratory complications. Delandistrogene moxeparvovec, an adeno-associated rh74-viral vector-based gene therapy, addresses absent functional dystrophin in DMD. Here the phase 3 EMBARK study aimed to assess the efficacy and safety of delandistrogene moxeparvovec in patients with DMD. Ambulatory males with DMD, ≥4 years to <8 years of age, were randomized and stratified by age group and North Star Ambulatory Assessment (NSAA) score to single-administration intravenous delandistrogene moxeparvovec (1.33 × 10<sup>14</sup> vector genomes per kilogram; n = 63) or placebo (n = 62). At week 52, the primary endpoint, change from baseline in NSAA score, was not met (least squares mean 2.57 (delandistrogene moxeparvovec) versus 1.92 (placebo) points; between-group difference, 0.65; 95% confidence interval (CI), -0.45, 1.74; P = 0.2441). Secondary efficacy endpoints included mean micro-dystrophin expression at week 12: 34.29% (treated) versus 0.00% (placebo). Other secondary efficacy endpoints at week 52 (between-group differences (95% CI)) included: Time to Rise (-0.64 (-1.06, -0.23)), 10-meter Walk/Run (-0.42 (-0.71, -0.13)), stride velocity 95th centile (0.10 (0.00, 0.19)), 100-meter Walk/Run (-3.29 (-8.28, 1.70)), time to ascend 4 steps (-0.36 (-0.71, -0.01)), PROMIS Mobility and Upper Extremity (0.05 (-0.08, 0.19); -0.04 (-0.24, 0.17)) and number of NSAA skills gained/improved (0.19 (-0.67, 1.06)). In total, 674 adverse events were recorded with delandistrogene moxeparvovec and 514 with placebo. There were no deaths, discontinuations or clinically significant complement-mediated adverse events; 7 patients (11.1%) experienced 10 treatment-related serious adverse events. Delandistrogene moxeparvovec did not lead to a significant improvement in NSAA score at week 52. Some of the secondary endpoints numerically favored treatment, although no statistical significance can be claimed. Safety was manageable and consistent with previous delandistrogene moxeparvovec trials.

Safety and efficacy of viltolarsen in ambulatory and nonambulatory males with Duchenne muscular dystrophy.,"Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is an X-linked recessive disease characterized by mutations in the dystrophin gene, causing motor and pulmonary function decline. Viltolarsen is indicated for patients with dystrophin gene mutations amenable to exon 53 skipping. Here, we report safety, motor function, and the first pulmonary function results from the open-label, phase II Galactic53 trial of viltolarsen (NCT04956289). Male participants aged ≥ 8 years with DMD received 80 mg/kg intravenous viltolarsen once weekly for 48 weeks. Results from participants receiving viltolarsen were compared with an external control cohort group-matched for multiple variables. All treatment-emergent adverse events were mild or moderate, 4 were considered treatment-related, and no participants discontinued. Participants receiving viltolarsen experienced clinically meaningful benefits in pulmonary function with higher percent predicted forced vital capacity and higher peak cough flow at Week 49 compared with the control cohort for both ambulatory and nonambulatory participants. Viltolarsen also stabilized upper limb motor function over the Treatment Period. These results support viltolarsen as an important part of the treatment armamentarium for both ambulatory as well as nonambulatory patients with DMD.","Amy D Harper, Haluk Topaloglu, Eugenio Mercuri, Vasiliy Suslov, Liwen Wu, Cigdem Y Ayanoglu, Michael Tansey, Michelle L Previtera, Robert A Crozier, Leslie Magnus, Paula R Clemens",2024
Antisense oligonucleotides and their applications in rare neurological diseases.,"Rare diseases affect almost 500 million people globally, predominantly impacting children and often leading to significantly impaired quality of life and high treatment costs. While significant contributions have been made to develop effective treatments for those with rare diseases, more rapid drug discovery strategies are needed. Therapeutic antisense oligonucleotides can modulate target gene expression with high specificity through various mechanisms determined by base sequences and chemical modifications; and have shown efficacy in clinical trials for a few rare neurological conditions. Therefore, this review will focus on the applications of antisense oligonucleotides, in particular splice-switching antisense oligomers as promising therapeutics for rare neurological diseases, with key examples of Duchenne muscular dystrophy and spinal muscular atrophy. Challenges and future perspectives in developing antisense therapeutics for rare conditions including target discovery, antisense chemical modifications, animal models for therapeutic validations, and clinical trial designs will also be briefly discussed.","Simon McDowall, May Aung-Htut, Steve Wilton, Dunhui Li",2024
Lessons learned from the RE(ACT) conference on medical devices for rare diseases.,"The field of rare disease therapeutics has witnessed significant growth in recent years, highlighting the need for diverse therapeutic approaches to cater to the unique needs of individuals with rare diseases. Rare disease therapies encompass a broad spectrum of interventions, including orphan medicinal products, orphan medical devices, rehabilitative therapies, and digital therapeutics, with the lines between these categories blurring. This paper covers the session of the RE (ACT)-IRDiRC Conference 2023 and delves into the landscape of orphan medical device research and development, shedding light on the challenges and opportunities in this burgeoning field. It provides a short overview of the different international legislations in the field. In addition, it highlights several exemplary orphan medical devices. The first example is an exoskeleton for boys with Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy, enabling them to maintain arm functionality and independence. Another example presented was an EEG device linked to an app detecting seizures in rare epilepsy conditions, which alerts caregivers to seizures in real-time but also facilitates objective seizure reporting for clinicians, aiding in diagnosis and treatment optimization. It also showcases the role of gamification and enabling technologies in addressing rare diseases, by showing a game designed for children with cystic fibrosis, and a telemedicine system for rehabilitation therapy. Both solutions aim to improve patients' understanding of their conditions and enhance their self-management. In conclusion, this paper underscores the critical need for patient-centric orphan and pediatric medical devices to provide therapeutic options for individuals with rare diseases. It highlights the impact of existing devices on enhancing the quality of life for rare disease patients and emphasizes the necessity for greater incentives and support for research and development in this field.","Anneliene H Jonker, Tim Buckinx, Lucia Pannese, Paulien Klap, José-Alain Sahel, Marc Dooms",2024

Long-term course of gastrostomy nutritional management in patients with Duchenne muscular dystrophy: A retrospective cohort study.,"Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is a progressive neuromuscular disease that commonly requires gastrostomy due to dysphagia. This study aimed to investigate the proportion of patients with DMD requiring gastrostomy and to assess the timing and outcomes of gastrostomy in patients with DMD to optimize perioperative care and improve long-term management. We conducted a retrospective cohort study by reviewing the medical records of patients with DMD treated between March 1991 and November 2023 at Kobe University Hospital. To identify risk factors for gastrostomy, Fisher's two-tailed test and logistic analysis were used to compare the gastrostomy (group G) and comparison group without gastrostomy (group C) groups. We identified patients >18 years with DMD. We excluded those without medical records from the last decade and those on nasogastric tube feeding. Among the 135 eligible patients, five (median age, 23 years) underwent percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG; uptake rate, 3.7 %), and their data were analyzed for perioperative outcomes. Complications included ventilatory disturbances, aspiration pneumonia, and hemorrhagic shock. Two patients experienced significant postoperative complications, underscoring the high-risk nature of PEG in this population. Participants' postoperative weight changes varied significantly. The presence or absence of ventilatory management, cardiomyopathy treatment, scoliosis, and steroid treatment were examined as risk factors between groups G and C, but no significant differences were observed. This study highlights low gastrostomy usage among patients with DMD, with varying outcomes. Meticulous planning and early consideration of gastrostomy are crucial to enhance the quality of life and nutritional outcomes in these patients.","Yuki Takanarita, Yuichi Okata, Hiroyuki Awano, Ryosuke Bo, Yuko Bitoh",2024
A model-informed clinical trial simulation tool with a graphical user interface for Duchenne muscular dystrophy.,"Quantitative model-based clinical trial simulation tools play a critical role in informing study designs through simulation before actual execution. These tools help drug developers explore various trial scenarios in silico to select a clinical trial design to detect therapeutic effects more efficiently, therefore reducing time, expense, and participants' burden. To increase the usability of the tools, user-friendly and interactive platforms should be developed to navigate various simulation scenarios. However, developing such tools challenges researchers, requiring expertise in modeling and interface development. This tutorial aims to address this gap by guiding developers in creating tailored R Shiny apps, using an example of a model-based clinical trial simulation tool that we developed for Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD). In this tutorial, the structural framework, essential controllers, and visualization techniques for analysis are described, along with key code examples such as criteria selection and power calculation. A virtual population was created using a machine learning algorithm to enlarge the available sample size to simulate clinical trial scenarios in the presented tool. In addition, external validation of the simulated outputs was conducted using a placebo arm of a recently published DMD trial. This tutorial will be particularly useful for developing clinical trial simulation tools based on DMD progression models for other end points and biomarkers. The presented strategies can also be applied to other diseases.","Jongjin Kim, Juan Francisco Morales, Sanghoon Kang, Marian Klose, Rebecca J Willcocks, Michael J Daniels, Ramona Belfiore-Oshan, Glenn A Walter, William D Rooney, Krista Vandenborne, Sarah Kim",2024
Progressive cardiomyopathy with intercalated disc disorganization in a rat model of Becker dystrophy.,"Becker muscular dystrophy (BMD) is an X-linked disorder due to in-frame mutations in the DMD gene, leading to a less abundant and truncated dystrophin. BMD is less common and severe than Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) as well as less investigated. To accelerate the search for innovative treatments, we developed a rat model of BMD by deleting the exons 45-47 of the Dmd gene. Here, we report a functional and histopathological evaluation of these rats during their first year of life, compared to DMD and control littermates. BMD rats exhibit moderate damage to locomotor and diaphragmatic muscles but suffer from a progressive cardiomyopathy. Single nuclei RNA-seq analysis of cardiac samples revealed shared transcriptomic abnormalities in BMD and DMD rats and highlighted an altered end-addressing of TMEM65 and Connexin-43 at the intercalated disc, along with electrocardiographic abnormalities. Our study documents the natural history of a translational preclinical model of BMD and reports a cellular mechanism for the cardiac dysfunction in BMD and DMD offering opportunities to further investigate the organization role of dystrophin in intercellular communication.","Valentina Taglietti, Kaouthar Kefi, Busra Mirciloglu, Sultan Bastu, Jean-Daniel Masson, Iwona Bronisz-Budzyńska, Vassiliki Gouni, Carlotta Ferri, Alan Jorge, Christel Gentil, France Pietri-Rouxel, Edoardo Malfatti, Peggy Lafuste, Laurent Tiret, Frederic Relaix",2024

Deletion of exons 45 to 55 in the DMD gene: from the therapeutic perspective to the in vitro model.,"Gene editing therapies in development for correcting out-of-frame DMD mutations in Duchenne muscular dystrophy aim to replicate benign spontaneous deletions. Deletion of 45-55 DMD exons (del45-55) was described in asymptomatic subjects, but recently serious skeletal and cardiac complications have been reported. Uncovering why a single mutation like del45-55 is able to induce diverse phenotypes and grades of severity may impact the strategies of emerging therapies. Cellular models are essential for this purpose, but their availability is compromised by scarce muscle biopsies.","Javier Poyatos-García, Patricia Soblechero-Martín, Alessandro Liquori, Andrea López-Martínez, Pilar Maestre, Elisa González-Romero, Rafael P Vázquez-Manrique, Nuria Muelas, Gema García-García, Jessica Ohana, Virginia Arechavala-Gomeza, Juan J Vílchez",2024

Development of an ultrasound-based metric of muscle functional capacity for use in patients with neuromuscular disease.,"Spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) and Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) are progressive neuromuscular disorders characterized by severe muscle weakness and functional decline (Pillen et al., Muscle Nerve 2008; 37(6):679-693). With new therapeutics, objective methods with increased sensitivity are needed to assess muscle function. Ultrasound imaging is a promising approach for assessing muscle fat and fibrosis in neuromuscular disorders. This study builds on prior work by combining ultrasound-based measurements of muscle size, shape, and quality, relating these measures to muscle strength, and proposing a multivariable image-based estimate of muscle function.","Allison N McCrady, Chelsea D Masterson, Laura E Barnes, Rebecca J Scharf, Silvia S Blemker",2024
Predictors of cardiac disease in duchenne muscular dystrophy: a systematic review and evidence grading.,Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is a rare disease that causes progressive muscle degeneration resulting in life-threatening cardiac complications. The objective of this systematic literature review was to describe and grade the published evidence of predictors of cardiac disease in DMD.,"Erik Landfeldt, Alberto Alemán, Sophia Abner, Rongrong Zhang, Christian Werner, Ioannis Tomazos, Hanns Lochmüller, Ros M Quinlivan, Karim Wahbi",2024
