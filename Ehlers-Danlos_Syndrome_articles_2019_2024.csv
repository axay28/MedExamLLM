"Cardiovascular, autonomic symptoms and quality of life in children with hypermobile Ehlers-Danlos syndrome.","Hypermobile Ehlers-Danlos syndrome is a connective tissue disorder characterized by joint hypermobility and other systemic manifestations. Cardiovascular, autonomic symptoms and dysautonomia are frequently reported in adults with hypermobile Ehlers-Danlos syndrome and have been shown to have a negative impact on quality of life. However, there is scant literature on autonomic symptoms in pediatric patients with hypermobile Ehlers-Danlos syndrome. This study aims to characterize cardiovascular symptoms and diagnoses in pediatric patients with hypermobile Ehlers-Danlos syndrome and evaluate the impact of autonomic symptoms on quality of life.","Amanda K Hertel, William R Black, Ashley Lytch, Emily Cramer, Lindsey Malloy Walton, Jordan T Jones",2024

Defining a core outcome set for hypermobility spectrum disorders and hypermobile Ehlers-Danlos syndrome: A Delphi consensus study.,"The reported prevalence of hypermobility spectrum disorders (HSD) and hypermobile Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome (hEDS) is unclear due to complex presentations and lack of awareness amongst professionals, contributing to diagnostic and management uncertainties. Standardising an outcome measure to assess symptoms most important to patients should help determine the impact of interventions. This Delphi study aims to reach a consensus with stakeholders on the core outcome set for children and adults with HSD/hEDS. A three-round modified Delphi consensus study with a follow-up consensus meeting was used. Stakeholder groups consisted of (1) individuals with HSD/hEDS; (2) family/friends/carers and (3) healthcare professionals. Participants could belong to more than one stakeholder group. They rated 74 symptoms using a 9-point Likert scale: 1 ""not important to 9 ""critically important"". Symptoms achieving a consensus rating of ≥ 70.0% critical importance across all groups were included. In Round 1, 766 responses were received from 600 participants, reducing to 566 responses from 438 participants by Round 3, with 53 participating in the consensus meeting. Overall, 30 symptoms met the ≥ 70.0% critically important threshold to be included in the final core outcome set. These were categorised under the specialties of musculoskeletal and orthopaedics, social, pain, gynaecology and urology, negative affect, neurological, gastrointestinal and ""other"". This study is the first to identify by consensus the core outcome set to be measured for patients with HSD/hEDS. The importance of these outcomes was confirmed by individuals living with the condition, their family, friends, carers and relevant healthcare professionals. Trial registration: IRAS ID: 326,855; East Midlands - Leicester South REC (reference: 23/EM/0143); Protocol registered with the COMET Initiative. Key Points • There is a lack of standardised outcome measure for HSD/hEDS research studies due to the heterogeneity of symptom presentations. • Symptoms across musculoskeletal and orthopaedics, social, pain, gynaecology and urology, negative affect, neurological, gastrointestinal and ""other"" specialties were identified as the core outcome set defined as ≥ 70.0% critically important to measure for individuals with HSD/hEDS. • There were a significant number of symptoms, widely recognised in the literature to be comorbid to HSD/hEDS, that reached a critical importance threshold of 50.0-69.9%, restricting the core outcome set to only those that met 70% or above may be limiting.","Natalie L Clark, Melissa Johnson, Amar Rangan, Lucksy Kottam, Andrea Hogarth, Sarah Scott, Katherine Swainston",2024

Spontaneous Bilateral Patellar Tendon Rupture in Patient with Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome: A Case Report.,"Bilateral spontaneous patellar tendon ruptures are rare, though it is hypothesized to be more common in patients with risk factors such as connective tissue disorders such as Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (EDS), systemic disorders weakening collagen structures, chronic stress around the patellar tendon, medications, and obesity or sedentary lifestyles. Clinicians should maintain a high degree of clinical suspicion for concerning features on clinical examination and radiological investigations to facilitate prompt diagnosis and operative management. This case report describes the first documented case of an adult patient with EDS who sustained bilateral spontaneous patellar tendon ruptures. There is one previously reported acute bilateral patellar tendon rupture occurring in a pediatric patient with EDS. Within the adult literature, two case reports have reported patients with EDS: One acute unilateral patellar tendon rupture who underwent operative management and one chronic patellar tendon tear requiring reconstruction 2.5 years following initial end-to-end repair.","Helena Franco, David Fraser",2024
[Gastrointestinal involvement in Ehlers-Danlos syndrome: A case series and systematic review].,"<b>Objective:</b> To explore the clinical and genetic characteristics of patients with Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (EDS) and gastrointestinal involvement. <b>Methods:</b> We retrospectively collected the clinical data of patients with EDS and gastrointestinal involvement from the electronic medical records at Peking Union Medical College Hospital (PUMCH) from January 2003 to September 2023. Additionally, we conducted a systematic review by searching cases with EDS and gastrointestinal involvement in PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, and the Cochrane Library databases from January 2000 to September 2023. <b>Results:</b> Ninety-four patients with EDS and gastrointestinal involvement were retrieved, including five patients from PUMCH and 89 patients from 80 published articles. The average age of patients was (29±14) years. The most common manifestation of gastrointestinal involvement was gastrointestinal perforation (<i>n</i>=46, 48.9%), followed by functional gastrointestinal symptoms (<i>n</i>=33, 35.1%), and digestive arterial disorders (<i>n</i>=10, 10.6%). The most common clinical subtype was vascular-EDS (vEDS) (<i>n=</i>50, 53.2%) followed by hypermobile-EDS (hEDS) (<i>n</i>=20, 21.3%). The most frequent genetic mutation occurred in the COL3A1 gene (<i>n=</i>30, 31.9%). Among patients with vEDS, gastrointestinal manifestations included gastrointestinal perforation (<i>n=</i>33, 66.0%), arterial lesions (<i>n=</i>9, 18.0%), and functional gastrointestinal symptoms (<i>n=</i>7, 14.0%). Among patients with hEDS, gastrointestinal manifestations included functional gastrointestinal symptoms (<i>n</i>=18, 90.0%), visceral prolapse (<i>n</i>=3, 15.0%) and intestinal volvulus (<i>n</i>=1, 5.0%). <b>Conclusions:</b> The most common subtypes of gastrointestinal involvement in EDS were vEDS and hEDS. Patients with hEDS mainly presented with functional gastrointestinal symptoms, whereas those with vEDS primarily showed gastrointestinal perforation and digestive arterial disorders.","Y P Shao, S Q Pan, Y Li, J Li, X Q Li",2024

Recent Global Trends and Hotspots in Occipitocervical Fusion: A Bibliometric Analysis and Visualization Study.,"Occipitocervical arthrodesis has a variety of indications to treat craniocervical and atlantoaxial pathologies for which a selective cervical fusion would not provide sufficient stability. Over time, the indications for occipitocervical fusions (OCF) have evolved, as new technologies and surgical techniques were developed. In this bibliometric analysis, we aim to explore the progression of OCF literature over time, analyzing the trends in publications and citations, publishing countries and authors, keywords and topics. The Web of Science database was used for data retrieval on July 3<sup>rd</sup>, 2024, with the search ""occipitocervical fusion"" OR ""occipito-cervical fusion"" OR ""occipitocervical arthrodesis"" OR ""occipital cervical fusion"" OR ""occipital cervical arthrodesis"" OR (""OCF"" AND ""spine surgery""). Excel was used to create the citation analysis and publication trend figures, along with the publishing countries and author analysis. The bibliometric software VosViewer was used to generate the keyword co-occurrence network visualizations. Overall, 762 articles were extracted. The number of pertinent publications and citations increased until 2020 before beginning to decrease. We found that Ehlers Danlos syndrome (EDS) has become a more prevalent topic, as the association between EDS and craniocervical instability has received further scrutiny. ""Dysphagia"" continues to be a commonly cited topic, while, conversely, rheumatoid arthritis has decreased in publication frequency, possibly related to advances in medical management and surgical techniques. Overall, the United States of America, China, and Japan are the top publishing countries. This analysis of OCF literature provides a helpful overview of emerging trends and clinician concerns, especially as seen through the perspective of time.","Anna Gorbacheva, Clifford Pierre, Julius Gerstmeyer, Donald David Davis, Bryan G Anderson, Tara Heffernan, Luke Jouppi, Zeyad Daher, Arash Tabesh, Stephen Lockey, Amir Abdul-Jabbar, Rod Oskouian, Jens R Chapman",2024
Oral health-related quality of life among women with temporomandibular disorders and hypermobile Ehlers-Danlos syndrome or hypermobility spectrum disorder.,"People with hypermobile Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (hEDS) or hypermobility spectrum disorders (HSDs) are at greater risk of developing temporomandibular disorders (TMDs), perhaps due to the general joint hypermobility. There is, however, no information on how oral health-related quality of life (OHRQoL) is affected in people with hEDS or HSD with TMD. The authors' aim was to assess OHRQoL via the 14-item, short version Oral Health Impact Profile (OHIP-14), as well as associated risk factors in women with TMD symptoms and confirmed hEDS or HSD.","Negin Yekkalam, Kirsi Sipilä, Mehmed Novo, Daniel Reissmann, Marcel Hanisch, Ole Oelerich",2024
"Exercise, Sports Participation, and Quality of Life in Young Patients with Heritable Thoracic Aortic Disease.","Patients with heritable thoracic aortic disease (HTAD)are often restricted from sports and certain types of exercise. This study was designed to investigate the effect of lifetime exercise exposure and competitive sports participation on quality of life (QOL) in patients aged 15-35 with syndromic [Marfan syndrome (MFS), Loeys-Dietz syndrome (LDS), vascular Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (vEDS)] and non-syndromic heritable thoracic aortic disease (nsHTAD).","Theodore J Millette, Randy K Ramcharitar, Oliver J Monfredi, Matthew J Thomas, Mark R Conaway, Peter N Dean",2024
Pulmonary <i>Mycobacterium avium</i> complex infection with vascular Ehlers-Danlos syndrome: A case report.,"A female patient developed multiple intestinal perforations at 31 and 43 years of age. Because of her family history of pneumothorax and intestinal perforation, Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (EDS) was suspected when she visited our hospital at 52 years. She was diagnosed with vascular Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (vEDS) and developed bilateral external iliac artery dissection. A CT scan at the time of admission revealed granular and infiltrative shadows in both lungs with bronchiectasis. The patient was also diagnosed with <i>Mycobacterium avium</i> complex (MAC) pulmonary disease, and drug susceptibility to clarithromycin was confirmed. After treatments with rifampicin, ethambutol, and clarithromycin were started, the acid-fast bacilli cultures taken from sputum were negative, and respiratory symptoms partially improved after about 1 month. vEDS is reportedly associated with lung diseases, such as pneumothorax and cystic lung lesions, but there are few reports of respiratory infections with vEDS. Moreover, there are no reports of complications associated with MAC disease. We report a case of vEDS with rare complications and suggest the possible mechanism of infection.","Ken Okamura, Rintaro Noro, Toru Tanaka, Takeru Kashiwada, Yosuke Tanaka, Yoshinobu Saito, Kazue Fujita, Koichi Akutsu, Tomoko Sahara, Koichiro Kamio, Takeshi Yamada, Kazuo Kasahara, Masahiro Seike",2024
Syndromic scoliosis in a patient with arthrochalasia Ehlers-Danlos syndrome corrected with a Wood-Rigo-Cheneau derotational brace.,"We present a boy in middle childhood with a medical history of arthrochalasiaEhlers-Danlos syndrome who was diagnosed with scoliosis as a toddler. His treatment began at a regional children's hospital, where initial spine radiographs demonstrated a 43.6° dextroscoliosis curve with the apex at L3. He was initially treated with a Boston brace, and the family was informed that MAGEC (Magnetic Expansion Control) growing rods were likely the definitive treatment due to the high likelihood of progression given the patient's large Cobb angle. However, the decision was made by the family and the Ehlers-Danlos syndrome specialist to proceed with the Wood-Rigo-Cheneau derotational brace.","Michael Brown, Leighann Krasney, Mark Lavallee",2024
Complex trauma sequelae: Mycobacterium goodii and Priestia endophytica Hardware infection in a patient with Ehlers-Danlos syndrome.,"A 26-year-old man with Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, recurrent otitis externa, and chronic otitis media sustained a left lower extremity amputation and open femur fracture with internal hardware fixation after a motor vehicle collision in Arizona. He presented to the emergency department at our institution with severe left leg pain and purulent discharge despite receiving two unidentified antibiotics upon discharge. Evaluations revealed an abscess and malunion of the femur. Initial cultures yielded scant Priestia endophytica, leading to daptomycin treatment. His condition worsened until Gram-positive bacilli identified as Mycobacterium goodii, a rare nosocomial mycobacterial species, were found. Significant improvement occurred with appropriate antibiotics. This case highlights the challenges in diagnosing and managing M. goodii infections in immunocompromised patients with orthopedic complications and notes P. endophytica as a previously unreported, possibly opportunistic human pathogen.","Andrea L Covington, Filipe M Cerqueira, Jonathan E Pavia, David Reynoso, Ping Ren",2024
Assessing the Utility of a Patient-Facing Diagnostic Tool Among Individuals With Hypermobile Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome: Focus Group Study.,"Hypermobile Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (hEDS), characterized by joint hypermobility, skin laxity, and tissue fragility, is thought to be the most common inherited connective tissue disorder, with millions affected worldwide. Diagnosing this condition remains a challenge that can impact quality of life for individuals with hEDS. Many with hEDS describe extended diagnostic odysseys involving exorbitant time and monetary investment. This delay is due to the complexity of diagnosis, symptom overlap with other conditions, and limited access to providers. Many primary care providers are unfamiliar with hEDS, compounded by genetics clinics that do not accept referrals for hEDS evaluation and long waits for genetics clinics that do evaluate for hEDS, leaving patients without sufficient options.","Jessica Goehringer, Abigail Kosmin, Natalie Laible, Katrina Romagnoli",2024

Functional benefit of joint surgery in patients with non-vascular Ehlers-Danlos syndrome: results of a retrospective study.,"Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (EDS) is a hereditary disease characterised by joint hypermobility, skin hyperextensibility and tissue fragility. Hypermobile EDS (hEDS is the more frequent subtype. Joint surgery may benefit certain patients after failure of medical treatments, but there is no consensus on the optimal surgical management of patients with hEDS. The aims of this retrospective study were to chart the surgical management of patients with hEDS, to determine the role of arthroscopy and to evaluate the functional results of joint surgery, including the reintervention rates.","Sharon Abihssira, Karelle Benistan, Geoffroy Nourissat",2024

Coexisting Sacroiliac Arthritis and Chronic Nonbacterial Osteomyelitis in an Adolescent with Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome: A Case Report and Treatment Success.,"BACKGROUND Chronic nonbacterial osteomyelitis (CNO) is a multifocal autoinflammatory bone disease mainly affecting children and adolescents. Sacroiliitis is an inflammation of the sacroiliac joint, diagnosed with the use of musculoskeletal MRI due to its ability to visualize active inflammatory lesions. Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (EDS) is non-inflammatory hereditary disorder of connective tissue. Here, we report the case of a 17.5-year-old female patient with classical EDS and long-term course of the CNO with coexistence of sacroiliac arthritis. CASE REPORT On admission, a patient with CNO reported pain in the scapula, thoracic spine, shoulders, and iliac region, with morning stiffness present for 5 months. Physical examination revealed knee and elbow joint hyperextension, hypermobility of the phalanges, increased range of motion of the hip joints, and the presence of reticular rash on the face. In the laboratory blood tests, minor leukocytosis was reported. During hospitalization, a whole-body MRI was performed, detecting bone marrow edema in the Th3, Th4, and Th7 vertebral bodies and the head of seventh rib on the left side, as well as bilaterally in the sacroiliac joints. The patient was diagnosed with sacroiliitis and EDS and successfully treated with risedronate sodium, methotrexate with folic acid, sulfasalazine, and meloxicam, achieving CNO remission and reduced severity of axial skeleton pain. CONCLUSIONS The coexistence of these 3 diseases - CNO, sacroiliac arthritis, and EDS - in the same patient is rare and requires interphysician collaboration to determine the correct diagnosis and subsequently arrange multi-speciality therapeutic management to achieve remission.","Joanna Ożga, Elżbieta Mężyk, Wojciech Kmiecik, Wadim Wojciechowski, Zbigniew Żuber",2024

Long COVID and hypermobility spectrum disorders have shared pathophysiology.,"Hypermobility spectrum disorders (HSD) and hypermobile Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (hEDS) are the most common joint hypermobility conditions encountered by physicians, with hypermobile and classical EDS accounting for >90% of all cases. Hypermobility has been detected in up to 30-57% of patients with myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS), fibromyalgia, postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome (POTS), and long COVID (LC) compared to the general population. Extrapulmonary symptoms, including musculoskeletal pain, dysautonomia disorders, cognitive disorders, and fatigue, are seen in both LC and HSD. Additionally, ME/CFS has overlapping symptoms with those seen in HSD. Mast cell activation and degranulation occurring in both LC and ME/CFS may result in hyperinflammation and damage to connective tissue in these patients, thereby inducing hypermobility. Persistent inflammation may result in the development or worsening of HSD. Hence, screening for hypermobility and other related conditions including fibromyalgia, POTS, ME/CFS, chronic pain conditions, joint pain, and myalgia is essential for individuals experiencing LC. Pharmacological treatments should be symptom-focused and geared to a patient's presentation. Paced exercise, massage, yoga, and meditation may also provide benefits.","Ravindra Ganesh, Bala Munipalli",2024
Cerebral air embolism associated with cavitary lung lesion in a patient with Ehlers-Danlos syndrome.,"Pneumocephalus, is a general term describing the presence of air within the intracranial structures. It most commonly occurs due to dural injury, often the sequela of head trauma or surgery. More infrequently, nontraumatic pneumocephalus can be related to infection, Valsalva, fistulization between air-containing organs and intracranial structures, or vascular air embolism. While postsurgical pneumocephalus is often benign, serious consequences of pneumocephalus exist, including tension pneumocephalus and cerebral infarction. We present a case of air embolism and cerebral infarction in a patient with Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, found to have large cavitary lesion in the left upper lobe of the lung, with associated pulmonary vascular malformation seen on bronchoscopy. To our knowledge this is the first reported case of air embolism associated with a pulmonary cavitary lesion and vascular malformation, in a patient with Ehlers-Danlos syndrome.","Joshua Mangerel, Daniel Masri, Marshall Gelbman",2024
Complication Avoidance in Chiari Malformation Surgery.,"Posterior fossa decompression for symptomatic Chiari malformation is an effective and frequently performed procedure, but it does carry risks of significant complications including cerebrospinal fluid leak and craniocervical instability. Patients sometimes do not improve or worsen after decompression, which may discourage neurosurgeons from performing Chiari decompression surgery. In this chapter, management strategies and surgical approaches are discussed that minimize the risks of complications and maximize favorable outcomes in Chiari malformation surgery.",Holly S Gilmer,2024
Musculoskeletal Issues in Children and Adolescents: Genetic Musculoskeletal Disorders.,"Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is an X-linked recessive genetic disorder with progressive proximal weakness as the principal sign. Glucocorticoids and physical therapy are the mainstay of treatment. Exercise intolerance is the hallmark of metabolic myopathies, which require a combination of laboratory testing, electrodiagnostic testing, and muscle biopsy for diagnosis. Joint hypermobility may be an isolated finding or be associated with hypermobility Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (EDS), other variants of EDS, or marfanoid syndromes. The latter conditions are associated with aortic and cardiac valvular abnormalities. Osteogenesis imperfecta encompasses a group of disorders characterized by bone fragility presenting with a low-impact fracture as a result of minimal trauma. Management includes multidiscipline specialists. Down syndrome (DS), or trisomy 21, is the most common chromosome abnormality identified in live births. Routine evaluation of atlantoaxial instability with x-ray is no longer recommended for children with DS without symptoms of atlantoaxial instability; however, clinical evaluation of symptoms is required for sports preparticipation. Achondroplasia is the most common skeletal dysplasia. Clinical signs are macrocephaly, short limb, short stature with disproportionately shorter humerus and femur, along with characteristic findings in pelvis and lumbar spine x-rays. Caregivers should be educated on proper positioning and handling to avoid complications, including car seat-related deaths.","Francis G O'Connor, Jeffrey C Leggit",2024

Musculocontractural Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome Leading to Hemorrhagic Shock From Giant Subcutaneous Hematoma: A Case Report.,"The patient was a six-year-old boy with a history of musculocontractural Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (mcEDS). He presented to the emergency department after falling on the road the day before admission, which led to an increase in subcutaneous hematoma in his left lower leg and brief syncope. Initial blood tests revealed a decreased hemoglobin level of 8.1 g/dL (normal range: 14 g/dL). Contrast-enhanced CT showed a massive subcutaneous and intermuscular hematoma in the left thigh. He was diagnosed with hemorrhagic shock due to this extensive hemorrhage and was admitted to the ICU. The affected area was elevated, and hemostasis was achieved through compression. The swelling gradually improved, and he was discharged from the hospital on day 13 after admission. EDS is a systemic condition caused by genetic mutations affecting collagen and collagen-modifying enzymes. mcEDS is an extremely rare variant with a recently identified causative gene, characterized by abnormal connective tissue development and progressive fragility. Giant subcutaneous hematomas resulting from tissue fragility are serious complications of this disease, often occurring with minor trauma and sometimes leading to gradual hemorrhagic shock. Desmopressin nasal drops can be effective in preventing such hematomas. It is crucial to consider the risk of hemorrhagic shock from subcutaneous hemorrhage in patients with mcEDS, especially when repeated subcutaneous hematomas of unknown origin are observed.","Yoshiki Uemura, Norihiko Tsuboi, Satoshi Nakagawa",2024
An overview of Ehlers Danlos syndrome and the link between postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome and gastrointestinal symptoms with a focus on gastroparesis.,"There has been an increasingly reported association between Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (EDS), postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome (POTS) and gastrointestinal disorders. EDS is a hereditary connective tissue disorder which may manifest as a spectrum of symptoms stemming from collagen defects. The prevalence of EDS is estimated to affect 1 in 5000 individuals which underscores its clinical significance. Notably the hypermobile form (hEDS) accounts for the majority of cases. POTS is characterized by orthostatic intolerance with an increase in heart rate on standing in the absence of hypotension. This condition predominantly affects women between 15 and 45 years of age. Gastrointestinal symptoms in the form of reflux, bloating and abdominal pain significant impact this population. Gastroparesis is a chronic disorder involving symptoms of delayed gastric emptying and may be closely associated with hEDS and POTS, and may be underreported. Autonomic dysfunction associated with hEDS has been proposed as the likely mechanism underlying POTS and gastrointestinal dysfunction though a clear pathophysiological process has not been established.","William Wu, Vincent Ho",2024
Genetic disorders in maternal medicine.,"The role of genetic testing within maternal medicine is expanding. Advancing technology and the increasing availability of genetic testing have seen more patients receiving a genetic diagnosis than ever before. Improved healthcare and understanding of these rare diseases means that many patients are living well into their reproductive years and starting families. Individual diseases are considered by their patterns of inheritance i.e. autosomal recessive, autosomal dominant and chromosomal diseases. This chapter specifically addresses the following examples and outlines an approach to pre-conceptual and pregnancy management; autosomal recessive (cystic fibrosis, phenylketonuria), autosomal dominant (osteogenesis imperfecta, vascular Ehlers-Danlos syndrome) and chromosomal (Turner syndrome). For many rare and ultrarare genetic diseases, there may be no clear guidelines or consensus on the correct management in pregnancy. This chapter seeks to provide a framework for the clinician to use to address the unique needs and risk profile of these patients in pregnancy and pre-conceptually and plan accordingly. The role of pharmacogenetics in maternal medicine, the future of education in genetics for patients and clinicians and the important role of genetic counselling are all considered in this chapter. This overview highlights the important role of genetics in maternal medicine and how this can inform management and planning for the safe care of mother and baby.","Maggie O'Brien, Sinead Whyte, Sam Doyle, Fionnuala M McAuliffe",2024
Modulating the extracellular matrix to treat wound healing defects in Ehlers-Danlos syndrome.,"Classic Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (cEDS) is a genetic disorder of the connective tissue that is characterized by mutations in genes coding type V collagen. Wound healing defects are characteristic of cEDS and no therapeutic strategies exist. Herein we describe a murine model of cEDS that phenocopies wound healing defects seen in humans. Our model features mice with conditional loss of <i>Col5a1</i> in <i>Col1a2</i> <sup>+</sup> fibroblasts (Col5a1CKO). This model shows that an abnormal extracellular matrix (ECM) characterized by fibrillar disarray, altered mechanical properties, and decreased collagen deposition contribute to the wound healing defect. The cEDS animals exhibit decreased expression of epidermal genes and increased inflammation. Finally, we demonstrate that inhibiting mechanosensitive integrin signaling or by injecting wild-type (WT) fibroblasts into cEDS animals enhances epidermal gene expression, decreases inflammation, and augments wound closure. These findings suggest that cell delivery and/or blocking integrin signaling are potentially therapeutic strategies to rescue wound healing defects in cEDS.","Kindra M Kelly-Scumpia, Maani M Archang, Prabhat K Purbey, Tomohiro Yokota, Rimao Wu, Jackie McCourt, Shen Li, Rachelle H Crosbie, Philip O Scumpia, Arjun Deb",2024
Systemic Factors Affecting Orthodontic Treatment Outcomes and Prognosis - Part 1.,"This article explores the intersection of various systemic conditions with orthodontic treatment. Renal diseases, including chronic kidney disease and renal transplant, present challenges such as delayed tooth eruption and gingival overgrowth, necessitating careful orthodontic planning and collaboration with physicians. Liver diseases, particularly hepatitis, heighten the risk of periodontal disease and mandate strict infection control measures during orthodontic procedures. Ehlers-Danlos syndrome poses challenges related to collagen fragility, rapid tooth movement, and orthodontic relapse. Autoimmune diseases like diabetes mellitus and juvenile idiopathic arthritis require tailored orthodontic approaches considering oral complications and joint involvement.","Sumit Gupta, Anil Ardeshna, Paul Emile Rossouw, Manish Valiathan",2024
