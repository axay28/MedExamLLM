Long-term enzyme replacement therapy in Fabry patients protects against oxidative and inflammatory process.,"Fabry disease (FD) is an X-linked recessive lysosomal storage disorder, characterized by a deficiency of α-galactosidase, which causes the progressive accumulation of glycosphingolipids, especially globotriaosylsphingosine (Gb3), in lysosomes across multiple organs. Substrate deposition, associated with tissue damage in FD, also contributes to the emergence of a pro-inflammatory state presented by some patients. We investigated pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines, and the expression of inflammation-associated genes in treated FD patients, as well as oxidative parameters. We found a decrease in the production of cytokines IL-1β, IL-6, IL-10, and TNF-α in male FD patients and a normalization of redox status in male and female FD patients, once the levels of protein, lipid oxidation, and nitrite and nitrate content were like healthy individuals. Our results suggest that long-term ERT in men with FD contributes to the reduction of a pro-inflammatory scenario and a decrease of oxidative damage in patients, reflecting greater control throughout the disease and in the multisystemic changes characteristic of this disorder. These findings lead us to believe that long-term ERT can improve the redox status and protect these individuals against oxidative and nitrative stress, as well as the inflammatory process.","Alana Pimentel Moura, Tatiane Grazieli Hammerschmidt, Gilian Guerreiro, Camila Aguilar, Jéssica Lamberty Faverzani, Franciele Fátima Lopes, Fabiano de Oliveira Poswar, Roberto Giugliani, Marion Deon, Carmen Regla Vargas",2024
Comparative pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of two formulations of agalsidase beta (agalsidase Biosidus) and Fabrazyme® by intravenous infusion in healthy male volunteers.,"Fabry disease is a rare X-linked lysosomal condition that leads to the accumulation of glycosphingolipids in various tissues, causing cellular dysfunction, tissue remodeling, progressive fibrosis, and organ failure. The disease results from a deficiency in the human α-galactosidase A enzyme, responsible for breaking down glycosphingolipids like globotriaosylceramide (GL-3 or Gb3) into galactose and dihexose ceramides. In individuals diagnosed with Fabry disease, treatment from 2 years of age onwards typically involves agalsidase beta, the normal recombinant form of the defective enzyme. Agalsidase beta from Biosidus has been developed as a biosimilar to Sanofi-Genzyme's Fabrazyme®. In the molecule's clinical journey, a phase I trial was designed to establish its similarity in terms of pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, and immunogenicity compared to the reference medication. The study was conducted on 24 healthy male volunteers, aged between 18 and 40 years. All volunteers received a single 1 mg/kg bw dose of Fabrazyme® or Biosidus Agalsidase beta by continuous intravenous (IV) infusion over 5 h. The 90 % confidence interval (CI) of the maximum concentration (Cmax), area under the plasma concentration-time curve from time 0 to 12 h (AUC0-12 h) and area under the plasma concentration-time curve extrapolated from time 0 to infinity (AUC0-∞) ratios fell within the accepted range of 80-125 %. No differences were detected in adverse effects or antibody induction. This indicates that Biosidus agalsidase beta meets the criteria for being considered similar to the reference formulation Sanofi Genzyme's Fabrazyme®.","Viridiana Berstein, Eduardo M Pirotzky, Hernán D Taconelli, M Gabriela Gobbi, Lara Beider, Natali D Salgueiro, Laila Dome, Roberto A Diez, Hugo Sotelo, Sabrina Coppola",2024
Quality of life and unmet needs in patients with fabry disease: a qualitative study.,"Patients with Fabry disease (FD) consider their quality of life to be significantly affected. The majority of studies evaluate the quality of life using quantitative measures and standardised scales that offer relevant information about experience with the disease in multiple aspects. The main objective of the research was to examine in depth the quality of life and unmet needs of patients diagnosed with FD in relation to their disease and treatment. A qualitative and transversal study was carried out in two stages: (a) nine semi-structured qualitative interviews with patients and one representative of the patient association, conducted individually by phone; (b) a focus group was set up with three patients diagnosed with FD and one relative. A deductive, thematic analysis approach was used for data coding and analysis.","Montserrat Morales, Jordi Cruz, Eduardo Brignani, Laura Acuña, Esther Lázaro, Cristina Soria",2024
Coexistence of Fabry Disease and Membranous Nephropathy: A Case Report.,"Fabry disease (FD) is a rare X-linked genetic disease that can coexist with multiple glomerulopathies. We report a 32-year-old female patient of FD coexisting with stage II membranous nephropathy (MN), who presented with proteinuria, normal renal function, and hypo-hidrosis as the only symptom. The renal biopsy manifested a subepithelial immunocomplex deposit in the glomeruli along with basement membrane thickening on light microscopy. Electron microscopy revealed myeloid bodies in some podocytes, which suggested the patient possibly coexistence with Fabry disease. The low activity of α-galactosidase A and one pathogenic heterozygous mutation (c.335G > Ap.Arg112His) in the α-galactosidase A gene confirmed the diagnosis of Fabry disease. This patient's son had the same gene mutation as his mother but without any symptoms at the time. Treatment with ramipril turned urine protein negative. The proteinuria had reoccurred, as shown by the presence of foamy urine, a protein to creatinine ratio of 1.54 g/g, and a blood albumin level of 34.4g/L. The patient was being treated with allisartan isoproxil. However, at the time, the urine protein did not turn negative.","Yan Jin, Li Pen, Lei Lan, Jun Jiang",2024

Patient with Fabry disease undergoing cardiac surgery: a word of caution.,"Fabry disease (FD) is a rare genetic disorder that affects various organs and systems in the body. The disease is caused by a deficiency in the lysosomal enzyme α-galactosidase A (AGAL), which leads to the accumulation of globotriaosylceramide (Gb3) within lysosomes. This accumulation can cause damage to cells and organ systems, leading to a wide range of symptoms and complications. FD is a heterogeneous disorder, with a wide range of clinical phenotypes, ranging from the classic form, which is severe and associated with early onset, to milder non-classical forms, which are often limited to one organ and manifest later in life. We describe the case of a 23-year-old FD patient who was admitted as an emergency transfer due to newly discovered severe aortic regurgitation and suspected aortic valve endocarditis with vegetations of high embolic potential. Three years ago, the patient underwent a living donor kidney transplantation-the kidney graft lost its function 1 year after transplantation, and a chronic hemodialysis program was reinstituted.","Jelena Vuckovic, Anastazija Stojsic Milosavljevic, Mirka Lukic-Sarkanovic, Dejan Celic, Ivana Stojanovic, Lazar Velicki",2024

Cardiovascular magnetic resonance insights into anomalies of the mitral valve apparatus in Fabry cardiomyopathy and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.,"Despite different etiopathogenesis, Fabry Disease cardiomyopathy (FDc) and sarcomeric hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) share a similar hypertrophic phenotype, including anomalies of the mitral valve apparatus (AMVA). Some of these anomalies have also been described in the pre-hypertrophic stage of both diseases. This cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) study aimed to: (i) compare AMVA between FDc and HCM with a similar degree of left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH), to add new insights into differential diagnosis; (ii) assess whether AMVA represent an early and progressive alteration in FDc; (iii) propose simple and potentially reproducible measurements of AMVA.","Lara Tondi, Giandomenico Disabato, Paolo D'Andria, Andrea Attanasio, Gianluigi Guida, Federico Pieruzzi, Giada De Angeli, Marco Canepa, Gianpaolo Carrafiello, Massimo Piepoli, Pietro Spagnolo, Massimo Lombardi, Antonia Camporeale",2024
In Silico Modeling of Fabry Disease Pathophysiology for the Identification of Early Cellular Damage Biomarker Candidates.,"Fabry disease (FD) is an X-linked lysosomal disease whose ultimate consequences are the accumulation of sphingolipids and subsequent inflammatory events, mainly at the endothelial level. The outcomes include different nervous system manifestations as well as multiple organ damage. Despite the availability of known biomarkers, early detection of FD remains a medical need. This study aimed to develop an in silico model based on machine learning to identify candidate vascular and nervous system proteins for early FD damage detection at the cellular level. A combined systems biology and machine learning approach was carried out considering molecular characteristics of FD to create a computational model of vascular and nervous system disease. A data science strategy was applied to identify risk classifiers by using 10 K-fold cross-validation. Further biological and clinical criteria were used to prioritize the most promising candidates, resulting in the identification of 36 biomarker candidates with classifier abilities, which are easily measurable in body fluids. Among them, we propose four candidates, CAMK2A, ILK, LMNA, and KHSRP, which have high classification capabilities according to our models (cross-validated accuracy ≥ 90%) and are related to the vascular and nervous systems. These biomarkers show promise as high-risk cellular and tissue damage indicators that are potentially applicable in clinical settings, although in vivo validation is still needed.","Javier Gervas-Arruga, Miguel Ángel Barba-Romero, Jorge Julián Fernández-Martín, Jorge Francisco Gómez-Cerezo, Cristina Segú-Vergés, Giacomo Ronzoni, Jorge J Cebolla",2024
NT-proBNP Reflects Left Ventricular Hypertrophy Rather than Left Ventricular Dilatation or Systolic Dysfunction in Patients with Fabry Disease.,"<b>Background</b>: The diagnosis and follow-up of cardiac involvement in Fabry disease constitutes an important challenge for clinicians caring for affected patients. Combining cardiac imaging with laboratory biomarkers appears most appropriate for longitudinal monitoring. Therefore, we examined the use of NT-proBNP and its association with imaging findings in patients with Fabry disease. <b>Methods</b>: We analysed cardiac MRI and echocardiography data, as well as laboratory results, from a single-centre prospective registry. <b>Results</b>: Repetitive follow-ups of 38 patients with Fabry disease, of whom 18 presented with left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH), revealed a correlation of NT-proBNP with left ventricular (LV) interventricular septal thickness, LV maximum wall thickness, LV and right ventricular (RV) mass index and trabecular mass in patients with LVH. Patients without LVH did not exhibit any tangible association between NT-proBNP and the mentioned parameters. Conversely, we could not detect an association of NT-proBNP with impairment of LV or RV ejection fraction or diastolic volume. <b>Conclusions</b>: NT-proBNP plays a pivotal role as a biomarker for cardiac involvement in patients with Fabry disease. Interestingly, in this specific population with mostly preserved ejection fraction, it seems to reflect ventricular hypertrophy rather than ventricular dysfunction or dilatation. While strong associations were found in hypertrophic patients, NT-proBNP's prognostic value appears limited in non- or pre-hypertrophic stages.","Constantin Gatterer, Dietrich Beitzke, Gere Sunder-Plassmann, Maximilian Friedl, Philipp Hohensinner, Christopher Mann, Markus Ponleitner, Senta Graf, Max Lenz",2024
Characterization of Fabry disease-associated lyso-Gb<sub>3</sub> on mouse colonic ion transport and motility.,"Fabry disease (FD) is a rare X-linked lysosomal storage disorder caused by a deficiency in α-galactosidase A leading to the accumulation of globotriaosylceramide (Gb<sub>3</sub>) and subsequent increase in globotriaosylsphingosine (lyso-Gb<sub>3</sub>) in different cells and organs, including the gastrointestinal (GI) tract. GI symptoms represent some of the earliest manifestations of FD and significantly impact quality of life. The origin of these symptoms is complex, and the exact mechanisms remain poorly understood. Here, we sought to determine whether lyso-Gb<sub>3</sub> contributes to the pathophysiology of GI symptoms associated with FD by examining its effects on mouse colonic ion transport and motility <i>ex vivo</i> using Ussing chambers and organ baths respectively. Lyso-Gb<sub>3</sub> significantly increased colonic baseline short-circuit current (I<sub>SC</sub>). This increase in I<sub>SC</sub> was insensitive to inhibition of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator and Na-K-Cl cotransporter 1 suggesting that the increase in I<sub>SC</sub> is Cl<sup>-</sup> ion independent. This response was also insensitive to inhibition with the neurotoxin, tetrodotoxin. Additionally, pretreatment with lyso-Gb<sub>3</sub> did not significantly influence subsequent responses to either veratridine or capsaicin implying that the response to lyso-Gb<sub>3</sub> does not involve the enteric nervous system. In terms of colonic motility, lyso-Gb<sub>3</sub> did not significantly influence colonic tone, spontaneous contractility or cholinergic-induced contractions. These data suggest that lyso-Gb<sub>3</sub>, significantly influences ion transport in mouse colon, but that accumulation of Gb<sub>3</sub> may be a pre-requisite for the more pronounced disturbances in GI physiology characteristic of FD.","Cecilia Delprete, Friederike Uhlig, Marco Caprini, Niall P Hyland",2024
Oncological Aspects of Lysosomal Storage Diseases.,"Lysosomal storage diseases (LSDs) are caused by the deficient activity of a lysosomal hydrolase or the lack of a functional membrane protein, transporter, activator, or other protein. Lysosomal enzymes break down macromolecular compounds, which contribute to metabolic homeostasis. Stored, undegraded materials have multiple effects on cells that lead to the activation of autophagy and apoptosis, including the toxic effects of lyso-lipids, the disruption of intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> ion homeostasis, the secondary storage of macromolecular compounds, the activation of signal transduction, apoptosis, inflammatory processes, deficiencies of intermediate compounds, and many other pathways. Clinical observations have shown that carriers of potentially pathogenic variants in LSD-associated genes and patients affected with some LSDs are at a higher risk of cancer, although the results of studies on the frequency of oncological diseases in LSD patients are controversial. Cancer is found in individuals affected with Gaucher disease, Fabry disease, Niemann-Pick type A and B diseases, alfa-mannosidosis, and sialidosis. Increased cancer prevalence has also been reported in carriers of a potentially pathogenic variant of an LSD gene, namely <i>CLN3</i>, <i>SGSH</i>, <i>GUSB</i>, <i>NEU1</i>, and, to a lesser extent, in other genes. In this review, LSDs in which oncological events can be observed are described.",Agnieszka Ługowska,2024
"Resistive index of central retinal artery, aortic arterial stiffness and OCTA correlated parameters in the early stage of fabry disease.","This study aimed to evaluate the impact of Fabry disease (FD) on retinal microvasculature using optical coherence tomography angiography (OCTA), arterial stiffness, and the resistive index (RI) of the central retinal artery (CRA) in early disease stages. Twenty-nine genetically confirmed FD patients and twenty-six healthy controls were enrolled. Vessel density (VD) values of the superficial, deep, and choriocapillaris plexuses (SCP, DCP, and CC) were measured via OCTA. CRA RI was studied using color Doppler and grayscale sonography, and aortic pulse wave velocity (PWV) was assessed with the Complior method. CRA RI was significantly lower in the control group compared to the Fabry group (p < 0.001). Central VD was found to be significantly higher in the control group compared to the Fabry group in all the retinal layers (SCP (p < 0.001), DCP (p < 0.005), CC (p < 0.001)). PWV was significantly higher in the Fabry group than in the control group (p = 0.03). Fabry disease patients demonstrate elevated arterial stiffness, increased CRA RI, and diminished retinal microvascular density compared to healthy controls, indicating early ocular damage. Continuous monitoring and targeted screening for organ impairment are crucial in FD management. Identifying biomarkers for assessing ocular vascular involvement and treatment response is imperative. Further research is needed.","Michele Rinaldi, Flavia Chiosi, Maria Laura Passaro, Francesco Natale, Alessia Riccardo, Luca D'Andrea, Martina Caiazza, Marta Rubino, Emanuele Monda, Gilda Cennamo, Francesco Calabrò, Giuseppe Limongelli, Ciro Costagliola",2024

Infrared spectroscopy as a new approach for early fabry disease screening: a pilot study.,"Fabry disease (FD) is a rare X-linked lysosomal storage disorder marked by alpha-galactosidase-A (α-Gal A) deficiency, caused by pathogenic mutations in the GLA gene, resulting in the accumulation of glycosphingolipids within lysosomes. The current screening test relies on measuring α-Gal A activity. However, this approach is limited to males. Infrared (IR) spectroscopy is a technique that can generate fingerprint spectra of a biofluid's molecular composition and has been successfully applied to screen numerous diseases. Herein, we investigate the discriminating vibration profile of plasma chemical bonds in patients with FD using attenuated total reflection Fourier-transform IR (ATR-FTIR) spectroscopy.","Carolina Teles Barretto, Márcia Helena Cassago Nascimento, Bruna Ferro Brun, Tiago Barcelos da Silva, Pedro Augusto Costa Dias, Cassiano Augusto Braga Silva, Maneesh N Singh, Francis L Martin, Paulo Roberto Filgueiras, Wanderson Romão, Luciene Cristina Gastalho Campos, Valerio Garrone Barauna",2024
Genetic principles related to neurocutaneous disorders.,"A detailed understanding of genetics is critical to the diagnosis, management, and prognostication of neurocutaneous disorders. Inheritance patterns can provide a key to the identification of different neurocutaneous disorders. Autosomal dominant disorders, like neurofibromatosis type 1 and tuberous sclerosis complex, affect males and females equally and are typically seen in every generation of a pedigree due to pathogenic changes to one copy of a gene on a somatic chromosome. Autosomal recessive disorders, such as ataxia-telangiectasia, affect males and females equally but typically skip generations on pedigrees as there needs to be a pathogenic variant of the gene on each of the pair of somatic chromosomes. X-linked disorders such as incontinentia pigmenti and Fabry disease primarily affect males or affect them more severely, but in the case of incontinentia pigmenti, the condition is lethal in males and only females are noted to be affected. The pathogenic variant that is disease causing is on the X sex chromosome, of which females have two and males have one. Somatic mosaic disorders like Sturge Weber syndrome are due to pathogenic variants only in a subset of cells post-fertilization and are not present in gametes, and so are not passed on to the next generation. Conditions that are a result of germline mosaicism are usually identified as autosomal dominant conditions that have not been present in the family prior to a single child being affected, with suspicion strengthening if siblings are diagnosed with the same condition. Regardless of the suspected inheritance pattern, it is essential to consider the ethical implications of genetic testing, including family planning, discovery of consanguinity, disclosure to other potentially affected family members, and diagnostic uncertainty.","Leah Ferrante, Chelsey Ortman",2024
The unlikely combination: Anderson-Fabry disease and congenital dyserythropoietic anemia type II in a pediatric patient.,"Anderson-Fabry disease, a rare X-linked lysosomal disorder, and congenital dyserythropoietic anemia (CDA) Type II, an autosomal recessive condition, both have distinct inheritance patterns. Their co-occurrence is extremely rare, never been reported before. Therefore, screening is crucial for early management, and families should seek genetic counseling for children showing unusual presentations.","Yasmine Elsherif, Ismail A Ibrahim, Omar Elsherif, Hana J Abukhadijah",2024
The contribution of the sphingosine 1-phosphate signaling pathway to chronic kidney diseases: recent findings and new perspectives.,"Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a multifactorial condition with diverse etiologies, such as diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and genetic disorders, often culminating in end-stage renal disease (ESRD). A hallmark of CKD progression is kidney fibrosis, characterized by the excessive accumulation of extracellular matrix components, for which there is currently no effective anti-fibrotic therapy. Recent literature highlights the critical role of sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P) signaling in CKD pathogenesis and renal fibrosis. This review provides an in-depth analysis of the latest findings on S1P metabolism and signaling in renal fibrosis and in specific CKDs, including diabetic nephropathy (DN), lupus nephritis (LN), focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS), Fabry disease (FD), and IgA nephropathy (IgAN). Emerging studies underscore the therapeutic potential of modulating S1P signaling with receptor modulators and inhibitors, such as fingolimod (FTY720) and more selective agents like ozanimod and cenerimod. Additionally, the current knowledge about the effects of established kidney protective therapies such as glucocorticoids and SGLT2 and ACE inhibitors on S1P signaling will be summarized. Furthermore, the review highlights the potential role of S1P as a biomarker for disease progression in CKD models, particularly in Fabry disease and diabetic nephropathy. Advanced technologies, including spatial transcriptomics, are further refining our understanding of S1P's role within specific kidney compartments. Collectively, these insights emphasize the need for continued research into S1P signaling pathways as promising targets for CKD treatment strategies.","Stephanie Schwalm, Roxana Manaila, Anke Oftring, Liliana Schaefer, Stephan von Gunten, Josef Pfeilschifter",2024
[Lysosomal storage disorders - Fabry disease and Gaucher disease].,"Lysosomal storage disorders (LSD) are a heterogenous group of inborn errors of metabolism due to lysosomal malfunction. LSDs affect 1 in 5000 live births, albeit every LSD itself has a low incidence. The most common LSDs are Fabry disease and Gaucher disease. The underlying cause mainly is an enzyme deficiency but may also be due to defects in transport or activation proteins, which result in progressive intra- and extra-lysosomal accumulation of undegraded storage material. The lysosomes play a key role in degradation and cellular recycling of macromolecules. Besides disturbance of cellular function, substrate accumulation may result in secondary toxic and/or inflammatory processes. For treatment of Fabry and Gaucher disease, several therapeutic approaches are approved including enzyme replacement therapy, chaperon therapy for Fabry disease and substrate reduction therapy for Gaucher disease.","Lucia Segura Schmitz, Julia B Hennermann, André Lollert",2024
"A phase III, open-label clinical trial evaluating pegunigalsidase alfa administered every 4 weeks in adults with Fabry disease previously treated with other enzyme replacement therapies.","Pegunigalsidase alfa, a PEGylated α-galactosidase A enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) for Fabry disease, has a longer plasma half-life than other ERTs administered intravenously every 2 weeks (E2W). BRIGHT (NCT03180840) was a phase III, open-label study in adults with Fabry disease, previously treated with agalsidase alfa or beta E2W for ≥3 years, who switched to 2 mg/kg pegunigalsidase alfa every 4 weeks (E4W) for 52 weeks. Primary objective assessed safety, including number of treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs). Thirty patients were enrolled (24 males); 23 previously received agalsidase beta. Pegunigalsidase alfa plasma concentrations remained above the lower limit of quantification throughout the 4-week dosing interval. Thirty-three of 182 TEAEs (in 9 patients) were considered treatment-related; all were mild/moderate. No patients developed de novo anti-drug antibodies (ADAs). In the efficacy analysis (n = 29), median (inter-quartile range) eGFR change from baseline over 52 weeks was -1.9 (-5.9; 1.8) mL/min/1.73 m<sup>2</sup> (n = 28; males [n = 22]: -2.4 [-5.2; 3.2]; females [n = 6]: -0.7 [-9.2; 2.0]). Overall, median eGFR slope was -1.9 (-8.3; 1.9) mL/min/1.73 m<sup>2</sup>/year (ADA-negative [n = 20]: -1.2 [-6.4; 2.6]; ADA-positive [n = 9]: -8.4 [-11.6; -1.0]). Lyso-Gb3 concentrations were low and stable in females, with a slight increase in males (9/24 ADA-positive). The BRIGHT study results suggest that 2 mg/kg pegunigalsidase alfa E4W is tolerated well in stable adult patients with Fabry disease. Due to the low number of patients in this study, more research is needed to demonstrate the effects of pegunigalsidase alfa given E4W. Further evidence, outside of this clinical trial, should be factored in for physicians to prolong the biweekly ERT intervals to E4W. TAKE-HOME MESSAGE: Treatment with 2 mg/kg pegunigalsidase alfa every 4 weeks could offer a new treatment option for patients with Fabry disease.","Myrl Holida, Aleš Linhart, Antonio Pisani, Nicola Longo, François Eyskens, Ozlem Goker-Alpan, Eric Wallace, Patrick Deegan, Camilla Tøndel, Ulla Feldt-Rasmussen, Derralynn Hughes, Anat Sakov, Rossana Rocco, Einat Brill Almon, Sari Alon, Raul Chertkoff, David G Warnock, Stephen Waldek, William R Wilcox, John A Bernat",2024

Investigation of serum neurofilament light chain as a biomarker in Fabry disease.,"Fabry disease (FD) constitutes a rare, X-linked lysosomal storage disorder affecting multiple organ systems, most notably heart, kidneys, and the central nervous system. Neurofilament light chains (NfL) have emerged as a prime candidate for a body fluid biomarker reflecting neuro-axonal injury. We aimed to evaluate its addition to the diagnostic and monitoring armamentarium in FD. Serum NfL concentrations (sNfL) were measured in 50 people with FD (PwFD) and 30 healthy control subjects (HC) using the Simoa© technology, followed by calculation of Z-scores adjusted for age and body mass index. In addition, clinical disease severity in PwFD was measured using the FOS-MSSI (Fabry outcome study - Mainz severity score index), which comprises clinical and paraclinical parameters. PwFD show elevated sNfL Z-scores compared to HC (PwFD: 1.12 [SD 1.5], HC: 0.01 [SD 1.2], p < 0.001). In PwFD, males showed higher sNfL Z-scores than females (1.75 [SD 1.5] vs. 0.73 [SD 1.4]). Importantly, sNfL Z-scores were increased in PwFD with ischemic white matter lesions of the CNS (1.5, SD 2.2 vs. 0.5, SD 2.9, p = 0.03). In our small cohort, sNfL Z-scores correlated fairly with FOS-MSSI (Kendall's-Tau [τ] = 0.25, p = 0.01), and, interestingly with serum creatinine (τ = 0.28, p = 0.005) and estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR, τ =-0.28, p = 0.005). Based on these exploratory results, sNfL might provide value as a biomarker of neuroaxonal damage in FD, possibly reflecting cerebrovascular injury. Additionally, the correlation of sNfL with renal function warrants further investigation.","Markus Ponleitner, Constantin Gatterer, Gabriel Bsteh, Jakob Rath, Patrick Altmann, Thomas Berger, Senta Graf, Gere Sunder-Plassmann, Paulus Stefan Rommer",2024

"Insights of Fabry disease: Expert consensus approach for screening, diagnosis, and multidisciplinary management in chronic kidney disease.","The prevalence of Fabry disease (FD) among males with chronic kidney disease (CKD) of unknown etiology in Taiwan is 0.6%. Despite this, FD is frequently overlooked in clinical settings. To address this issue, two consensus meetings were conducted in Taiwan-one in August 2022 and another in April 2023. The first meeting established screening criteria based on age, gender, family history, cardiac involvement, and symptoms. The second meeting, with a multidisciplinary team, developed treatment recommendations. The consensus emphasizes the importance of proactive data collection in dialysis units and outpatient follow-ups to enhance FD detection and management. The screening algorithm recommends incorporating FD screening into the diagnostic process for CKD patients, regardless of age. Priority is given to patients with a family history of FD, early stroke history, or classical FD symptoms. Comprehensive screening is also advised for CKD patients without obvious classical symptoms. Screening protocols for males include measuring α-galactosidase A enzyme activity, with reduced activity leading to further tests such as lyso-Gb3 level quantification and genetic analysis. For females, the protocol involves evaluating lyso-Gb3 plasma levels and genetic testing. FD, though often underestimated, is more prevalent than recognized and necessitates a multidisciplinary approach for timely diagnosis. Enhancing awareness and adopting a comprehensive approach are essential for improving patient outcomes.","Cheng-Jui Lin, Feng-Jung Yang, Chih-Jen Wu, Ming-Ju Wu, Mai-Szu Wu",2024
