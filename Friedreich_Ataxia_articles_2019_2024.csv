Lack of Concentration-QTc Relationship and Cardiac Risk With Vatiquinone Therapeutic and Supratherapeutic Doses.,"Vatiquinone, a 15-lipoxygenase inhibitor, is in development for patients with Friedreich ataxia. The study determined the effect of vatiquinone on electrocardiogram parameters. This was a 2-part, single-center, randomized, double-blinded, and placebo-controlled study. Part 1 used an adaptive approach to identify a supratherapeutic dose, while Part 2 evaluated the effect of vatiquinone on Fridericia corrected QT interval (QTcF). A safe and tolerated supratherapeutic dose of 1400 mg was identified. Concentration-QTcF analysis confirmed there was no statistically significant relationship between vatiquinone concentration and QTcF. QTcF effect (ie, ΔΔQTcF) exceeding 10 milliseconds was excluded for concentrations up to approximately 11,500 ng/mL. By-time-point analysis confirmed that least-squares mean ΔΔQTcF was below 10 milliseconds. Largest least-squares mean ΔΔQTcF of 1.5 milliseconds was observed at 2 hours after dosing. Vatiquinone did not have a clinically relevant effect on heart rate nor on cardiac conduction (PR interval and QRS interval). No new safety signals were found, as safety data are consistent with the known safety profile of vatiquinone. These findings altogether demonstrated that there is a minimal cardiac risk for vatiquinone concentrations up to the supratherapeutic dose level.","Lucy Lee, Stephen Flach, Hongqi Xue, Lavanya Arivelu, Lee Golden, Ronald Kong, Borje Darpo",2024
"Differential Effects of Cerebellar Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation with Gait Training on Functional Mobility, Balance, and Ataxia Symptoms.","Cerebellar transcranial direct current stimulation (ctDCS) has emerged as a promising, non-invasive, and safe neuromodulatory intervention capable of reducing ataxia symptoms and restoring cerebellum-motor connectivity. However, previous studies have only applied ctDCS in isolation, without association with specific training. This study aimed to assess the effect of ctDCS combined with gait training on functional mobility, balance, and symptoms and severity of ataxia. A randomized, triple-blind, sham-controlled, bi-center clinical trial was conducted with forty-four adults with cerebellar ataxia. Volunteers were randomized to receive five daily sessions of either real ctDCS (n = 11; 2 mA for 25 min) or sham ctDCS (n = 11) during gait training. Functional mobility, balance, and symptoms and severity of ataxia were assessed using the Time Up and Go test, the MiniBESTest, and the Scale for the Assessment and Rating of Ataxia (SARA), respectively, before and after the interventions. Both groups showed improvement in functional mobility, but there was no significant difference between the ctDCS and sham groups. However, the ctDCS group demonstrated significant improvements in cerebellar ataxia severity as reflected by SARA scores, particularly in tests of stance, sitting, speech disturbance, nose-finger test, and heel-shin slide test. Notably, no improvements were observed in balance. This study indicates that while ctDCS combined with gait training may improve specific symptoms of cerebellar ataxia, it does not significantly enhance overall functional mobility compared to sham treatment.","Rodrigo Brito, João Victor Fabrício, Aurine Araujo, Mariana Sacchi, Adriana Baltar, Fernanda Albuquerque Lima, Ana Cecília Ribeiro, Bárbara Sousa, Camilla Santos, Clarice Tanaka, Kátia Monte-Silva",2024
Skeletal Muscle Involvement in Friedreich Ataxia.,"Friedreich Ataxia (FRDA) is an inherited neuromuscular disorder triggered by a deficit of the mitochondrial protein frataxin. At a cellular level, frataxin deficiency results in insufficient iron-sulfur cluster biosynthesis and impaired mitochondrial function and adenosine triphosphate production. The main clinical manifestation is a progressive balance and coordination disorder which depends on the involvement of peripheral and central sensory pathways as well as of the cerebellum. Besides the neurological involvement, FRDA affects also the striated muscles. The most prominent manifestation is a hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, which also represents the major determinant of premature mortality. Moreover, FRDA displays skeletal muscle involvement, which contributes to the weakness and marked fatigue evident throughout the course of the disease. Herein, we review skeletal muscle findings in FRDA generated by functional imaging, histology, as well as multiomics techniques in both disease models and in patients. Altogether, these findings corroborate a disease phenotype in skeletal muscle and support the notion of progressive mitochondrial damage as a driver of disease progression in FRDA. Furthermore, we highlight the relevance of skeletal muscle investigations in the development of biomarkers for early-phase trials and future therapeutic strategies in FRDA.","Elisabetta Indelicato, Julia Wanschitz, Wolfgang Löscher, Sylvia Boesch",2024
"Deciphering the ferroptosis pathways in dorsal root ganglia of Friedreich ataxia models. The role of LKB1/AMPK, KEAP1, and GSK3β in the impairment of the NRF2 response.","Friedreich ataxia (FA) is a rare neurodegenerative disease caused by decreased levels of the mitochondrial protein frataxin. Frataxin has been related in iron homeostasis, energy metabolism, and oxidative stress. Ferroptosis has recently been shown to be involved in FA cellular degeneration; however, its role in dorsal root ganglion (DRG) sensory neurons, the cells that are affected the most and the earliest, is mostly unknown. In this study, we used primary cultures of frataxin-deficient DRG neurons as well as DRG from the FXN<sup>I151F</sup> mouse model to study ferroptosis and its regulatory pathways. A lack of frataxin induced upregulation of transferrin receptor 1 and decreased ferritin and mitochondrial iron accumulation, a source of oxidative stress. However, there was impaired activation of NRF2, a key transcription factor involved in the antioxidant response pathway. Decreased total and nuclear NRF2 explains the downregulation of both SLC7A11 (a member of the system Xc, which transports cystine required for glutathione synthesis) and glutathione peroxidase 4, responsible for increased lipid peroxidation, the main markers of ferroptosis. Such dysregulation could be due to the increase in KEAP1 and the activation of GSK3β, which promote cytosolic localization and degradation of NRF2. Moreover, there was a deficiency in the LKB1/AMPK pathway, which would also impair NRF2 activity. AMPK acts as a positive regulator of NRF2 and it is activated by the upstream kinase LKB1. The levels of LKB1 were reduced when frataxin decreased, in agreement with reduced pAMPK (Thr172), the active form of AMPK. SIRT1, a known activator of LKB1, was also reduced when frataxin decreased. MT-6378, an AMPK activator, restored NRF2 levels, increased GPX4 levels and reduced lipid peroxidation. In conclusion, this study demonstrated that frataxin deficiency in DRG neurons disrupts iron homeostasis and the intricate regulation of molecular pathways affecting NRF2 activation and the cellular response to oxidative stress, leading to ferroptosis.","Arabela Sanz-Alcázar, Marta Portillo-Carrasquer, Fabien Delaspre, Maria Pazos-Gil, Jordi Tamarit, Joaquim Ros, Elisa Cabiscol",2024

Understanding the mechanisms of food effect on omaveloxolone pharmacokinetics through physiologically based biopharmaceutics modeling.,"Omaveloxolone is a nuclear factor (erythroid-derived 2)-like 2 activator approved in the United States and the European Union for the treatment of patients with Friedreich ataxia aged ≥16 years, with a recommended dosage of 150 mg orally once daily on an empty stomach. The effect of the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) high-fat breakfast on the pharmacokinetic profile of omaveloxolone observed in study 408-C-1703 (NCT03664453) deviated from the usual linear correlation between fed/fasted maximum plasma concentration (C<sub>max</sub>) and area under the concentration-time curve (AUC) ratios reported for various oral drugs across 323 food effect studies. Here, physiologically based biopharmaceutics modeling (PBBM) was implemented to predict and explain the effect of the FDA high-fat breakfast on a 150-mg dose of omaveloxolone. The model was developed and validated based on dissolution and pharmacokinetic data available across dose-ranging, food effect, and drug-drug interaction clinical studies. PBBM predictions support clinical observations of the unique effect of a high-fat meal on omaveloxolone pharmacokinetic profile, in which the C<sub>max</sub> increased by 350% with only a 15% increase in the AUC. Key parameters influencing omaveloxolone pharmacokinetics in the fasted state based on a parameter sensitivity analysis included bile salt solubilization, CYP3A4 activity, drug substance particle size distribution, and permeability. Mechanistically, in vivo omaveloxolone absorption was solubility and dissolution rate limited. However, in the fed state, higher bile salt solubilization led to more rapid dissolution with predominant absorption in the upper gastrointestinal tract, resulting in increased susceptibility to first-pass gut extraction; this accounts for the lack of correlation between C<sub>max</sub> and AUC for omaveloxolone.","Xavier J H Pepin, Scott M Hynes, Hamim Zahir, Deborah Walker, Lois Q Semmens, Sandra Suarez-Sharp",2024
Nerve ultrasound in CANVAS-spectrum disease: Reduced nerve size distinguishes genetically confirmed CANVAS from other axonal polyneuropathies.,"Ultrasound nerve cross-sectional area (CSA) of patients affected with axonal neuropathy usually shows normal value. Cerebellar ataxia, neuropathy and vestibular areflexia syndrome (CANVAS) seems to represent an exception, showing smaller CSA, but previous reports did not test for biallelic RFC1 gene repeat expansions.","Alessandro Salvalaggio, Mario Cacciavillani, Benedetta Tierro, Daniele Coraci, Riccardo Currò, Moreno Ferrarini, Elena Pegoraro, Luca Bello, Gian Maria Fabrizi, Alessandro Filla, Luca Padua, Fiore Manganelli, Andrea Cortese, Chiara Briani",2024
A Pilot Phase 2 Randomized Trial to Evaluate the Safety and Potential Efficacy of Etravirine in Friedreich Ataxia Patients.,"A drug repositioning effort supported the possible use of the anti-HIV drug etravirine as a disease-modifying drug for Friedreich ataxia (FRDA). Etravirine increases frataxin protein and corrects the biochemical defects in cells derived from FRDA patients. Because of these findings, and since etravirine displays a favorable safety profile, we conducted a pilot open-label phase 2 clinical trial assessing the safety and potential efficacy of etravirine in FRDA patients.","Gabriella Paparella, Cristina Stragà, Nicola Pesenti, Valentina Dal Molin, Gian Antonio Martorel, Vasco Merotto, Cristina Genova, Arianna Piazza, Giuseppe Piccoli, Elena Panzeri, Alessandra Rufini, Roberto Testi, Andrea Martinuzzi",2024
Interplay of FXN expression and lipolysis in white adipocytes plays a critical role in insulin sensitivity in Friedreich's ataxia mouse model.,"Frataxin (FXN) is required for iron-sulfur cluster biogenesis, and its loss causes the early-onset neurodegenerative disease Friedreich ataxia (FRDA). Loss of FXN is a susceptibility factor in the development of diabetes, a common metabolic complication after myocardial hypertrophy in patients with FRDA. The underlying mechanism of FXN deficient-induced hyperglycemia in FRDA is, however, poorly understood. In this study, we confirmed that the FXN deficiency mouse model YG8R develops insulin resistance in elder individuals by disturbing lipid metabolic homeostasis in adipose tissues. Evaluation of lipolysis, lipogenesis, and fatty acid β-oxidation showed that lipolysis is most severely affected in white adipose tissues. Consistently, FXN deficiency significantly decreased expression of lipolytic genes encoding adipose triglyceride lipase (Atgl) and hormone-sensitive lipase (Hsl) resulting in adipocyte enlargement and inflammation. Lipolysis induction by fasting or cold exposure remarkably upregulated FXN expression, though FXN deficiency lessened the competency of lipolysis compared with the control or wild type mice. Moreover, we found that the impairment of lipolysis was present at a young age, a few months earlier than hyperglycemia and insulin resistance. Forskolin, an activator of lipolysis, or pioglitazone, an agonist of PPARγ, improved insulin sensitivity in FXN-deficient adipocytes or mice. We uncovered the interplay between FXN expression and lipolysis and found that impairment of lipolysis, particularly the white adipocytes, is an early event, likely, as a primary cause for insulin resistance in FRDA patients at later age.","Lin Wu, Fei Huang, Lu Yang, Liu Yang, Zichen Sun, Jinghua Zhang, Siyu Xia, Hongting Zhao, Yibing Ding, Dezhi Bian, Kuanyu Li",2024
Emerging therapies in hereditary ataxias.,"Recent investigations have defined the pathophysiological basis of many hereditary ataxias (HAs), including loss-of-function as well as gain-of-function mechanisms at either the RNA or protein level. Preclinical studies have assessed gene editing, gene and protein replacement, gene enhancement, and gene knockdown strategies. Methodologies include viral vector delivery of genes, oligonucleotide therapies, cell-penetrating peptides, synthetic transcription factors, and technologies to deliver therapies to defined targets. In this review, we focus on Friedreich ataxia (FRDA) and the polyglutamine ataxias in which translational research is active. However, much remains to be done to identify safe and effective molecules, create ideal delivery methods, and perform innovative clinical trials to prove the safety and efficacy of treatments for these rare but devastating diseases.","Mallory L S Eisel, Matthew Burns, Tetsuo Ashizawa, Barry Byrne, Manuela Corti, Sub H Subramony",2024
A multiple animal and cellular models approach to study frataxin deficiency in Friedreich Ataxia.,"Friedreich's ataxia (FA) is one of the most frequent inherited recessive ataxias characterized by a progressive sensory and spinocerebellar ataxia. The main causative mutation is a GAA repeat expansion in the first intron of the frataxin (FXN) gene which leads to a transcriptional silencing of the gene resulting in a deficit in FXN protein. The nature of the mutation (an unstable GAA expansion), as well as the multi-systemic nature of the disease (with neural and non-neural sites affected) make the generation of models for Friedreich's ataxia quite challenging. Over the years, several cellular and animal models for FA have been developed. These models are all complementary and possess their own strengths to investigate different aspects of the disease, such as the epigenetics of the locus or the pathophysiology of the disease, as well as being used to developed novel therapeutic approaches. This review will explore the recent advancements in the different mammalian models developed for FA.","Valentine Mosbach, Hélène Puccio",2024
New and Emerging Drug and Gene Therapies for Friedreich Ataxia.,"The life shortening nature of Friedreich Ataxia (FRDA) demands the search for therapies that can delay, stop or reverse its relentless trajectory. This review provides a contemporary position of drug and gene therapies for FRDA currently in phase 1 clinical trials and beyond. Despite significant scientific advances in the specificity of both compounds and targets developed and investigated, challenges remain for the advancement of treatments in a limited recruitment population. Currently therapies focus on reducing oxidative stress and improving mitochondrial function, modulating frataxin controlled metabolic pathways and gene replacement and editing. Approval of omaveloxolone, the first treatment for individuals with FRDA aged 16 years and over, has created much excitement for both those living with FRDA and those that care for them. The process of approval of omaveloxolone by the US Food and Drug Administration highlighted the importance of sensitive outcome measures and the significant role of data from natural history studies.","Varlli Scott, Martin B Delatycki, Geneieve Tai, Louise A Corben",2024
Glial cell activation precedes neurodegeneration in the cerebellar cortex of the YG8-800 murine model of Friedreich ataxia.,"Friedreich ataxia is a hereditary neurodegenerative disorder resulting from reduced levels of the protein frataxin due to an expanded GAA repeat in the FXN gene. This deficiency causes progressive degeneration of specific neuronal populations in the cerebellum and the consequent loss of movement coordination and equilibrium, which are some of the main symptoms observed in affected individuals. Like in other neurodegenerative diseases, previous studies suggest that glial cells could be involved in the neurodegenerative process and disease progression in patients with Friedreich ataxia. In this work, we followed and characterized the progression of changes in the cerebellar cortex in the latest version of Friedreich ataxia humanized mouse model, YG8-800 (Fxn<sup>null</sup>:YG8s(GAA)<sub>>800</sub>), which carries a human FXN transgene containing >800 GAA repeats. Comparative analyses of behavioral, histopathological, and biochemical parameters were conducted between the control strain Y47R and YG8-800 mice at different time points. Our findings revealed that YG8-800 mice exhibit an ataxic phenotype characterized by poor motor coordination, decreased body weight, cerebellar atrophy, neuronal loss, and changes in synaptic proteins. Additionally, early activation of glial cells, predominantly astrocytes and microglia, was observed preceding neuronal degeneration, as was increased expression of key proinflammatory cytokines and downregulation of neurotrophic factors. Together, our results show that the YG8-800 mouse model exhibits a stronger phenotype than previous experimental murine models, reliably recapitulating some of the features observed in humans. Accordingly, this humanized model could represent a valuable tool for studying Friedreich ataxia molecular disease mechanisms and for preclinical evaluation of possible therapies.","Andrés Vicente-Acosta, Saúl Herranz-Martín, Maria Ruth Pazos, Jorge Galán-Cruz, Mario Amores, Frida Loria, Javier Díaz-Nido",2024
Oculomotor and Vestibular Deficits in Friedreich Ataxia - Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis of Quantitative Measurements.,"Disease-specific oculomotor assessments play a crucial role in the early diagnosis of hereditary cerebellar ataxias. Whereas several studies have reported on quantitative oculomotor and vestibular measurements in Friedreich's Ataxia (FRDA), the value of specific oculomotor paradigms remains unclear. We aimed to address this knowledge gap through a systematic literature review and providing disease-specific recommendations for a tailored set of eye-movement recordings in FRDA. MEDLINE and Embase were searched for studies reporting on quantitative oculomotor and/or vestibular measurements in FRDA-patients. Data on oculomotor and vestibular parameters were extracted and correlations with a range of clinical parameters were sought. Included studies (n = 17) reported on 185 patients. Abnormalities observed included the presence of saccadic intrusions (143/161) such as square-wave jerks (SWJ, 90/109) and ocular flutter (21/43), impaired eccentric gaze-holding (40/104), abnormal pursuit (81/93) and angular vestibulo-ocular reflex (aVOR) deficits (39/48). For visually-guided saccades (VGS), we frequently observed increases in saccade latency (27/38) and dysmetric saccades (71/93), whereas saccade velocity was more often preserved (37/43). Augmented anti-saccade (AS) latency, downbeat nystagmus and frequent macro-SWJ correlated with disease duration. Increased AS-latency and VGS-latency, frequent macro-SWJ, reduced aVOR-gain and augmented aVOR peak-latency correlated with disease severity. A broad range of oculomotor and vestibular deficits are documented in the literature. Impairments in pursuit, saccades and aVOR-responses are most commonly reported, and as such, should be prioritized as disease markers. Quantitative oculomotor testing in FRDA may facilitate early diagnosis and prove valuable in monitoring disease progression and treatment response.","E Sohns, D J Szmulewicz, A A Tarnutzer",2024

Gradient of microstructural damage along the dentato-thalamo-cortical tract in Friedreich ataxia.,"The dentato-thalamo-cortical tract (DTT) is the main cerebellar efferent pathway. Degeneration of the DTT is a core feature of Friedreich ataxia (FRDA). However, it remains unclear whether DTT disruption is spatially specific, with some segments being more impacted than others. This study aimed to investigate microstructural integrity along the DTT in FRDA using a profilometry diffusion MRI (dMRI) approach.","Sirio Cocozza, Sara Bosticardo, Matteo Battocchio, Louise Corben, Martin Delatycki, Gary Egan, Nellie Georgiou-Karistianis, Serena Monti, Giuseppe Palma, Chiara Pane, Francesco Saccà, Simona Schiavi, Louisa Selvadurai, Mario Tranfa, Alessandro Daducci, Arturo Brunetti, Ian H Harding",2024

"Relative Bioavailability of Omaveloxolone When Capsules Are Sprinkled Over and Mixed in Applesauce Compared With Administration as Intact Omaveloxolone Capsules: A Phase 1, Randomized, Open-Label, Single-Dose, Crossover Study in Healthy Adults.","Omaveloxolone (SKYCLARYS<sup>®</sup>) is approved for the treatment of Friedreich ataxia (FA) in patients aged ≥16 years in the United States and European Union (EU). The recommended dosage is 150 mg administered orally once daily as three 50-mg capsules. However, some patients with FA may have oropharyngeal dysphagia or difficulty swallowing whole capsules; therefore, alternate method(s) of administration are needed. A Phase 1 clinical study in 32 healthy volunteers evaluated the relative bioavailability, safety, and tolerability of a single dose of omaveloxolone when capsule contents were sprinkled on and mixed in applesauce compared to when taken as intact capsules. Palatability when sprinkled on and mixed in applesauce was assessed with a questionnaire. After a single 150-mg dose, the peak and overall exposures of omaveloxolone were similar irrespective of administration method, with the 90% CIs of the geometric least squares mean ratio (%) for maximum plasma concentration (C<sub>max</sub>), AUC<sub>0-t</sub>, and AUC<sub>0-∞</sub> within the 80% to 125% reference intervals. Omaveloxolone was absorbed more slowly as intact capsules (median t<sub>max</sub>, 10 h) compared with sprinkled capsule contents over applesauce (median t<sub>max</sub>, 6 h). With chronic daily administration of omaveloxolone to treat FA, the 4-h difference in t<sub>max</sub> is not considered clinically relevant. Sprinkled omaveloxolone capsule contents on applesauce were well tolerated, with acceptable palatability and no serious adverse events. Given the similar systemic exposure when capsules were swallowed whole, sprinkling omaveloxolone capsule contents on and mixing in applesauce is a feasible alternative method of administering omaveloxolone and has been included in both the United States and EU prescribing information.","Scott M Hynes, Angie Goldsberry, Patrick D Henneghan, Masako Murai, Aparna Shinde, Jason A Wells, Lucy Wu, Tony Wu, Hamim Zahir, Seemi Khan",2024

An RNA-seq study in Friedreich ataxia patients identified hsa-miR-148a-3p as a putative prognostic biomarker of the disease.,"Friedreich ataxia (FRDA) is a life-threatening hereditary ataxia; its incidence is 1:50,000 individuals in the Caucasian population. A unique therapeutic drug for FRDA, the antioxidant Omaveloxolone, has been recently approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA). FRDA is a multi-systemic neurodegenerative disease; in addition to a progressive neurodegeneration, FRDA is characterized by hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, diabetes mellitus and musculoskeletal deformities. Cardiomyopathy is the predominant cause of premature death. The onset of FRDA typically occurs between the ages of 5 and 15. Given the complexity and heterogeneity of clinical features and the variability of their onset, the identification of biomarkers capable of assessing disease progression and monitoring the efficacy of treatments is essential to facilitate decision making in clinical practice. We conducted an RNA-seq analysis in peripheral blood mononuclear cells from FRDA patients and healthy donors, identifying a signature of small non-coding RNAs (sncRNAs) capable of distinguishing healthy individuals from the majority of FRDA patients. Among the differentially expressed sncRNAs, microRNAs are a class of small non-coding endogenous RNAs that regulate posttranscriptional silencing of target genes. In FRDA plasma samples, hsa-miR-148a-3p resulted significantly upregulated. The analysis of the Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve, combining the circulating expression levels of hsa-miR-148a-3p and hsa-miR-223-3p (previously identified by our group), revealed an Area Under the Curve (AUC) of 0.86 (95%, Confidence Interval 0.77-0.95; p-value < 0.0001). An in silico prediction analysis indicated that the IL6ST gene, an interesting marker of neuroinflammation in FRDA, is a common target gene of both miRNAs. Our findings support the evaluation of combined expression levels of different circulating miRNAs as potent epi-biomarkers in FRDA. Moreover, we found hsa-miR-148a-3p significantly over-expressed in Intermediate and Late-Onset Friedreich Ataxia patients' group (IOG and LOG, respectively) compared to healthy individuals, indicating it as a putative prognostic biomarker in this pathology.","Chiara Vancheri, Andrea Quatrana, Elena Morini, Caterina Mariotti, Alessia Mongelli, Mario Fichera, Alessandra Rufini, Ivano Condò, Roberto Testi, Giuseppe Novelli, Florence Malisan, Francesca Amati",2024
An Update on the Adult-Onset Hereditary Cerebellar Ataxias: Novel Genetic Causes and New Diagnostic Approaches.,"The hereditary cerebellar ataxias (HCAs) are rare, progressive neurologic disorders caused by variants in many different genes. Inheritance may follow autosomal dominant, autosomal recessive, X-linked or mitochondrial patterns. The list of genes associated with adult-onset cerebellar ataxia is continuously growing, with several new genes discovered in the last few years. This includes short-tandem repeat (STR) expansions in RFC1, causing cerebellar ataxia, neuropathy, vestibular areflexia syndrome (CANVAS), FGF14-GAA causing spinocerebellar ataxia type 27B (SCA27B), and THAP11. In addition, the genetic basis for SCA4, has recently been identified as a STR expansion in ZFHX3. Given the large and growing number of genes, and different gene variant types, the approach to diagnostic testing for adult-onset HCA can be complex. Testing methods include targeted evaluation of STR expansions (e.g. SCAs, Friedreich ataxia, fragile X-associated tremor/ataxia syndrome, dentatorubral-pallidoluysian atrophy), next generation sequencing for conventional variants, which may include targeted gene panels, whole exome, or whole genome sequencing, followed by various potential additional tests. This review proposes a diagnostic approach for clinical testing, highlights the challenges with current testing technologies, and discusses future advances which may overcome these limitations. Implementing long-read sequencing has the potential to transform the diagnostic approach in HCA, with the overall aim to improve the diagnostic yield.","Laura Ivete Rudaks, Dennis Yeow, Karl Ng, Ira W Deveson, Marina L Kennerson, Kishore Raj Kumar",2024
Characterization of clinical serum cardiac biomarker levels in individuals with Friedreich ataxia.,"Friedreich ataxia is a progressive autosomal recessive neurodegenerative disorder characterized by ataxia, dyscoordination, and cardiomyopathy. A subset of patients with Friedreich ataxia have elevated levels of serum cardiac troponin I, but associations with disease outcomes and features of cardiomyopathy remain unclear. In this study, we characterized clinically obtained serum cardiac biomarker levels including troponin I, troponin T, and B-type natriuretic peptide in subjects with Friedreich ataxia and evaluated their association with markers of disease. While unprovoked troponin I levels were elevated in 36% of the cohort, cTnI levels associated with a cardiac event (provoked) were higher than unprovoked levels. In multivariate linear regression models, younger age predicted increased troponin I values, and in logistic regression models younger age, female sex, and marginally longer GAA repeat length predicted abnormal troponin I levels. In subjects with multiple assessments, mean unprovoked troponin I levels decreased slightly over time. The presence of abnormal troponin I values and their levels were predicted by echocardiographic measures of hypertrophy. In addition, troponin I levels predicted long-term markers of clinical cardiac dysfunction over time to a modest degree. Consequently, troponin I values provide a marker of hypertrophy but only a minimally predictive biomarker for later cardiac manifestations of disease such as systolic dysfunction or arrhythmia.","David R Lynch, Sonal Sharma, Patrick Hearle, Nathaniel Greeley, Katherine Gunther, Medina Keita, Cassandra Strawser, Lauren Hauser, Courtney Park, Kimberly Schadt, Kimberly Y Lin",2024

Glial overexpression of Tspo extends lifespan and protects against frataxin deficiency in Drosophila.,"The translocator protein TSPO is an evolutionary conserved mitochondrial protein overexpressed in various contexts of neurodegeneration. Friedreich Ataxia (FA) is a neurodegenerative disease due to GAA expansions in the FXN gene leading to decreased expression of frataxin, a mitochondrial protein involved in the biosynthesis of iron-sulfur clusters. We previously reported that Tspo was overexpressed in a Drosophila model of this disease generated by CRISPR/Cas9 insertion of approximately 200 GAA in the intron of fh, the fly frataxin gene. Here, we describe a new Drosophila model of FA with 42 GAA repeats, called fh-GAAs. The smaller expansion size allowed to obtain adults exhibiting hallmarks of the FA disease, including short lifespan, locomotory defects and hypersensitivity to oxidative stress. The reduced lifespan was fully rescued by ubiquitous expression of human FXN, confirming that both frataxins share conserved functions. We observed that Tspo was overexpressed in heads and decreased in intestines of these fh-GAAs flies. Then, we further overexpressed Tspo specifically in glial cells and observed improved survival. Finally, we investigated the effects of Tspo overexpression in healthy flies. Increased longevity was conferred by glial-specific overexpression, with opposite effects in neurons. Overall, this study highlights protective effects of glial TSPO in Drosophila both in a neurodegenerative and a healthy context.","Estelle Jullian, Maria Russi, Ema Turki, Margaux Bouvelot, Laura Tixier, Sandrine Middendorp, Elodie Martin, Véronique Monnier",2024
"Development and Validation of SCACOMS, a Composite Scale for Assessing Disease Progression and Treatment Effects in Spinocerebellar Ataxia.","Spinocerebellar ataxias (SCA) are rare inherited neurodegenerative disorders characterized by a progressive impairment of gait, balance, limb coordination, and speech. There is currently no composite scale that includes multiple aspects of the SCA experience to assess disease progression and treatment effects. Applying the method of partial least squares (PLS) regression, we developed the Spinocerebellar Ataxia Composite Scale (SCACOMS) from two SCA natural history datasets (NCT01060371, NCT02440763). PLS regression selected items based on their ability to detect clinical decline, with optimized weights based on the item's degree of progression. Following model validation, SCACOMS was leveraged to examine disease progression and treatment effects in a 48-week SCA clinical trial cohort (NCT03701399). Items from the Clinical Global Impression-Global Improvement Scale (CGI-I), the Friedreich Ataxia Rating Scale (FARS) - functional stage, and the Modified Functional Scale for the Assessment and Rating of Ataxia (f-SARA) were objectively selected with weightings based on their sensitivity to clinical decline. The resulting SCACOMS exhibited improved sensitivity to disease progression and greater treatment effects (compared to the original scales from which they were derived) in a 48-week clinical trial of a novel therapeutic agent. The trial analyses also provided a SCACOMS-derived estimate of the temporal delay in SCA disease progression. SCACOMS is a useful composite measure, effectively capturing disease progression and highlighting treatment effects in patients with SCA. SCACOMS will be a powerful tool in future studies given its sensitivity to clinical decline and ability to detect a meaningful clinical impact of disease-modifying treatments.","Gilbert L'Italien, Evan Popoff, Basia Rogula, Lauren Powell, Michele Potashman, Sam Dickson, Patrick O'Keefe, Melissa Beiner, Vlad Coric, Susan Perlman, Jeremy D Schmahmann, Suzanne Hendrix",2024
Calcitriol Treatment Is Safe and Increases Frataxin Levels in Friedreich Ataxia Patients.,"Calcitriol, the active form of vitamin D (also known as 1,25-dihydroxycholecalciferol), improves the phenotype and increases frataxin levels in cell models of Friedreich ataxia (FRDA).","Berta Alemany-Perna, Jordi Tamarit, Elisa Cabiscol, Fabien Delaspre, Albert Miguela, Joana Maria Huertas-Pons, Ana Quiroga-Varela, Miguel Merchan Ruiz, Daniel López Domínguez, Lluís Ramió I Torrentà, David Genís, Joaquim Ros",2024
"Perioperative management and outcomes for posterior spinal fusion in patients with Friedreich ataxia: A single-center, retrospective study.","Friedreich ataxia is a rare genetic disorder associated with progressive mitochondrial dysfunction leading to widespread sequelae including ataxia, muscle weakness, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, diabetes mellitus, and neuromuscular scoliosis. Children with Friedreich ataxia are at high risk for periprocedural complications during posterior spinal fusion due to their comorbidities.","Elizabeth M O'Brien, Natalie Neiswinter, Kimberly Y Lin, David Lynch, Keith Baldwin, Victoria Profeta, John M Flynn, Wallis T Muhly",2024
Localized Changes in Dentate Nucleus Shape and Magnetic Susceptibility in Friedreich Ataxia.,"The dentate nuclei of the cerebellum are key sites of neuropathology in Friedreich ataxia (FRDA). Reduced dentate nucleus volume and increased mean magnetic susceptibility, a proxy of iron concentration, have been reported by magnetic resonance imaging studies in people with FRDA. Here, we investigate whether these changes are regionally heterogeneous.","Ian H Harding, Muhammad Ikhsan Nur Karim, Louisa P Selvadurai, Louise A Corben, Martin B Delatycki, Serena Monti, Francesco Saccà, Nellie Georgiou-Karistianis, Sirio Cocozza, Gary F Egan",2024
