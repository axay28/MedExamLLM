Oncological Aspects of Lysosomal Storage Diseases.,"Lysosomal storage diseases (LSDs) are caused by the deficient activity of a lysosomal hydrolase or the lack of a functional membrane protein, transporter, activator, or other protein. Lysosomal enzymes break down macromolecular compounds, which contribute to metabolic homeostasis. Stored, undegraded materials have multiple effects on cells that lead to the activation of autophagy and apoptosis, including the toxic effects of lyso-lipids, the disruption of intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> ion homeostasis, the secondary storage of macromolecular compounds, the activation of signal transduction, apoptosis, inflammatory processes, deficiencies of intermediate compounds, and many other pathways. Clinical observations have shown that carriers of potentially pathogenic variants in LSD-associated genes and patients affected with some LSDs are at a higher risk of cancer, although the results of studies on the frequency of oncological diseases in LSD patients are controversial. Cancer is found in individuals affected with Gaucher disease, Fabry disease, Niemann-Pick type A and B diseases, alfa-mannosidosis, and sialidosis. Increased cancer prevalence has also been reported in carriers of a potentially pathogenic variant of an LSD gene, namely <i>CLN3</i>, <i>SGSH</i>, <i>GUSB</i>, <i>NEU1</i>, and, to a lesser extent, in other genes. In this review, LSDs in which oncological events can be observed are described.",Agnieszka Ługowska,2024
Functional Analysis of Human <i>GBA1</i> Missense Mutations in <i>Drosophila</i>: Insights into Gaucher Disease Pathogenesis and Phenotypic Consequences.,"The human <i>GBA1</i> gene encodes lysosomal acid β-glucocerebrosidase, whose activity is deficient in Gaucher disease (GD). In <i>Drosophila</i>, there are two <i>GBA1</i> orthologs, <i>Gba1a</i> and <i>Gba1b</i>, and <i>Gba1b</i> is the bona fide GCase encoding gene. Several fly lines with different deletions in the <i>Gba1b</i> were studied in the past. However, since most GD-associated <i>GBA1</i> mutations are point mutations, we created missense mutations homologous to the two most common GD mutations: the mild N370S mutation (D415S in <i>Drosophila</i>) and the severe L444P mutation (L494P in <i>Drosophila</i>), using the CRISPR-Cas9 technology. Flies homozygous for the D415S mutation (dubbed D370S hereafter) presented low GCase activity and substrate accumulation, which led to lysosomal defects, activation of the Unfolded Protein Response (UPR), inflammation/neuroinflammation, and neurodegeneration along with earlier death compared to control flies. Surprisingly, the L494P (called L444P hereafter) flies presented higher GCase activity with fewer lysosomal defects and milder disease in comparison to that presented by the D370S homozygous flies. Treatment with ambroxol had a limited effect on all homozygous fly lines tested. Overall, our results underscore the differences between the fly and human GCase enzymes, as evidenced by the distinct phenotypic outcomes of mutations in flies compared to those observed in human GD patients.","Aparna Kuppuramalingam, Or Cabasso, Mia Horowitz",2024

6-O-Alkyl 4-methylumbelliferyl-β-D-glucosides as selective substrates for GBA1 in the discovery of glycosylated sterols.,"Gaucher disease (GD) is a lysosomal storage disorder (LSD) resulting from inherited glucocerebrosidase (GBA1) deficiency. GD diagnosis relies on GBA1 activity assays, typically employing 4-methylumbelliferyl-β-D-glucopyranoside (4MU-β-Glc) as fluorogenic substrate. However, these assays suffer from background 4MU release by the non-lysosomal GBA2 and cytosolic GBA3 enzymes. Here we developed GBA1-selective fluorogenic substrates by synthesizing a series of 6-O-acyl-4MU-β-Glc substrates with diverse fatty acid tails. Because of chemical and enzymatic instability of the ester bonds, analogues of 6-O-palmitoyl-4MU-β-Glc (3) with different chemical linkages were synthesized. 6-O-alkyl-4MU-β-Glc 9, featuring an ether linkage, emerged as the most optimal GBA1 substrate, exhibiting both a low K<sub>m</sub> and compared to substrate 3 a high V<sub>max</sub>. Importantly, substrate 9 is not hydrolyzed by GBA2 and GBA3, and therefore acts as superior substrate for GD diagnosis. Plants contain glycosyl phytosterols (campesterol, β-sitosterol and sigmasterol) that may also be acylated at C-6. LC-MS/MS analysis revealed that 6-O-acylated and regular glycosylcholesterol (HexChol) tend to be increased in GD patient spleens. Moreover, significant increases in 6-O-acyl-glycosyl-phytosterols were detected in GD spleens. Our findings suggest uptake of (6-O-acyl)-glycosyl-phytosterols from plant food and subsequent lysosomal processing by GBA1, and comprise the first example of accumulation of an exogenous class of glycolipids in GD. Excessive exposure of rodents to glycosylated phytosterols has been reported to induce manifestations of Parkinson's disease (PD). Further investigation is warranted to determine whether (6-O-acyl)-glycosyl-phytosterols could contribute to the enigmatic link between inherited defects in GBA1 and the risk for PD.","Stef Bannink, Kateryna O Bila, Joosje van Weperen, Nina A M Ligthart, Maria J Ferraz, Rolf G Boot, Daan van der Vliet, Daphne E C Boer, Herman S Overkleeft, Marta Artola, Johannes M F G Aerts",2024

High-throughput screening for small-molecule stabilizers of misfolded glucocerebrosidase in Gaucher disease and Parkinson's disease.,"Glucocerebrosidase (GCase) is implicated in both a rare, monogenic disorder (Gaucher disease, GD) and a common, multifactorial condition (Parkinson's disease, PD); hence, it is an urgent therapeutic target. To identify correctors of severe protein misfolding and trafficking obstruction manifested by the pathogenic L444P-variant of GCase, we developed a suite of quantitative, high-throughput, cell-based assays. First, we labeled GCase with a small proluminescent HiBiT peptide reporter tag, enabling quantitation of protein stabilization in cells while faithfully maintaining target biology. TALEN-based gene editing allowed for stable integration of a single HiBiT-<i>GBA1</i> transgene into an intragenic safe-harbor locus in <i>GBA1</i>-knockout H4 (neuroglioma) cells. This GD cell model was amenable to lead discovery via titration-based quantitative high-throughput screening and lead optimization via structure-activity relationships. A primary screen of 10,779 compounds from the NCATS bioactive collections identified 140 stabilizers of HiBiT-GCase-L444P, including both pharmacological chaperones (ambroxol and noninhibitory chaperone NCGC326) and proteostasis regulators (panobinostat, trans-ISRIB, and pladienolide B). Two complementary high-content imaging-based assays were deployed to triage hits: The fluorescence-quenched substrate LysoFix-GBA captured functional lysosomal GCase activity, while an immunofluorescence assay featuring antibody hGCase-1/23 directly visualized GCase lysosomal translocation. NCGC326 was active in both secondary assays and completely reversed pathological glucosylsphingosine accumulation. Finally, we tested the concept of combination therapy by demonstrating synergistic actions of NCGC326 with proteostasis regulators in enhancing GCase-L444P levels. Looking forward, these physiologically relevant assays can facilitate the identification, pharmacological validation, and medicinal chemistry optimization of small molecules targeting GCase, ultimately leading to a viable therapeutic for GD and PD.","Darian Williams, Logan M Glasstetter, Tiffany T Jong, Tiffany Chen, Abhijeet Kapoor, Sha Zhu, Yanping Zhu, Raul Calvo, Alexandra Gehrlein, Kimberly Wong, Andrew N Hogan, David J Vocadlo, Ravi Jagasia, Juan J Marugan, Ellen Sidransky, Mark J Henderson, Yu Chen",2024
[Lysosomal storage disorders - Fabry disease and Gaucher disease].,"Lysosomal storage disorders (LSD) are a heterogenous group of inborn errors of metabolism due to lysosomal malfunction. LSDs affect 1 in 5000 live births, albeit every LSD itself has a low incidence. The most common LSDs are Fabry disease and Gaucher disease. The underlying cause mainly is an enzyme deficiency but may also be due to defects in transport or activation proteins, which result in progressive intra- and extra-lysosomal accumulation of undegraded storage material. The lysosomes play a key role in degradation and cellular recycling of macromolecules. Besides disturbance of cellular function, substrate accumulation may result in secondary toxic and/or inflammatory processes. For treatment of Fabry and Gaucher disease, several therapeutic approaches are approved including enzyme replacement therapy, chaperon therapy for Fabry disease and substrate reduction therapy for Gaucher disease.","Lucia Segura Schmitz, Julia B Hennermann, André Lollert",2024
"A Case Report on Invasive Mucormycosis Involving the Maxillary Region, Brain, and Chest.","The maxilla is a facial bone with a dense blood supply. Although rare, infections, trauma, and certain metabolic disorders can lead to necrosis of the maxillary bone. The maxilla, a vital bone forming the roof of the oral cavity, is particularly susceptible to mucormycosis, a prevalent fungal infection, especially in individuals with diabetes and compromised immune systems. Here, we discuss mucormycosis-associated maxillary necrosis in a patient with uncontrolled diabetes. Early identification and treatment of this lethal fungal infection can significantly reduce its mortality and morbidity rates. Due to the maxilla's high vascularity, necrosis is uncommon. However, various infections, including bacterial, viral, and fungal, can lead to maxillary necrosis. Other potential causes include trauma, radiation, prolonged corticosteroid use, and lipid metabolism disorders (like Gaucher disease). Early diagnosis and timely treatment are crucial to significantly reducing the mortality and morbidity associated with this life-threatening fungal infection.","Riya Yadav, Pratapsingh Parihar, Suyash Yadav, Shweta Yadav",2024

Enzyme replacement therapy improves erythropoiesis and iron dysregulation in Gaucher disease.,"Anemia and hyperferritinemia are frequent findings at diagnosis of Gaucher disease (GD). Macrophage-independent dyserythropoiesis and abnormal iron metabolism have been shown. We evaluated hematological and iron status at diagnosis (T0) and the effect of enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) on erythropoiesis and iron utilization over 5-year follow-up in type 1 GD patients and in an ex vivo model of erythropoiesis from CD34 + peripheral blood cells. At T0, 41% of patients had anemia and 51% hyperferritinemia. Hemoglobin increased from 12.6 (T0) to 13.9 g/dL (T6), GFD15, a marker of ineffective erythropoiesis, decreased from 5401 to 710 pg/ml, and serum ferritin decreased from 614 to 140 mcg/L (p < 0.001). In parallel, transferrin saturation (TSAT) increased. Hepcidin, although in the normal range, decreased from T0 to T6. Ex vivo studies showed that ERT restores the erythroid cells derived from CD34 + impaired ability to differentiate. During ERT, an increase in TFRC expression, consistent with the ability of erythroid precursors to uptake iron, and a reduction in HAMP and concomitant increase in SLC40A1 were observed. This is the largest study with a longitudinal follow-up evaluating erythropoiesis and iron metabolism, combining clinical and ex vivo data in GD. Iron dysregulation likely contributes to anemia, and ERT, by improving iron distribution, improves erythropoiesis.","Irene Motta, Paola Delbini, Natalia Scaramellini, Viola Ghiandai, Lorena Duca, Isabella Nava, Fabio Nascimbeni, Simonetta Lugari, Dario Consonni, Elena Trombetta, Valeria Di Stefano, Margherita Migone De Amicis, Elena Cassinerio, Francesca Carubbi, Maria Domenica Cappellini",2024

Therapeutic delivery of recombinant glucocerebrosidase enzyme-containing extracellular vesicles to human cells from Gaucher disease patients.,"Gaucher disease (GD) is one of the most common types of lysosomal storage diseases (LSDs) caused by pathogenic variants of lysosomal β-glucocerebrosidase gene (GBA1), resulting in the impairment of Glucocerebrosidase (GCase) enzyme function and the accumulation of a glycolipid substrate, glucosylceramide (GlcCer) within lysosomes. Current therapeutic approaches such as enzyme replacement therapy and substrate reduction therapy cannot fully rescue GD pathologies, especially neurological symptoms. Meanwhile, delivery of lysosomal enzymes to the endocytic compartment of affected human cells is a promising strategy for treating neuropathic LSDs.","Keatdamrong Janpipatkul, Nareerat Sutjarit, Amornrat Tangprasittipap, Tai Chaiamarit, Pawarit Innachai, Kanoknetr Suksen, Tanida Chokpanuwat, Thipwimol Tim-Aroon, Usanarat Anurathapan, Natee Jearawiriyapaisarn, Alisa Tubsuwan, Supareak Bowornpinyo, Nithi Asavapanumas, Arthit Chairoungdua, Kanit Bhukhai, Suradej Hongeng",2024
Transition of patients with Gaucher disease type 1 from pediatric to adult care: results from two international surveys of patients and health care professionals.,"Gaucher disease (GD) is a rare, autosomal recessive lysosomal storage disorder caused by a deficiency in the enzyme glucocerebrosidase. The most common subtype in Europe and the USA, type 1 (GD1), is characterized by fatigue, cytopenia, splenomegaly, hepatomegaly, bone disease, and rarely pulmonary disease. Increased life expectancy brought about by improved treatments has led to new challenges for adolescents and their transition to adult care. Efficient healthcare transition to adult care is essential to manage the long-term age-related complications of the disease.","Karolina M Stepien, Irena Žnidar, Beata Kieć-Wilk, Angel Jones, Daniela Castillo-García, Magy Abdelwahab, Shoshana Revel-Vilk, Ella Lineham, Derralynn Hughes, Uma Ramaswami, Tanya Collin-Histed",2024
"Deletion of GBA in neurons, but not microglia, causes neurodegeneration in a Gaucher mouse model.","Gaucher disease, the most prevalent lysosomal storage disease, is caused by homozygous mutations at the GBA gene, responsible for encoding the enzyme glucocerebrosidase. Neuronopathic Gaucher disease is associated with microgliosis, astrogliosis, and neurodegeneration. However, the role that microglia, astrocytes, and neurons play in the disease remains to be determined. In the current study, we developed novel, inducible, cell-type specific GBA KO mice to understand the individual impacts of GBA deficiencies on microglia and neurons. GBA was conditionally knocked out either exclusively in microglia or neurons, or throughout the body. These novel mouse models were developed using a tamoxifen-inducible Cre system, with tamoxifen administration commencing at weaning. Microglia-specific GBA KO mice showed no signs of disease. However, the neuron-specific GBA KO resulted in a shortened lifespan, severe weight loss, and ataxia. These mice also had significant neurodegeneration, microgliosis, and astrogliosis accompanied by the accumulation of glucosylceramide and glucosylsphingosine, recapitulating Gaucher disease-like symptoms. These surprising findings reveal that, unlike the neuron-specific GBA deficiency, microglia-specific GBA deficiency alone does not induce disease. The novel neuronal Gaucher disease mouse model, with a median survival of 16 weeks, may be useful for future studies of pathogenesis and the evaluation of therapies.","Hannah B D Duffy, Colleen Byrnes, Hongling Zhu, Galina Tuymetova, Y Terry Lee, Frances M Platt, Richard L Proia",2024
Striking and widespread microglial activation in the brains of Southdown lambs with type II glucocerebrosidosis (neuronopathic Gaucher disease).,"Glucocerebrosidosis (termed Gaucher disease in humans) is a lysosomal storage disease, caused by a deficiency of the enzyme glucocerebrosidase, which results in accumulation of the glycolipid substrate glucocerebroside in the macrophage-monocyte system. Three principal forms are recognized in humans, two being neuronopathic and resulting in neurodegeneration. Only two spontaneously arising cases have been described in domestic animals, one in a dog and the other in a flock of Southdown sheep. Since microglial activation is increasingly being recognized as having an important role in the pathogenesis of Gaucher disease and archival brains were available from lambs with type II glucocerebrosidosis, we wanted to determine whether microglia were activated in these brains. Ionized calcium binding adaptor molecule 1 (Iba1), a specific and the most widely expressed immunohistochemical marker of microglial activation, was used. Striking and widely distributed activation of microglia was demonstrated, suggesting that microglia actively participate in the development of neuropathological changes in ovine Gaucher disease. This aspect of Gaucher disease requires further study in any future cases detected in domestic animal species, including the mechanism by which this markedly increased Iba1 expression is related to disease progression.","John Finnie, Kim Hemsley, Jim Manavis, Helen Beard, John Brealey, Thomas Robertson, Peter Blumbergs",2024

Upregulation of NFE2L1 reduces ROS levels and α-synuclein aggregation caused by GBA1 knockdown.,"Biallelic mutations in the GBA1 gene result in Gaucher disease (GD), and both patients with GD and carriers of a single GBA1 mutation have an increased susceptibility to Parkinson's disease (PD), but the underlying mechanisms of this association are not yet clear. In previous studies, we established Gba1 F213I point mutation mice and found that homozygous Gba1 F213I mutant mice died shortly after birth, while heterozygous mice could survive normally. In this study, we investigated the transcriptomic changes in the brain tissue of Gba1 F213I heterozygous mice, identifying 138 differentially expressed genes. Among them, Nfe2l1 was the most significantly downregulated gene. Inhibition or knockdown of GBA1 in BE(2)-M17 cells resulted in decreased expression levels of NFE2L1. Knockdown of GBA1 or NFE2L1 could lead to an elevation in intracellular aggregation of α-synuclein (α-syn) and reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels, while upregulation of NFE2L1 effectively mitigated those cellular manifestations induced by GBA1 knockdown. In summary, our in vitro results showed that upregulation of NFE2L1 may provide a therapeutic benefit for cellular phenotypes resulting from GBA1 knockdown, providing new insights for future research on GD and GBA1-associated PD.","Yajun Li, Shuxia Wen, Wanqing Xiang, Fei Shen, Nan Jiang, Jin Zhang, Duan Ma",2024
Pediatric Gaucher Disease Type 3 Presenting with Oculomotor Apraxia: A Case Report.,"We report on a 4-year-old boy affected by Gaucher disease (GD) type 3, who presented with splenomegaly and a history of oculomotor apraxia. GD is a rare lysosomal storage disorder caused by glucocerebrosidase deficiency with multi-organ involvement. Besides common clinical features such as hepatosplenomegaly and skeletal involvement, less frequent neurological symptoms, such as oculomotor apraxia, are indicative of neuronopathic forms of the disease, namely GD type 3, to be confirmed both by enzyme activity and genetic testing. Overall, GD management requires a multidisciplinary approach involving metabolic pediatricians, neurologists, psychologists, and geneticists, and currently relies on early enzyme replacement therapy. Although enzyme replacement therapy has proved to be effective in improving systemic signs and symptoms, it is unable to alleviate neurological complications once these have occurred, as it does not pass across the blood-brain barrier. Neurological improvements may occur through indirect mechanisms. Thus, our case report aims to highlight the importance of considering GD in the differential diagnosis of pediatric patients presenting with splenomegaly associated with neurological manifestations, as early intervention may significantly modify the disease progression and prevent further irreversible complications.","Margherita Di Costanzo, Nicoletta de Paulis, Giuseppe Cannalire, Nicola Morelli, Giacomo Biasucci",2024
Machine Learning-Driven Biomarker Discovery for Skeletal Complications in Type 1 Gaucher Disease Patients.,"Type 1 Gaucher disease (GD1) is a rare, autosomal recessive disorder caused by glucocerebrosidase deficiency. Skeletal manifestations represent one of the most debilitating and potentially irreversible complications of GD1. Although imaging studies are the gold standard, early diagnostic/prognostic tools, such as molecular biomarkers, are needed for the rapid management of skeletal complications. This study aimed to identify potential protein biomarkers capable of predicting the early diagnosis of bone skeletal complications in GD1 patients using artificial intelligence. An in silico study was performed using the novel Therapeutic Performance Mapping System methodology to construct mathematical models of GD1-associated complications at the protein level. Pathophysiological characterization was performed before modeling, and a data science strategy was applied to the predicted protein activity for each protein in the models to identify classifiers. Statistical criteria were used to prioritize the most promising candidates, and 18 candidates were identified. Among them, PDGFB, IL1R2, PTH and CCL3 (MIP-1α) were highlighted due to their ease of measurement in blood. This study proposes a validated novel tool to discover new protein biomarkers to support clinician decision-making in an area where medical needs have not yet been met. However, confirming the results using in vitro and/or in vivo studies is necessary.","Jorge J Cebolla, Pilar Giraldo, Jessica Gómez, Carmen Montoto, Javier Gervas-Arruga",2024

"A 6-month randomized controlled trial for vitamin E supplementation in pediatric patients with Gaucher disease: Effect on oxidative stress, disease severity and hepatic complications.","Enzymatic deficiency in Gaucher disease (GD) may induce oxidative stress. Vitamin E is the nature's most effective lipid-soluble antioxidant. This prospective clinical trial assessed the oxidant-antioxidant status in Egyptian patients with GD and the efficacy and safety and of vitamin E as an adjuvant antioxidant therapy. Forty children and adolescents with GD on stable doses of enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) were enrolled. Abdominal ultrasonography and transient elastography were performed. Malondialdehyde (MDA), vitamin E, and antioxidant enzymes (reduced glutathione [GSH], superoxide dismutase [SOD], glutathione peroxidase [GPx], and peroxiredoxin 2 [PRDX2]) were assessed. Patients were compared with 40 age- and sex-matched healthy controls. Patients with GD were randomized either to receive oral vitamin E for 6 months or not. All patients with GD had significantly higher MDA levels with lower levels of vitamin E and antioxidant enzymes compared with healthy controls (p < 0.001). Vitamin E and PRDX2 were negatively correlated to severity score index (SSI), lyso GL1, and MDA. After 6 months of vitamin E supplementation, SSI and liver and spleen volumes and liver stiffness were significantly lower. Lyso GL1 and MDA were significantly decreased post-vitamin E therapy while antioxidant enzymes were significantly higher compared with baseline levels and with patients without vitamin E therapy. Oxidative stress is related to disease severity in pediatric patients with GD. A 6-month vitamin E supplementation for those patients represents a safe therapeutic adjuvant agent increasing the efficacy of ERT, reducing oxidative stress, and improving outcomes.","Amira Abdel Moneam Adly, Eman Abdel Rahman Ismail, Fatma A Ibrahim, Mira Atef, Khaled Anwar El Sayed, Nihal Hussien Aly",2024

Efficacy of an AAV vector encoding a thermostable form of glucocerebrosidase in alleviating symptoms in a Gaucher disease mouse model.,"Almost all attempts to date at gene therapy approaches for monogenetic disease have used the amino acid sequences of the natural protein. In the current study, we use a designed, thermostable form of glucocerebrosidase (GCase), the enzyme defective in Gaucher disease (GD), to attempt to alleviate neurological symptoms in a GD mouse that models type 3 disease, i.e. the chronic neuronopathic juvenile subtype. Upon injection of an AAVrh10 (adeno-associated virus, serotype rh10) vector containing the designed GCase (dGCase) into the left lateral ventricle of Gba<sup>-/-</sup>;Gba<sup>tg</sup> mice, a significant improvement in body weight and life-span was observed, compared to injection of the same mouse with the wild type enzyme (wtGCase). Moreover, a reduction in levels of glucosylceramide (GlcCer), and an increase in levels of GCase activity were seen in the right hemisphere of Gba<sup>-/-</sup>;Gba<sup>tg</sup> mice, concomitantly with a significant improvement in motor function, reduction of neuroinflammation and a reduction in mRNA levels of various genes shown previously to be elevated in the brain of mouse models of neurological forms of GD. Together, these data pave the way for the possible use of modified proteins in gene therapy for lysosomal storage diseases and other monogenetic disorders.","Ivan Milenkovic, Shani Blumenreich, Ariel Hochfelder, Aviya Azulay, Inbal E Biton, Mirie Zerbib, Roni Oren, Michael Tsoory, Tammar Joseph, Sarel J Fleishman, Anthony H Futerman",2024

Gaucher disease provides a unique window into Parkinson disease pathogenesis.,"An exciting development in the field of neurodegeneration is the association between the rare monogenic disorder Gaucher disease and the common complex disorder Parkinson disease (PD). Gaucher disease is a lysosomal storage disorder resulting from an inherited deficiency of the enzyme glucocerebrosidase, encoded by GBA1, which hydrolyses the glycosphingolipids glucosylceramide and glucosylsphingosine. The observation of parkinsonism in a rare subgroup of individuals with Gaucher disease first directed attention to the role of glucocerebrosidase deficiency in the pathogenesis of PD. PD occurs more frequently in people heterozygous for Gaucher GBA1 mutations, and 3-25% of people with Parkinson disease carry a GBA1 variant. However, only a small percentage of individuals with GBA1 variants develop parkinsonism, suggesting that the penetrance is low. Despite over a decade of intense research in this field, including clinical and radiological evaluations, genetic studies and investigations using model systems, the mechanism underlying GBA1-PD is still being pursued. Insights from this association have emphasized the role of lysosomal pathways in parkinsonism. Furthermore, different therapeutic strategies considered or developed for Gaucher disease can now inform drug development for PD.","Ellen Hertz, Yu Chen, Ellen Sidransky",2024
