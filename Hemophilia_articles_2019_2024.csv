Saliva from persons with hemophilia A triggers coagulation via extrinsic tenase complexes.,"Human saliva contains extracellular vesicles (EVs). These EVs expose extrinsic tenase complexes of tissue factor (TF) and activated factor VII (FVIIa), and trigger blood coagulation. Here, we show that EVs exposing extrinsic tenase complexes are also present in saliva of persons with severe hemophilia A, i.e. persons with FVIII deficiency. Addition of these salivary EVs to autologous FVIII-deficient blood results in FXa generation, thereby compensating for the lack of FXa generation via intrinsic tenase (FVIIIa/FIXa) complexes. Consistently, in our retrospective analysis of persons with severe hemophilia A who do not perform prophylactic FVIII substitution, oropharyngeal mucosal bleedings are infrequent and self-limited. Conversely, in saliva from persons with severe FVII deficiency, in whom oropharyngeal bleedings are prevalent, functional extrinsic tenase complexes are absent, because EVs lack FVII. Saliva from persons with severe FVII deficiency is unable to restore blood coagulation, which is due to the absence of FVII in both their saliva and blood. Picomolar levels of recombinant FVIIa can restore the coagulant potential of saliva from FVII deficient persons. Taken together, our findings may explain the paucity of oropharyngeal bleedings in persons with hemophilia A as well as the occurrence of such bleedings in persons with severe FVII deficiency.","Johannes Thaler, Carla Tripisciano, Daniel Kraemmer, Chi Hau, Nazanin Samadi, Wolfram Ruf, Ingrid Pabinger, Paul Knöbl, Rienk Nieuwland, Cihan Ay",2024

Superior Prophylactic Effectiveness of a Recombinant FVIIIFc Over Standard Half-Life FVIII in Hemophilia A: A-SURE Study.,"The 24-month, prospective, non-interventional, European multicenter A-SURE study evaluated the real-world effectiveness of prophylaxis using an extended half-life recombinant factor VIII (FVIII) Fc fusion protein, efmoroctocog alfa (hereinafter rFVIIIFc), compared with prophylaxis using standard half-life (SHL) FVIII products in patients with hemophilia A.","Johannes Oldenburg, Charles Hay, Flora Peyvandi, Annarita Tagliaferri, Pål Andrè Holme, María Teresa Álvarez-Román, Christine Biron-Andréani, Håkan Malmström, Linda Bystrická, Stefan Lethagen",2024
A transposable element prevents severe hemophilia B and provides insights into the evolution of new- and old world primates.,"Alu-elements comprise a large part of the human genome and some insertions have been shown to cause diseases. Here, we illuminate the protective role of an Alu-element in the 3'UTR of the human Factor 9 gene and its ability to ameliorate a poly(A) site mutation in a hemophilia B patient, preventing him from developing a severe disease. Using a minigene, we examined the disease-causing mutation and the modifying effect of the transposon in cellulo. Further, we simulated evolutionary scenarios regarding alternative polyadenylation before and after Alu insertion. A sequence analysis revealed that Old World monkeys displayed a highly conserved polyadenylation sites in this Alu-element, whereas New World monkeys lacked this motif, indicating a selective pressure. We conclude that this transposon has inserted shortly before the separation of Old and New World monkeys and thus also serves as a molecular landmark in primate evolution.","Johannes Kopp, Alice Rovai, Michael Ott, Heiner Wedemeyer, Andreas Tiede, Hans Jürgen Böhmer, Tomas Marques, Jörg Langemeier, Jens Bohne, Simon Alexander Krooss",2024
Real-world experience of emicizumab prophylaxis in Korean children with severe hemophilia A without inhibitors.,"Hemophilia A is a genetic disorder characterized by a lack of factor VIII (FVIII).

In this article, we present data on an initial real-world evaluation of emicizumab use in Korean children with severe hemophilia A without inhibitors.","Sung Eun Kim, Ji Yoon Kim, Jeong A Park, Chuhl Joo Lyu, Seung Min Hahn, Jung Woo Han, Young Shil Park",2024
Non-accidental trauma in the setting of hemophilia A - A case report.,"Hundreds of thousands of children are victims of non-accidental trauma each year. Its presentation can vary, and it may be difficult to recognize. However, due to its increased risk for fatality, it is imperative that physicians are aware and receptive to the signs of non-accidental trauma to assist with early detection. In a similar fashion, bleeding disorders vary in their presentations and their severity. They also have the potential to occur in the setting of non-accidental trauma, further complicating the diagnosis, increasing morbidity, and mortality. Due to this, suspicion and evaluation for non-accidental trauma should be followed by a bleeding disorder work-up. This case follows a child with undiagnosed Hemophilia-A in the setting of suspected non-accidental trauma. It not only highlights the variation of presentations seen with these ailments but demonstrates the importance of evaluating for comorbidities in highly fatal conditions.","Kameron Williamson, Thomas Weber, Meggan Goodpasture, Amanda Blair",2024

Induction of factor VIII tolerance by hemophilia gene transfer to eradicate factor VIII inhibitors.,"Patients with hemophilia A can develop anti-factor antibodies to factor VIII. The incidence is ~30% and such patients suffer worse morbidity and mortality. The only proven method to eradicate these inhibitors is via immune tolerance induction therapy which consists of infusing factor VIII concentrates at a regular intervals. This approach is effective ~65% of the time leaving at least a third of patients who develop inhibitors with this lifelong problem. Although emicizumab has greatly improved the quality of life of inhibitor patients, eradicating the inhibitor remains an important treatment goal. Animal models have shown the potential for gene therapy to induce tolerance. A recent abstract describing a study in humans demonstrated the potential for successful tolerance induction. This article will describe the rationale for utilizing gene therapy to induce tolerance and provide this author's viewpoint on the importance and possible historic significance of attempting to eradicate inhibitors with this approach.",Guy Young,2024
Patient Experience With Efanesoctocog Alfa for Severe Hemophilia A: Results From the XTEND-1 Phase 3 Clinical Study Exit Interviews.,"Hemophilia A is a rare bleeding disorder that leads to recurrent hemarthrosis, which can ultimately result in reduced mobility and poor quality of life. Qualitative exit interviews provide insights into patient perspectives and support the interpretation of quantitative trial data, such as patient-reported outcome measures. In the Phase 3 XTEND-1 study (NCT04161495) of efanesoctocog alfa in participants with severe hemophilia A, exit interviews were conducted to understand pre- and post-study experiences with pain and physical functioning and to evaluate participants' treatment experiences.","Dana DiBenedetti, Daniela Neme, Brigitte Pan-Petesch, Annemieke Willemze, Tung Wynn, Nana Kragh, Amanda Wilson",2024

[Acquired hemophilia - quick diagnosis and treatment can significantly reduce the risk of mortality].,"This case report of a 73-year-old male with bleedings provides insights into the clinical characteristics, diagnosis och treatment of acquired hemophilia A. It's a dangerous non-hereditary bleeding disorder caused by autoantibodies against coagulation factor VIII, often linked with other autoimmune diseases or malignancies, but it is also often idiopathic. The diagnosis remains a challenge due to its rarity and non-specific symtoms, but should be considered in unexplained bleeding cases with prolonged activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT). Quick  diagnosis and treatment can significantly reduce the risk of serious complications and mortality. The long-term prognosis usually depends on the presence of any underlying disease.","Jolene Johansson, Mårten Söderberg",2024
Spontaneous postoperative bleeding after periodontal procedure: An alarming sign of bleeding disorder.,"The prevalence of inherited bleeding disorders (BDs) is low in the general population (10-20 per 100,000 individuals), particularly hemophilia B cases, which may remain undiagnosed for a very long time until exposed to some surgical procedure. The dental professional must be aware of the possibility that patients with no previous history of abnormal bleeding may manifest their first bleeding episode in the dental office. Particularly as periodontists, we often encounter patients with bleeding gums and severe bleeding complications may precipitate while performing routine periodontal procedures. Hence, we must have a thorough knowledge of BDs and their management in challenging hemorrhagic situations. Management of such patients necessitates a multidisciplinary approach by involving the patient's hematologist and advanced laboratory facilities. The present case report is an attempt to discuss the diagnosis and management of a bleeding episode that occurred post periodontal flap surgery in an undiagnosed hemophilia B patient.","Shivani Mishra, Madhu Singh Ratre, Parul Jain",2024
A Novel Murine Model Enabling rAAV8-PC Gene Therapy for Severe Protein C Deficiency.,"Severe protein C deficiency (SPCD) is a rare inherited thrombotic disease associated with high morbidity and mortality. In the current study, we established a viable murine model of SPCD, enabling preclinical gene therapy studies. By creating SPCD mice with severe hemophilia A (PROC<sup>-/-</sup>/F8<sup>-</sup>), the multi-month survival of SPCD mice enabled the exploration of recombinant adeno-associated viral vector-PC (rAAV8-PC) gene therapy (GT). rAAV8- PC (10<sup>12</sup> vg/kg of AAV8-PC) was injected via the tail vein into 6-8-week-old PROC<sup>-/-</sup>/F8<sup>-</sup> mice. Their plasma PC antigen levels (median of 714 ng/mL, range 166-2488 ng/mL) and activity (303.5 ± 59%) significantly increased to the normal range after GT compared to untreated control animals. PC's presence in the liver after GT was also confirmed by immunofluorescence staining. Our translational research results provide the first proof of concept that an infusion of rAAV8-PC increases PC antigen and activity in mice and may contribute to future GT in SPCD. Further basic research of SPCD mice with prolonged survival due to the rebalancing of this disorder using severe hemophilia A may provide essential data regarding PC's contribution to specific tissues' development, local PC generation, and its regulation in inflammatory conditions.","Sarina Levy-Mendelovich, Einat Avishai, Benjamin J Samelson-Jones, Rima Dardik, Tami Brutman-Barazani, Yael Nisgav, Tami Livnat, Gili Kenet",2024
Perioperative Pain Management in Hemophilic Patient Undergoing Orthopedic Surgery: A Narrative Review.,"Hemophilia type A and B is associated with spontaneous bleeding in muscle tissues and joints. Acute hemarthrosis, representing 70-80% of all bleedings in severe hemophilia patients, is extremely painful. When surgical procedures are needed in hemophiliac patients, perioperative management should be planned with a multidisciplinary team.

Comprehensive Evaluation of Anti-Emicizumab Antibodies in Acquired Hemophilia A: A Detailed Case Study and Methodological Evaluation.,"Acquired hemophilia A (AHA) is a rare and severe bleeding disorder characterized by autoantibodies inhibiting coagulation factor VIII (FVIII). Current treatment of AHA involves bypassing agents, or FVIII replacement therapy, yet their efficacy is limited in cases of high inhibitor titers. Emicizumab, a humanized bispecific monoclonal antibody, has shown promising hemostatic effectiveness in congenital hemophilia A (HA) patients and AHA, but a minority of patients developed anti-drug antibodies (ADAs), compromising its efficacy.","Behnaz Pezeshkpoor, Nadja Sereda, Janine Becker-Gotot, Ann-Cristin Berkemeier, Isabell Matuschek, Jens Müller, Samhitha Urs Ramaraje Urs, Sneha Singh, Claudia Klein, Natascha Marquardt, Johannes Oldenburg",2024
Factor Replacement Treatment for Hemophilia A: Achievements and Perspectives.,"The mainstay of treatment for persons with hemophilia A (PwHA) with severe bleeding phenotype is prophylaxis. The pharmacokinetic (PK) profile of native factor VIII (FVIII) imposes the need for rather frequent intravenous injections to ensure effective prophylaxis, but this represents a relevant treatment burden and is associated with suboptimal adherence to treatment. In this light, the advent of extended half-life (EHL) FVIII molecules has improved prophylaxis feasibility and outcomes by favoring treatment individualization and tailoring protection according to specific clinical and nonclinical needs. Different technologies have been used to enhance FVIII PK properties including Fc-fusion and conjugation with polyethylene glycol. Data from clinical development programs for such molecules, together with growing real-world experience, have shown numerous benefits related to the use of EHL FVIII in PwHA. Recently a new class of ultra-long-acting EHL FVIII has been developed to further improve protection against bleeding episodes and achieve the ambitious goal of providing PwHA with hemostatic protection in the nonhemophilia range over longer time periods, hence ensuring very low bleeding rates and improving joint health and quality of life. In this review, the achievements and perspectives of replacement therapies for PwHA are summarized and discussed.",Maria Elisa Mancuso,2024
Postpartum Acquired Hemophilia A.,"Acquired hemophilia A (AHA) is a bleeding disorder that occurs from aberrant production of autoantibodies that target factor VIII. The underlying cause of AHA is unclear but can present postpartum. Very few cases have reported instances of AHA coexisting with other hematological disorders, such as sickle cell trait (SCT). Although rare and no direct correlation between the two, critical situations involving intractable bleeding can intensify the severity of these disorders. A 31-year-old pregnant female with a medical history significant for SCT presented to the hospital for a C-section. Shortly after the procedure she experienced intractable bleeding from multiple sites. Initial lab work yielded an isolated increase in activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT). Further investigation showed abnormal mixing studies, reduced factor VIII activity and the presence of factor VIII antibodies. The patient was diagnosed with postpartum AHA (PAH) and treated with activated Factor VII and prednisone. PAH is an uncommon bleeding disorder that commonly occurs one to four months postpartum and presents as excessive bleeding elevated aPTT, abnormal mixing studies, and reduced factor VIII levels with abnormally high inhibitor levels. Despite an unknown identifiable etiology, treatment hinges upon establishing hemostasis and eradicating the aberrant generated factor VIII inhibitors. The association of AHA and other hematological disorders is not yet elucidated.","Khawaja O Omar, William Sebastian, Suzanne Kemper",2024

Can hemophilia be cured? It depends on the definition.,"Over the years, the palette of treatment options for hemophilia has grown extensively, leading to an increased life expectancy and quality of life for people living with hemophilia. Nonetheless, it is frequently emphasized that none of the current treatment modalities provides a ""cure."" It is therefore hoped that innovative treatments such as gene therapy may bridge this void. However, the precise definition of a ""cure"" for hemophilia remains unclear. In this review, we show how the concept of cure is currently used in the field of hemophilia. We then relate the discussion on cure to debates surrounding the classification of hemophilia and philosophical debates on the concepts of health and disease.","Lieke Baas, Rieke van der Graaf, Karina Meijer",2024
Current Diagnosis of Bleeding Disorders in Lower Income Countries.,"There have been considerable advances in diagnosing and treating bleeding disorders. But the scenario remains dismal in resource-constrained settings in low and lower-middle-income countries (LMICs). Seventy-five percent of the patients with inherited bleeding disorders do not get diagnosed in LMICs. In resource-constrained settings, infectious disease and malignancies take the major focus. Bleeding disorders do not get prioritised in LMICs, and this leads to underdiagnoses and suboptimal treatment. There are various challenges like financial status, inadequacy of health care infrastructure, lack of patient registry and lack of awareness across medical staff, general population and government stakeholders. The lack of skilled laboratory personnel and laboratory infrastructure for optimal bleeding disorder diagnosis adds on to the problem. World Federation of Hemophilia (WFH) has been at the forefront in developing strategies to overcome some of these inadequacies; however, more active participation of the stakeholders including patients, medical professionals and policy makers is the need of the hour. This review highlights the different challenges in LMICs in diagnosing bleeding disorders, the gap between high-income countries and LMICs and the possible strategies in closing the gap.","Deepak K Mishra, Asish Rath, Mayur Parihar, Sushant S Vinarkar, Anirban Kundu",2024
Severe Hemophilic Arthropathy of the Knee: MRI Has Its Place.,"Hemophilia is a congenital coagulopathy characterized by a deficiency of coagulation factors and the development of haematomas and haemarthrosis, either spontaneously or after minor trauma. Recurrent joint hemorrhage in hemophilia patients leads to progressive and degenerative arthropathy, which affects around 90% of patients with severe disease and contributes significantly to disease morbidity. Positive diagnosis is based on biology. Imaging, particularly MRI, plays an essential role in assessing the evolution and complications, especially osteoarticular complications. We report 2 cases of severe hemophilia A, who presented with almost identical clinical and radiological symptoms. The patients developed severe arthropathy with a course marked by recurrences of haemarthrosis.","Eric Michel Charlemagne Junior Kessi, Kaoutar Maslouhi, Yousra Guelzim, Lina Belkouchi, Nazik Allali, Latifa Chat, Siham El Haddad",2024
"Future needs for continuing innovation in hemophilia: improving outcomes for individuals of all severities, including women and those in resource-constrained regions.","Over recent decades, management of people with hemophilia (PwH) has been greatly improved by scientific advances that have resulted in a rich and varied therapeutic landscape. Nevertheless, treatment limitations continue to drive innovation, and emerging options have the potential to realize further improvement. We advocate four general principles to optimize benefits from innovation: individualizing the treatment approach, targeting 'normal,' making the most of available resources, and considering treatment affordability. Ultimately, all PwH-men and women, of all ages and severities, and worldwide-should have access to treatment that fully prevents bleeding, while allowing personal, social, family, and professional lives of choice. Clearly, we are not there yet, but developing goals/milestones based on the principles we describe may help to achieve this.","Jan Blatný, Jan Astermark, Cristina Catarino, Gerry Dolan, Karin Fijnvandraat, Cédric Hermans, Katharina Holstein, Víctor Jiménez-Yuste, Robert Klamroth, Michelle Lavin, Peter J Lenting, Sébastien Lobet, Maria Elisa Mancuso, Jayashree Motwani, James S O'Donnell, Christoph Königs",2024

Gene Therapy for Hemophilia.,"Concept Gene therapy with adeno-associated virus (AAV) vectors treats hemophilia A or B by delivering a functional F8 or F9 gene to hepatocytes. This single infusion enables endogenous production of FVIII or FIX protein, reducing bleeding in patients. Evolution Long-term clinical studies have provided insight into the efficacy, safety, and durability of AAV-mediated gene therapies for hemophilia A and B. Gene therapies have now been approved for hemophilia A (valoctocogene roxaparvovec) and hemophilia B (etranacogene dezaparvovec; fidanacogene elaparvovec) in select regions. Application The approved gene therapies are associated with a strong reduction in bleeding tendency and increased FVIII or FIX activity levels, without the need for additional FVIII or FIX replacement therapies, in the vast majority of patients. Future Steps Improvements in AAV technology, protein expression, and immunogenicity may render AAV-mediated gene therapies more efficient, longer lasting and safer for people with hemophilia A or B.","Peter J Lenting, Sylvia Fong",2024
