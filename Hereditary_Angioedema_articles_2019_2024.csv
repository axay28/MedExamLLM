"Hereditary Angioedema and Venous Thromboembolism: Where There's Smoke, There's Fire.","C1-inhibitor deficiency-associated hereditary angioedema (C1INH-HAE) is a rare congenital swelling disorder caused by mutations in the <i>SERPING1</i> gene. Despite evidence of a systemic procoagulant state in C1INH-HAE, dogma held that this disorder was not associated with thrombotic pathologies. Recent population scale epidemiological evidence has directly challenged this, with C1INH-HAE being associated with a significantly increased risk of venous thromboembolism (VTE). This review considers the growing body of evidence supporting associations between HAE and both a systemic procoagulant state and an increased risk of VTE. In the setting of C1INH-HAE, the relationship between the observed procoagulant and thrombotic phenotypes is a prime example of ""where there's smoke, there's fire."" This review also discusses the impact of C1INH-HAE disease modifying therapies on coagulation and VTE. Further, the utility of preclinical mouse models of C1-inhibitor deficiency is considered.",Steven P Grover,2024
Hereditary angioedema due to C1-inhibitor deficiency: current therapeutic approaches.,"For decades, treatment options for hereditary angioedema (HAE) were limited by major adverse effects, insufficient efficacy, and difficult routes of administration. However, the growing body of knowledge regarding HAE pathophysiology has led to the development of innovative drugs for self-administered, on-demand therapy and for short- and long-term prophylaxis. This review provides a comprehensive overview of the approved drugs and the development of HAE treatments.","Giulia Costanzo, Giada Sambugaro, Davide Firinu",2024
"Etiology, Recent Advances, and Clinical Trials Data for the Treatment of Angioedema: A Review.","Angioedema is a health issue that affects parts of the body like the upper pulmonary and gastric pathways and is identified by abrupt, nonpitting enlargement of the skin, mucous membranes, or both. The swelling usually lasts a few hours to 72 hours and may appear as non-puritic, subcutaneous, or submucosal organ edema. It is characterized by localized swelling brought on by the release of histamine. Itching is rare, and usual areas of appearance include the hands, feet, face, and genitalia, with periorbital swelling being the most often. The main objective of this review article is to study in brief the classifications, etiology, pathophysiology, and clinical trial data by describing the recent advancement in the treatment of angioedema. Various research articles obtained from different journals indexed under Scopus and SCI were used to prepare the review article and for illustrative work software such as Biorender and Microsoft Word was used. Histamine-- mediated angioedema, linked to allergic reactions, coexists with urticaria. Bradykinin-mediated angioedema, exemplified by hereditary angioedema and acquired forms, lacks urticaria. Idiopathic angioedema, with uncertain etiology. Imitated angioedema results from non-IgE-mediated reactions, often induced by medications. It is a complicated medical condition with a variety of causes and mechanisms. Over time, outcomes for patients have been greatly improved by a growing understanding of its etiology, pathophysiology, and available treatments. The field of medical treatment for this difficult problem is always changing, and this is partly due to clinical trials.","Mukul Nishad, Sushma Verma, Ramish Maqsood, Rashmi Saxena Pal",2024
Lanadelumab in a kidney transplant patient with hereditary angioedema due to C1-inhibitor deficiency and high cardiovascular risk - a case report.,"Cardiovascular pathologies represent the first cause of death in uremic patients and are among the leading causes of mortality in patients with hereditary angioedema due to C1-inhibitor deficiency (HAE-C1INH). Before 2020, the most common treatment for long-term prophylaxis in HAE-C1INH patients in Italy was attenuated androgen, which may increase cardiovascular risk by multiple mechanisms.","Antonio Gidaro, Leyla La Cava, Mattia Donadoni, Valentina Popescu Janu, Chiara Cogliati, Antonio Luca Brucato, Andrea Zanichelli, Mauro Cancian, Emanuele Bizzi",2024
A novel assay of excess plasma kallikrein-kinin system activation in hereditary angioedema.,"Cleaved high-molecular-weight kininogen (HKa) is a disease state biomarker of kallikrein-kinin system (KKS) activation in patients with hereditary angioedema due to C1 inhibitor deficiency (HAE-C1INH), the endogenous inhibitor of plasma kallikrein (PKa).","Dan Sexton, Ryan Faucette, Melody Rivera-Hernandez, Jon A Kenniston, Nikolaos Papaioannou, Janja Cosic, Kris Kopacz, Gary Salmon, Chantal Beauchemin, Salomé Juethner, Dave Yeung",2024
Hereditary Angioedema in Pregnancy Complicated by Upper Extremity Deep Venous Thrombosis: A Case Report.,"Hereditary angioedema (HAE) is a rare disorder that causes episodes of angioedema due to a mutation in the C1 esterase inhibitor gene (C1-INH). Complications of HAE include intestinal obstruction, asphyxiation, and venous thromboembolism (VTE). In this case, we report a 34-year-old G4P2011 female with HAE at 24 weeks gestation presenting with acute right upper extremity pain and swelling following a peripherally inserted central catheter (PICC) line for HAE treatment infusion, revealing a right upper extremity VTE. Early treatment with Lovenox, PICC line removal, and continuation of HAE therapy via peripheral IV infusion resolved and prevented further angioedema and subsequent VTEs during this patient's pregnancy. This case serves as an example of effective management of HAE complications during pregnancy and supports peripheral IV line usage over PICC lines for medication infusions in pregnant patients with HAE. The overall purpose of this case report is to improve safety outcomes for pregnant patients with HAE by mitigating the risks of PICC line usage and to highlight the significance of VTE inclusion within the differential diagnosis in this population.","Devon H Newton, Alexandria L Betit, Roshni B Patel, Louis DiValentin",2024

Real-world outcomes of patients with hereditary angioedema with normal C1-inhibitor function and patients with idiopathic angioedema of unknown etiology in Canada.,Hereditary angioedema with normal C1-inhibitor function (HAE nC1-INH) and idiopathic angioedema of unknown etiology (AE-UNK) are rare conditions that cause recurrent subcutaneous and submucosal swelling. The characteristics and clinical outcomes of patients with these conditions in Canada have not been studied.,"Adil Adatia, Jean-Nicolas Boursiquot, Dawn Goodyear, Chrystyna Kalicinsky, Amin Kanani, Susan Waserman, Michelle M L Nguyen, Abhinav Wadhwa, Jessica Weiss, Ahmed El-Zoeiby, Stephen Betschel",2024
Targeting factor XIIa for therapeutic interference with hereditary angioedema.,"Hereditary angioedema (HAE) is a rare, potentially life-threatening genetic disorder characterized by recurrent attacks of swelling. Local vasodilation and vascular leakage are stimulated by the vasoactive peptide bradykinin, which is excessively produced due to dysregulation of the activated factor XII (FXIIa)-driven kallikrein-kinin system. There is a need for novel treatments for HAE that provide greater efficacy, improved quality of life, minimal adverse effects, and reduced treatment burden over current first-line therapies. FXIIa is emerging as an attractive therapeutic target for interference with HAE attacks. In this review, we draw on preclinical, experimental animal, and in vitro studies, providing an overview on targeting FXIIa as the basis for pharmacologic interference in HAE. We highlight that there is a range of FXIIa inhibitors in development for different therapeutic areas. Of these, garadacimab, an FXIIa-targeted inhibitory monoclonal antibody, is the most advanced and has shown potential as a novel long-term prophylactic treatment for patients with HAE in clinical trials. The evidence from these trials is summarized and discussed, and we propose areas for future research where targeting FXIIa may have therapeutic potential beyond HAE.","Danny M Cohn, Thomas Renné",2024
Advent of oral medications for the treatment of hereditary angioedema.,"Hereditary angioedema (HAE) is a rare genetic disorder characterized by unpredictable, debilitating episodes of submucosal and/or subcutaneous tissue swelling, which may be life-threatening depending on anatomic location. The two primary management strategies for HAE are ready access to effective on-demand treatment in all patients and the prevention of attacks (short-term prophylaxis [STP] and long-term prophylaxis [LTP]) in appropriate patients. All approved on-demand and most LTP medications require subcutaneous or intravenous administration. Injection-related challenges include trypanophobia (fear of needles), difficulty with self-administration, injection-site reactions (e.g., pain, erythema, bleeding, bruising), and anxiety-all contributing to poor compliance and administration delays. Oral HAE treatments may improve outcomes by reducing treatment barriers.","Anna Valerieva, Teresa Caballero, Markus Magerl, Joao P Frade, Paul K Audhya, Timothy Craig",2024
Clinical profile and management of pediatric hereditary angioedema in resource-constrained settings: our experience from a single centre in North India.,"Hereditary angioedema (HAE) is a rare genetic disorder. The pattern of HAE is different in children as compared to adults. There is limited literature from developing countries where all first-line treatments are either unavailable or not easily accessible. Data of children with HAE were retrieved from medical records of patients registered in the Pediatric Immunodeficiency Clinic at our institute. Of the 206 patients with HAE, 61 were diagnosed before the age of 18 years. Male: female ratio was 1.1:1. Median age at onset of symptoms and diagnosis were 6.2 years (range 1-17 years) and 10.7 years (range 1.5-18 years) respectively. Median delay in diagnosis was 4.9 years (range 0-16 years). The commonest presentation was facial swelling (51/61) followed by swelling of extremities (47/61). Laryngeal edema and abdominal symptoms were reported in 28/61 and 31/61 patients respectively. Abdominal attacks were found to be less common in children as compared to adults. Most patients in our cohort received fresh-frozen plasma (n = 5/61) as on-demand therapy. Long-term prophylaxis included attenuated androgens (n = 25/61) and tranexamic acid (n = 23/61). Median duration of follow-up was 2242 patient months. One patient died on follow-up in this cohort. This is the largest single-centre cohort of pediatric HAE from resource-constrained settings. Facial attacks were more common, and there were significant delays in diagnosis when the age of onset of symptoms was younger. Gastrointestinal symptoms were less common in children than adults. HIGHLIGHTS: One of the largest single-centre cohorts of pediatric HAE and the only one from resource-constrained settings. There were significant delays in diagnosis when the age of onset of symptoms was younger. Abdominal attacks were found to be less common in children as compared to adults.","Ankur Kumar Jindal, Prabal Barman, Suprit Basu, Reva Tyagi, Archan Sil, Sanchi Chawla, Sanghamitra Machhua, Gurjit Kaur, Saniya Sharma, Manpreet Dhaliwal, Anuradha Bishnoi, Keshavmurthy Vinay, Pandiarajan Vignesh, Rakesh Kumar Pilania, Deepti Suri, Ravinder Garg, Amit Rawat, Sendhil M Kumaran, Sunil Dogra, Henriette Farkas, Hilary Longhurst, Surjit Singh",2024

A real-world study of hereditary angioedema patients due to C1 inhibitor deficiency treated with danazol in the Brazilian Public Health System.,"Hereditary angioedema (HAE) due to C1 inhibitor (C1-INH) deficiency is an ultra-rare autosomal dominant inherited disease that affects 1 in 67,000 people in the world. The attacks are based on subcutaneous and submucosal edema that can lead to death if not properly managed. Considering the lack of information on the clinical management of Brazilian patients with HAE, this study aimed to identify and characterize patients with HAE-C1-INH that used danazol prophylactic treatment in the Brazilian Public Health System (SUS) and the healthcare resource utilization (HCRU).","Alessandra Mileni Versuti Ritter, Suelen Silva, Robson de Paula, Juliana Senra, Fabio Carvalho, Tatiane Ribeiro, Solange Oliveira Rodrigues Valle",2024
Immunodeficiency: Complement disorders.,"The complement system is an important component of innate and adaptive immunity that consists of three activation pathways. The classic complement pathway plays a role in humoral immunity, whereas the alternative and lectin pathways augment the innate response. Impairment, deficiency, or overactivation of any of the known 50 complement proteins may lead to increased susceptibility to infection with encapsulated organisms, autoimmunity, hereditary angioedema, or thrombosis, depending on the affected protein. Classic pathway defects result from deficiencies of complement proteins C1q, C1r, C1s, C2, and C4, and typically manifest with features of systemic lupus erythematosus and infections with encapsulated organisms. Alternative pathway defects due to deficiencies of factor B, factor D, and properdin may present with increased susceptibility to Neisseria infections. Lectin pathway defects, including Mannose-binding protein-associated serine protease 2 (MASP2) and ficolin 3, may be asymptomatic or lead to pyogenic infections and autoimmunity. Complement protein C3 is common to all pathways, deficiency of which predisposes patients to severe frequent infections and glomerulonephritis. Deficiencies in factor H and factor I, which regulate the alternative pathway, may lead to hemolytic uremic syndrome. Disseminated Neisseria infections result from terminal pathway defects (i.e., C5, C6, C7, C8, and C9). Diagnosis of complement deficiencies involves screening with functional assays (i.e., total complement activity [CH50], alternative complement pathway activity [AH50], enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay [ELISA]) followed by measurement of individual complement factors by immunoassay. Management of complement deficiencies requires a comprehensive and individualized approach with special attention to vaccination against encapsulated bacteria, consideration of prophylactic antibiotics, treatment of comorbid autoimmunity, and close surveillance.","Jeremy C McMurray, Brandon J Schornack, Andrew L Weskamp, Katherine J Park, Joshua D Pollock, W Grant Day, Aaron T Brockshus, Douglas E Beakes, David J Schwartz, Cecilia P Mikita, Luke M Pittman",2024

Management dilemma: managing bipolar affective disorder in a patient with hereditary angioedema.,"Hereditary angioedema (HAE) is a rare autosomal dominant disorder caused by the deficiency or dysfunction of C1 esterase inhibitors. We present a case of a female in her 50s with HAE and bipolar affective disorder (BPAD). She has experienced severe depressive and manic episodes with significant disruption to her life. She has also had potentially life-threatening episodes of recurrent angioedema with severe facial and body swelling and post-pharyngeal symptoms.She presented to us with a depressive episode with suicidal ideation. Her angioedema was flared by both psychological stressors and psychotropic medications. Choosing the correct mood stabiliser without triggering angioedema was a major challenge in her treatment. Also, psychosocial interventions and frequent liaison with her immunology team were necessary to provide her with optimum care in the community. Here, we discuss the challenges we faced and how we overcame them in managing this rare presentation of coexisting BPAD and HAE.","Isuri Upeksha Wimalasiri, Nikhil Jain, Mahesh Jayaram",2024
Uncovering a novel SERPING1 pathogenic variant: insights into the aggregation of C1-INH in hereditary angioedema.,"Hereditary angioedema (HAE) is a rare autosomal dominant genetic disease characterized by recurrent edema and a potentially fatal risk.

This study aims to thoroughly investigate the underlying pathological mechanisms of HAE and identify potential biomarkers that could aid in its prediction and prevention.","Lingxi Jiang, Chao Dai, Suyang Duan, Tingting Wang, Chunbao Xie, Luhan Zhang, Zimeng Ye, Xiumei Ma, Yi Shi",2024
Early Diagnosis of Hereditary Angioedema in Japan Based on a US Medical Dataset: Algorithm Development and Validation.,"Hereditary angioedema (HAE), a rare genetic disease, induces acute attacks of swelling in various regions of the body. Its prevalence is estimated to be 1 in 50,000 people, with no reported bias among different ethnic groups. However, considering the estimated prevalence, the number of patients in Japan diagnosed with HAE remains approximately 1 in 250,000, which means that only 20% of potential HAE cases are identified.","Kouhei Yamashita, Yuji Nomoto, Tomoya Hirose, Akira Yutani, Akira Okada, Nayu Watanabe, Ken Suzuki, Munenori Senzaki, Tomohiro Kuroda",2024
Analysis of disease burden in patients with hereditary angioedema from Japan by patient-reported outcomes.,"Hereditary angioedema (HAE) symptoms can vary greatly. Disease burden evaluation is essential for providing adequate treatments for patients. Patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs), including the 12-Item Short Form Health Survey (SF-12), the Angioedema Quality of Life (AE-QoL), the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), and the Work Productivity and Activity Impairment: Specific Health Problem (WPAI:SHP) questionnaires, were collected in 2021, before modern medications for long-term prophylaxis (LTP) of HAE were licensed in Japan. Patients also reported their HAE attack frequency as ""annual"" (several attacks annually), ""monthly"" (several attacks monthly) or ""weekly"" (several attacks weekly). Multiple linear regression analyses were conducted on the relationship between independent parameters (sex, age, attack frequency, HAE type, and HADS scores) and dependent parameters (AE-QoL and SF-12 scores). Fifty-four patients reported PROMs. All PROMs showed substantial health-related quality of life (HRQoL) impairment. Overall, the higher the attack frequencies, the greater the reported impairment in the PROMs tended to be. In multiple linear regression analyses, higher AE-QoL Fatigue/Mood and Fears/Shame domain scores (greater impairment) were associated with higher HADS anxiety subscale scores; higher AE-QoL total scores (greater HRQoL impairment) and lower SF-12 Physical and Mental Health Composite scores (greater general health impairment) were associated with higher HADS depression subscale scores. Patients with monthly or weekly HAE attacks reported numerically low absenteeism and numerically high presenteeism and work productivity loss as measured by the WPAI:SHP questionnaire. In this study, conducted before modern LTP options were available in Japan, patients with HAE reported notable impairment in HRQoL and work productivity. Weekly or monthly HAE attack frequencies were associated with a high disease burden. Furthermore, a substantial number of patients reported notable fatigue/mood impairment as measured by the AE-QoL and depression as measured by the HADS regardless of attack frequency. These results provide a basis for future studies evaluating the effect of LTP on the clinical manifestations and HRQoL in patients with HAE.","Michihiro Hide, Miwa Kishimoto, Ippei Kotera, Akinori Oh, Yoichi Inoue, Beverley Anne Yamamoto, Shinichi Noto",2024
Hereditary Angioedema in Pregnancy: A Case Report and Review of Obstetric Anesthesia Management.,"Hereditary angioedema (HAE) is a rare disorder due to C1 esterase inhibitor deficiency, causing recurrent swelling. Pregnancy can exacerbate HAE due to estrogen fluctuations alongside peripartum stress and trauma. We present a pregnant patient with HAE who underwent induction of labor and vaginal delivery with neuraxial anesthesia. Management included C1-inhibitor prophylaxis, 48 hours of postpartum monitoring, and a self-treatment plan at discharge. Angioedema prevention involves timely anesthesia consultation, accessible emergency airway equipment, early neuraxial anesthesia, planned vaginal delivery, and 48 to 72 hours of close postpartum monitoring. Readily available C1-inhibitor and a multidisciplinary approach with these recommendations are crucial for peripartum management.","Micah K de Valle, Cooper Stevenson, Michael Adkison, Christy Delaune, Nicholas Defilippis, Shobana Murugan",2024

Hereditary angioedema presented as isolated ascending and transverse colon swelling mimicking acute abdomen.,"Hereditary angioedema (HAE) is a rare autosomal dominant condition characterized by C1-INH gene mutations, leading to recurrent angioedema episodes affecting various body parts, including the gastrointestinal tract. This case report describes a 24-year-old female presenting with symptoms mimicking an acute abdomen, characterized by severe abdominal cramps, anorexia, and diarrhea, with a significant past medical history of angioedema flares and emergency intubation for asphyxiation at age 11. Despite initial treatment with antihistamines showing no improvement, her symptoms spontaneously resolved. Further investigation revealed low complement C4 levels and reduced C1-INH function, confirming HAE with an unusual isolated involvement of the ascending and transverse colon. This case underscores the importance of considering HAE in patients presenting with acute abdominal symptoms, especially with a history suggestive of angioedema. It highlights the need for emergency physicians and gastroenterologists to be aware of HAE's clinical manifestations to avoid misdiagnosis and unnecessary interventions. Moreover, the case emphasizes the significance of patient education on recognizing symptoms and seeking timely medical attention to prevent severe complications. This report adds to the existing literature by detailing an uncommon presentation of HAE, aiming to enhance early diagnosis and management of this potentially life-threatening condition.","Mohammad Marrawani, Mustafa Alatawneh, Fouad Asafra, Omar H Salloum, Ahmad M Abuayash, Mosab Samamra",2024

[Two pediatric hereditary angioedemathe families: case report and literature review].,"<b>Objective:</b> To summarize the clinical characteristics of two families with hereditary angioedema in children. <b>Methods:</b> A retrospective analysis was conducted on the general information, clinical manifestations, genetic variations, and laboratory test results of two families diagnosed with hereditary angioedema at Department of Rheumatology and Immunology, Shenzhen Children's Hospital from December 2022 to May 2023. And using keywords such as ""children"" ""adolescent"" ""infant"" ""toddler"" ""pediatric"" ""hereditary angioedema"" search for relevant literature from VIP, Wanfang, CNKI, PubMed, Web of Science and Google Scholar from the establishment of the database until January 2024 and summarize the diagnosis and clinical characteristics of hereditary angioed in children. <b>Results:</b> Case 1, female, 12 years old, presented with intermittent abdominal pain for 8 years, aggravated with vomiting for 2 days. Eight years ago, without a clear cause, case 1 experienced abdominal pain and underwent two abdominal surgeries. The concentration of C1 esterase inhibitor was 0.46 g/L, and the function of C1 esterase inhibitor was less than 0.01. The SERPING1 gene had a c.1396C>G variation, and she was diagnosed with hereditary angioedema type Ⅱ. Among the other 13 family members, 8 had swelling in different parts, and 2 had died. Case 2, female, 17 years old, was diagnosed with hereditary angioedema type Ⅰ due to intermittent limb swelling for more than 2 years. She had C4 of 0.09 g/L, C1 esterase inhibitor concentration of 0.05 g/L, C1 esterase inhibitor function <0.01, SERPING1 gene c.882C>G variation. Two out of the other 12 family members experienced intermittent skin swelling. Literature review meets the search criteria with 0 Chinese literature and 15 English literature, including a total of 524 cases of hereditary angioedema in children. Combined with 2 families in this group, there are 5 families with hereditary angioedema in children as the proband. The onset time is 1-15 years old, and the diagnosis delay time is -0.9 to 20.0 years. Two hundred and sixty-three cases (50.2%) of the children had a family history survey, of which 229 cases (87.1%) had a positive family history. Two hundred and fifty-seven cases (49.0%) had clear disease classification, with type Ⅰ being the main type, accounting for 234 cases (91.1%). The clinical symptoms of 296 children (56.5%) were described in detail, including 262 cases (88.5%) with skin edema in different parts, 176 cases (59.5%) with abdominal pain, and 61 cases (20.6%) with upper respiratory tract edema in the throat. <b>Conclusions:</b> Hereditary angioedema is mainly characterized by episodic skin and mucosal swelling, with individualized differences in the locations and characteristics of the onset. Hereditary angioedema in children is often overlooked, and patients with a positive family history of episodic skin and mucosal swelling need to actively undergo complement level testing.","Y Xia, Z Yang, Y Wang, Y Y Huang, J Yang",2024
Implications of Family-Oriented Psychotherapy for Hereditary Angioedema Management: A Case Series.,"The role of psychotherapy in the management of chronic conditions has been widely explored and supported. The current approach to the utilization of family-oriented psychotherapy in treatment plans is individualized to the patient and focused on the development of personal coping skills alongside identifying and changing negative thoughts, emotions, and behaviors. Alleviation of symptom burden, improvement in psychiatric co-morbidities like anxiety and depression, and enhancement of quality of life have all been found to be associated with incorporating family-oriented psychotherapy in the management of chronic conditions. In contrast, heritable conditions, such as hereditary angioedema (HAE), have not been the center of extensive research. Heritable conditions introduce a new category of stressors that require management like the anxiety of a parent, a sibling, a child, or another family member decompensating at the same time as oneself. Family-centered psychotherapy focuses on discussing the stressors of the family unit and the development of coping strategies to prevent the time course of one family member's condition from exacerbating another family member's condition. This model has been utilized for families with separate chronic conditions, but its role and effectiveness in managing inherited conditions have room for investigation. This paper presents a case series on a family engaging in family-centered psychotherapy for HAE.","Abyson Kalladanthyil, Ami J Patel, Rama R Gogineni",2024
