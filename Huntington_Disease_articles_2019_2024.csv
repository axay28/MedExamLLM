Nuclear proteasomes as a backup for autophagy: interconnected proteostasis pathways.,"Protein homeostasis (proteostasis) refers to the balance of the cellular protein environment, tightly regulated by pathways governing protein synthesis, folding, trafficking, and degradation. Growing evidence supports the interconnection of these pathways to ensure the robustness of the proteo-stasis network. A recent study by Park et al. showed that, in macroautophagy/autophagy-deficient cells, the loss of proteasome or nuclear pore components causes synthetic lethality, as cytoplasmic proteins that accumulate under impaired autophagy are transported to the nucleus and degraded by nuclear proteasomes. The authors illustrated the mechanistic basis for why cells with conditions such as Huntington disease, where both autophagy and cytoplasm-to-nuclear shuttling are compromised, are more vulnerable to proteostasis perturbation.<b>Abbreviation</b>: UPR: unfolded protein response; UPS: ubiquitin-proteasome system.","Meiyan Jin, Daniel J Klionsky",2024
Cannabinoids shift the basal ganglia miRNA m6A methylation profile towards an anti-inflammatory phenotype in SIV-infected Rhesus macaques.,"Epitranscriptomic modifications modulate diverse biological processes, such as regulation of gene expression, abundance, location and function. In particular, N6-methyladenosine (m6A) methylation has been shown to regulate various disease processes, including cancer and inflammation. While there is evidence that m6A modification is functionally relevant in neural development and differentiation, the role of m6A modification in HIV neuropathogenesis is unknown. Here, we identified direct m6A modifications in miRNAs from BG tissues of Rhesus Monkeys (RMs) that were either vehicle-treated uninfected (VEH), SIV-infected combination anti-retroviral therapy (cART) treated (VEH/SIV/cART), or THC:CBD treated VEH/SIV/cART (THC:CBD/SIV/cART) RMs. We detected m6A modifications across all BG tissues. SIV infection promoted an overall hypomethylated m6A profile. While the overall hypomethylated m6A profile was not significantly impacted by THC:CBD treatment, specific miRNAs, particularly those predicted to target proinflammatory genes showed markedly reduced m6A methylation levels compared to the VEH treated RMs. Additionally, we found that specific BG tissue miRNAs bearing m6A epi-transcriptomic marks were also transferred to BG-derived extracellular vesicles (EVs). Mechanistically, we identified the DRACH motif of the seed region of miR-194-5p to be significantly m6A hypomethylated, which was predicted to directly target STAT1, an important interferon-activated transcription factor known to drive neuroinflammation, in diseases ranging from Alzheimer to Parkinson and Huntington disease. Notably, THC:CBD treatments significantly reduced m6A methylation of 43 miRNA species directly involved in regulating CNS network genes, thus providing a possible mechanist explanation on the beneficial effects of THC:CBD treatments noted in several disease involving neuroinflammation. Our findings also underscore the need for investigating the qualitative, posttranscriptional modification changes in the RNA profiles along with the more traditional, qualitative alterations in pathological conditions or after various treatment regimens.","Chioma M Okeoma, Lakmini Premadasa, Chen Sabrina Tan, Ionita Ghiran, Mahesh Mohan",2024
Glycosylation of chrysin with β-d-glucose tetraacetate (LQFM280) enhances its in vitro and in vivo neuroprotective effects against the toxicity induced by 3-nitropropionic acid.,"Chrysin (CHR) is a naturally occurring flavonoid found in the human diet, recognized for its potential in preventing neurodegenerative diseases. However, its limited water solubility restricts its bioavailability and therapeutic applications. To address this issue and bolster the neuroprotective properties of CHR for potential nutraceutical or medicinal use, we investigated a novel compound, LQFM280, formed by conjugating CHR with β-d-glucose tetraacetate. We conducted both in vitro (using SH-SY5Y cells, mutant STHdhQ111/Q111 cells, and wild-type STHdhQ7/Q7 cells), and in vivo (mice) neurotoxicity experimental model induced by 3-nitropropionic acid, which mimic biological changes akin to Huntington's disease in humans. Compared to non-glycosylated CHR, LQFM280 showed superior in vitro effects in preventing neurotoxicity caused by increased mitochondrial vulnerability due to mutant huntingtin. In vivo findings demonstrated that LQFM280 has heightened efficacy in mitigating weight loss, memory and locomotor impairment, oxidative stress, and disruptions in the antioxidant defense system, as well as succinate dehydrogenase, and cholinesterase activities induced by 3-nitropropionic acid. These findings underscore the significant enhancement of chrysin's neuroprotective effects through glycosylation with β-d-glucose tetraacetate, positioning it as a promising candidate for use as a nutraceutical or food supplement to promote health benefits.","Robbert Mota Pereira, Hericles Mesquita Campos, Pâmela Yasmin de Oliveira Ferreira, Nkaa Uchenna, Yohanny Souza Silva, Victor Ifeanyi Okoh, Letizia Pruccoli, Evilanna Lima Arruda, Luciano Morais Lião, Pedro Augusto Alves Mota, Jacqueline Alves Leite, Raphaela de Castro Georg, David Henriques da Matta, Fernanda Cristina Alcantara Dos Santos, Elson Alves Costa, Andrea Tarozzi, Ricardo Menegatti, Paulo César Ghedini",2024
Dissemination of VMAT-2 Inhibitors: A New Class Drug for Tardive Dyskinesia and Huntington Disease.,"In 2017, the FDA approved deutetrabenazine (AUSTEDO) for the treatment of tardive dyskinesia (TD) and chorea associated with Huntington disease (HD). Concurrently, valbenazine (INGREZZA) was approved specifically for TD. The adoption of new medications is influenced by various factors, including patient's medical needs, the prescriber's adoption of new practice, and external environmental factors (e.g., cost). Our analysis aims to examine the dissemination of 2 vesicular monoamine transporter 2 (VMAT-2) inhibitors, deutetrabenazine and valbenazine, in the market.","Erica Ma, Emma Krening, Michiko K Bruno",2025
Distortion errors characterise visuo-constructive performance in Huntington's disease.,"<b>Objective:</b> Visuospatial deficits have been extensively studied in Huntington's disease (HD), particularly in relation to visuomotor integration, with less emphasis on visuo-constructive abilities. Quantitative analyses have demonstrated that individuals with HD perform worse than healthy controls (HC) but similarly to people with Alzheimer's disease (AD). The aim of the present study was to conduct a qualitative investigation of visuo-constructive abilities in both HD and AD. By employing both simple and complex tasks, we hypothesized that a qualitative analysis of performance would reveal a distinct pattern of errors specific to HD. <b>Methods:</b> Participants for this study were identified retrospectively. The sample included 41 individuals with HD, 25 with AD, and 35 HC. All participants underwent a neuropsychological battery, which included the Constructional Apraxia Test (CAT) and the Rey-Osterrieth Complex Figure (ROCF) test. <b>Results:</b> Our results showed no significant quantitative difference in visuo-constructive performance between the two patient groups. However, distinct qualitative patterns of drawing errors emerged. Simplifications were more frequent in the AD group, while distortions were distinctive errors in the HD group. These qualitative error patterns were consistent across both the CAT and ROCF. <b>Conclusion:</b> Our study emphasises the value of qualitative analysis in interpreting visuo-constructive performance, shifting the focus from ""how much"" a participant achieves to ""how"" they perform a neuropsychological task. This qualitative approach is useful to capture the complexity and variability of individual performance, providing deeper insight into the cognitive processes affected by different neurological conditions.","Angelica Di Cecca, Ciro Rosario Ilardi, Flavio Della Pia, Chiara Criscuolo, Sergio Della Sala, Elena Salvatore",2024
Challenges and advances for huntingtin detection in cerebrospinal fluid: in support of relative quantification.,"Huntington disease (HD) is a progressive and devastating neurodegenerative disease caused by expansion of a glutamine-coding CAG tract in the huntingtin (<i>HTT</i>) gene above a critical threshold of ~35 repeats resulting in expression of mutant HTT (mHTT). A promising treatment approach being tested in clinical trials is HTT lowering, which aims to reduce levels of the mHTT protein. Target engagement of these therapies in the brain are inferred using antibody-based assays to measure mHTT levels in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), which is frequently reported as absolute mHTT concentration based on a monomeric protein standard used to generate a standard curve. However, patient biofluids are a complex milieu of different mHTT protein species, suggesting that absolute quantitation is challenging, and a single, recombinant protein standard may not be sufficient to interpret assay signal as molar mHTT concentration. In this study, we used immunoprecipitation and flow cytometry (IP-FCM) to investigate different factors that influence mHTT detection assay signal. Our results show that HTT protein fragmentation, protein-protein interactions, affinity tag positioning, oligomerization and polyglutamine tract length affect assay signal intensity, indicating that absolute HTT quantitation in heterogeneous biological samples is not possible with current technologies using a single standard protein. We also explore the binding specificity of the MW1 anti-polyglutamine antibody, commonly used in these assays as a mHTT-selective reagent and demonstrate that mHTT binding is preferred but not specific. Furthermore, we find that MW1 depletion is not only incomplete, leaving residual mHTT, but also non-specific, resulting in pull down of some wildtype HTT protein. Based on these observations, we recommend that mHTT detection assays report only relative mHTT quantitation using normalized arbitrary units of assay signal intensity, rather than molar concentrations, in the assessment of central nervous system HTT lowering in ongoing clinical and preclinical studies, and that MW1-depletion not be used a method for quantifying wildtype HTT protein.","Rachel J Harding, Yuanyun Xie, Nicholas S Caron, Hailey Findlay-Black, Caroline Lyu, Nalini Potluri, Renu Chandrasekaran, Michael R Hayden, Blair R Leavitt, Douglas R Langbehn, Amber L Southwell",2024

Pediatric Huntington Disease Brains Have Distinct Morphologic and Metabolic Traits: the RAREST-JHD Study.,"Pediatric-onset Huntington's disease (POHD) exhibits a phenotype different from adult-onset HD (AOHD), with hypokinetic movement disorders (eg, rigidity, bradykinesia, and dystonia) rather than chorea typical of AOHD.","Maria Eugenia Caligiuri, Emanuele Tinelli, Patrizia Vizza, Giulia Giancaterino, Francesco Cicone, Giuseppe Lucio Cascini, Umberto Sabatini, Ferdinando Squitieri",2024
Increased frequency of repeat expansion mutations across different populations.,"Repeat expansion disorders (REDs) are a devastating group of predominantly neurological diseases. Together they are common, affecting 1 in 3,000 people worldwide with population-specific differences. However, prevalence estimates of REDs are hampered by heterogeneous clinical presentation, variable geographic distributions and technological limitations leading to underascertainment. Here, leveraging whole-genome sequencing data from 82,176 individuals from different populations, we found an overall disease allele frequency of REDs of 1 in 283 individuals. Modeling disease prevalence using genetic data, age at onset and survival, we show that the expected number of people with REDs would be two to three times higher than currently reported figures, indicating underdiagnosis and/or incomplete penetrance. While some REDs are population specific, for example, Huntington disease-like 2 in Africans, most REDs are represented in all broad genetic ancestries (that is, Europeans, Africans, Americans, East Asians and South Asians), challenging the notion that some REDs are found only in specific populations. These results have worldwide implications for local and global health communities in the diagnosis and counseling of REDs.","Kristina Ibañez, Bharati Jadhav, Matteo Zanovello, Delia Gagliardi, Christopher Clarkson, Stefano Facchini, Paras Garg, Alejandro Martin-Trujillo, Scott J Gies, Valentina Galassi Deforie, Anupriya Dalmia, Davina J Hensman Moss, Jana Vandrovcova, Clarissa Rocca, Loukas Moutsianas, Chiara Marini-Bettolo, Helen Walker, Chris Turner, Maryam Shoai, Jeffrey D Long, Pietro Fratta, Douglas R Langbehn, Sarah J Tabrizi, Mark J Caulfield, Andrea Cortese, Valentina Escott-Price, John Hardy, Henry Houlden, Andrew J Sharp, Arianna Tucci",2024
The impact of expiratory muscle strength training on voluntary cough effectiveness in Huntington's disease.,"Dysfunction of the airway defence system in Huntington's disease (HD) is a significant but often overlooked problem. Although expiratory muscle strength training (EMST) is frequently utilized in cough effectiveness treatment, its specific impact in HD patients has not yet been explored. This study investigated the effects of EMST on voluntary peak cough flow (vPCF) in HD patients and evaluated the retention of potential gains post-intervention.","Romana Konvalinkova, Martin Srp, Kristyna Doleckova, Vaclav Capek, Ota Gal, Martina Hoskovcova, Radim Kliment, Jan Muzik, Evzen Ruzicka, Jiri Klempir",2024
Immunology of cell and gene therapy approaches for neurologic diseases.,"Repair and replacement strategies using cell replacement or viral gene transfer for neurologic diseases are becoming increasingly efficacious with clinically meaningful benefits in several conditions. An increased understanding of disease processes opens up opportunities for genetic therapies and precision medicine methods aiming at disease modification or repair of lesioned neurologic structures. However, such therapeutic effects may be limited or rendered ineffective by immune responses against gene products or cells used for the intended treatments. When introducing therapeutic agents into the nervous system, a set of biologic responses are inevitably triggered, which may lead to host responses that limit the intended therapeutic goals. Factors of importance include the type of vector used and origin of cells, the mode of introduction, the degree of host immunization, and any prior exposure to the agents used. It is possible to apply specific treatments that interfere with many of these steps and factors in order to limit host immunization and to reduce or eliminate host effector reactions against the therapeutic agents. This includes immune-evading design measures of the advanced therapeutic medicinal products and various immunosuppressive processes. Limited duration of specific immune modulations may be possible under carefully monitored programs.",Håkan Widner,2024
Poly ADP-ribose signaling is dysregulated in Huntington disease.,"Huntington disease (HD) is a genetic neurodegenerative disease caused by cytosine, adenine, guanine (CAG) expansion in the <i>Huntingtin</i> (<i>HTT</i>) gene, translating to an expanded polyglutamine tract in the HTT protein. Age at disease onset correlates to CAG repeat length but varies by decades between individuals with identical repeat lengths. Genome-wide association studies link HD modification to DNA repair and mitochondrial health pathways. Clinical studies show elevated DNA damage in HD, even at the premanifest stage. A major DNA repair node influencing neurodegenerative disease is the PARP pathway. Accumulation of poly adenosine diphosphate (ADP)-ribose (PAR) has been implicated in Alzheimer and Parkinson diseases, as well as cerebellar ataxia. We report that HD mutation carriers have lower cerebrospinal fluid PAR levels than healthy controls, starting at the premanifest stage. Human HD induced pluripotent stem cell-derived neurons and patient-derived fibroblasts have diminished PAR response in the context of elevated DNA damage. We have defined a PAR-binding motif in HTT, detected HTT complexed with PARylated proteins in human cells during stress, and localized HTT to mitotic chromosomes upon inhibition of PAR degradation. Direct HTT PAR binding was measured by fluorescence polarization and visualized by atomic force microscopy at the single molecule level. While wild-type and mutant HTT did not differ in their PAR binding ability, purified wild-type HTT protein increased in vitro PARP1 activity while mutant HTT did not. These results provide insight into an early molecular mechanism of HD, suggesting possible targets for the design of early preventive therapies.","Tamara Maiuri, Carlos Barba Bazan, Rachel J Harding, Nola Begeja, Tae-In Kam, Lauren M Byrne, Filipe B Rodrigues, Monica M Warner, Kaitlyn Neuman, Muqtasid Mansoor, Mohsen Badiee, Morgan Dasovich, Keona Wang, Leslie M Thompson, Anthony K L Leung, Sara N Andres, Edward J Wild, Ted M Dawson, Valina L Dawson, Cheryl H Arrowsmith, Ray Truant",2024
Integrating network pharmacology and bioinformatics to explore the mechanism of Xiaojian Zhongtang in treating major depressive disorder: An observational study.,"Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a common mental illness. The traditional Chinese medicine compound Xiaojian Zhongtang (XJZT) has a good therapeutic effect on MDD, but the specific mechanism is not clear. The aim of this study is to explore the molecular mechanism of XJZT in the treatment of MDD through network pharmacology and bioinformatics. The traditional Chinese medicine system pharmacology database was used to screen the chemical components and targets of XJZT, while the online Mendelian inheritance in man, DisGeNET, Genecards, and therapeutic target database databases were used to collect MDD targets and identify the intersection targets of XJZT and MDD. A ""drugs-components-targets"" network was constructed using the Cytoscape platform, and the STRING was used for protein-protein interaction analysis of intersecting targets. Gene Ontology and Kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes analysis of intersecting targets was performed using the DAVID database. Obtain serum and brain transcriptome datasets of MDD from the gene expression omnibus database, and perform differentially expressed genes, weighted gene co-expression network analysis, gene set enrichment analysis, and receiver operating characteristic analysis. A total of 127 chemical components and 767 targets were obtained from XJZT, among which quercetin, kaempferol, and maltose are the core chemical components, and 1728 MDD targets were screened out, with 77 intersecting targets between XJZT and MDD. These targets mainly involve AGE-RAGE signaling pathway in diabetic complexes, epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor resistance, and HIF-1 signaling pathway, and these core targets have strong binding activity with core components. In addition, 1166 differentially expressed genes were identified in the MDD serum transcriptome dataset, and weighted gene co-expression network analysis identified the most relevant gene modules (1269 genes), among which RAC-alpha serine/threonine-protein kinase (AKT1), D(4) dopamine receptor (DRD4), and kynurenine 3-monooxygenase (KMO) were target genes for the treatment of MDD with XJZT, these 3 genes are mainly related to the ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis, arachidonic acid (AA) metabolism, and Huntington disease pathways, and the expression of AKT1, DRD4, and KMO was also found in the MDD brain transcriptome dataset, which is significantly correlated with the occurrence of MDD. We have identified 3 key targets for XJZT treatment of MDD, including AKT1, KMO, and DRD4, and they can be regulated by the key components of XJZT, including quercetin, maltose, and kaempferol. This provides valuable insights for the early clinical diagnosis and development of therapeutic drugs for MDD.","Huaning Jiang, Jian Zhang, Quan Li, Yanyan Zhou",2024
The ZDHHC13/ZDHHC17 subfamily: From biological functions to therapeutic targets of diseases.,"The ZDHHC13/ZDHHC17 subfamily belongs to the zinc finger DHHC-domain containing (ZDHHC) family, including ZDHHC13 and ZDHHC17. Recent studies have shown that the ZDHHC13/ZDHHC17 subfamily is involved in various pathological and physiological processes, including S-palmitoylation, Mg<sup>2+</sup> transport, and CALCOCO1-mediated Golgiphagy. Moreover, the ZDHHC13/ZDHHC17 subfamily plays a crucial role in the occurrence and development of many diseases, including Huntington disease (HD), osteoporosis, atopic dermatitis, diabetes, and cancer. In the present review, we describe the distribution, structure, and post-translational modifications (PTMs) of the ZDHHC13/ZDHHC17 subfamily. Moreover, we effectively summarize the biological functions and associated diseases of this subfamily. Given the pleiotropy of the ZDHHC13/ZDHHC17 subfamily, it is imperative to conduct further research on its members to comprehend the pertinent pathophysiological mechanisms and to devise tactics for managing and controlling various diseases.","Ying Zhang, Sisi Fan, Lu He, Lanfang Li",2024
Advancements in surgical treatments for Huntington disease: From pallidotomy to experimental therapies.,"Huntington disease (HD) is an autosomal dominant neurodegenerative disorder characterized by choreic movements, behavioral changes, and cognitive impairment. The pathogenesis of this process is a consequence of mutant protein toxicity in striatal and cortical neurons. Thus far, neurosurgical management of HD has largely been limited to symptomatic relief of motor symptoms using ablative and stimulation techniques. These interventions, however, do not modify the progressive course of the disease. More recently, disease-modifying experimental therapeutic strategies have emerged targeting intrastriatal infusion of neurotrophic factors, cell transplantation, HTT gene silencing, and delivery of intrabodies. Herein we review therapies requiring neurosurgical intervention, including those targeting symptom management and more recent disease-modifying agents, with a focus on safety, efficacy, and surgical considerations.","Leo J Y Kim, Bornali Kundu, Paolo Moretti, Andres M Lozano, Shervin Rahimpour",2024
The interplay between probiotics and host autophagy: mechanisms of action and emerging insights.,"Autophagy, a lysosome-dependent protein degradation mechanism, is a highly conserved catabolic process seen in all eukaryotes. This cell protection system, which is present in all tissues and functions at a basic level, can be up- or downregulated in response to various stresses. A disruption in the natural route of the autophagy process is frequently followed by an interruption in the inherent operation of the body's cells and organs. Probiotics are live bacteria that protect the host through various mechanisms. One of the processes through which probiotics exert their beneficial effects on various cells and tissues is autophagy. Autophagy can assist in maintaining host homeostasis by stimulating the immune system and affecting numerous physiological and pathological responses. In this review, we particularly focus on autophagy impairments occurring in several human illnesses and investigate how probiotics affect the autophagy process under various circumstances.<b>Abbreviation</b>: AD: Alzheimer disease; AKT: AKT serine/threonine kinase; AMPK: 5'AMP-activated protein kinase; ATG: autophagy related; CCl<sub>4</sub>: carbon tetrachloride; CFS: cell-free supernatant; CMA: chaperone-mediated autophagy; CRC: colorectal cancer; EPS: <i>L.</i> <i>plantarum</i> H31 exopolysaccharide; HD: Huntington disease; HFD: high-fat diet; HPV: human papillomavirus; IFNG/IFN-γ: interferon gamma; IL6: interleukin 6; LGG: <i>L. rhamnosus</i> GG; LPS: lipopolysaccharide; MTOR: mechanistic target of rapamycin kinase; MTORC1: MTOR complex 1; NAFLD: non-alcoholic fatty liver disease; NASH: non-alcoholic steatohepatitis; PD: Parkinson disease; Pg3G: pelargonidin-3-O-glucoside; PI3K: phosphoinositide 3-kinase; PolyQ: polyglutamine; ROS: reactive oxygen species; SCFAs: short-chain fatty acids; SLAB51: a novel formulation of lactic acid bacteria and bifidobacteria; Slp: surface layer protein (of acidophilus NCFM); SNCA: synuclein alpha; ULK1: unc-51 like autophagy-activating kinase 1; YB: <i>B.</i> <i>longum</i> subsp. <i>infantis</i> YB0411; YFP: yeast fermentate prebiotic.","Zahra Sadeghloo, Ali Nabavi-Rad, Mohammad Reza Zali, Daniel J Klionsky, Abbas Yadegar",2024
General loss of proteostasis links Huntington disease to Cockayne syndrome.,"Cockayne syndrome (CS) is an autosomal recessive disorder of developmental delay, multiple organ system degeneration and signs of premature ageing. We show here, using the RNA-seq data from two CS mutant cell lines, that the CS key transcriptional signature displays significant enrichment of neurodegeneration terms, including genes relevant in Huntington disease (HD). By using deep learning approaches and two published RNA-Seq datasets, the CS transcriptional signature highly significantly classified and predicted HD and control samples. Neurodegeneration is one hallmark of CS disease, and fibroblasts from CS patients with different causative mutations display disturbed ribosomal biogenesis and a consecutive loss of protein homeostasis - proteostasis. Encouraged by the transcriptomic data, we asked whether this pathomechanism is also active in HD. In different HD cell-culture models, we showed that mutant Huntingtin impacts ribosomal biogenesis and function. This led to an error-prone protein synthesis and, as shown in different mouse models and human tissue, whole proteome instability, and a general loss of proteostasis.","Maximilian Wagner, Gaojie Zhu, Fatima Khalid, Tamara Phan, Pallab Maity, Ludmila Lupu, Eric Agyeman-Duah, Sebastian Wiese, Katrin S Lindenberg, Michael Schön, G Bernhard Landwehrmeyer, Marianna Penzo, Stefan Kochanek, Karin Scharffetter-Kochanek, Medhanie Mulaw, Sebastian Iben",2024

Dysfunctional mitochondria in age-related neurodegeneration: Utility of melatonin as an antioxidant treatment.,"Mitochondria functionally degrade as neurons age. Degenerative changes cause inefficient oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) and elevated electron leakage from the electron transport chain (ETC) promoting increased intramitochondrial generation of damaging reactive oxygen and reactive nitrogen species (ROS and RNS). The associated progressive accumulation of molecular damage causes an increasingly rapid decline in mitochondrial physiology contributing to aging. Melatonin, a multifunctional free radical scavenger and indirect antioxidant, is synthesized in the mitochondrial matrix of neurons. Melatonin reduces electron leakage from the ETC and elevates ATP production; it also detoxifies ROS/RNS and via the SIRT3/FOXO pathway it upregulates activities of superoxide dismutase 2 and glutathione peroxidase. Melatonin also influences glucose processing by neurons. In neurogenerative diseases, neurons often adopt Warburg-type metabolism which excludes pyruvate from the mitochondria causing reduced intramitochondrial acetyl coenzyme A production. Acetyl coenzyme A supports the citric acid cycle and OXPHOS. Additionally, acetyl coenzyme A is a required co-substrate for arylalkylamine-N-acetyl transferase, which rate limits melatonin synthesis; therefore, melatonin production is diminished in cells that experience Warburg-type metabolism making mitochondria more vulnerable to oxidative stress. Moreover, endogenously produced melatonin diminishes during aging, further increasing oxidative damage to mitochondrial components. More normal mitochondrial physiology is preserved in aging neurons with melatonin supplementation.","Russel J Reiter, Ramaswamy N Sharma, Walter Manucha, Sergio Rosales-Corral, Luiz Gustavo de Almieda Chuffa, Doris Loh, Francesca Luchetti, Walter Balduini, Piyarat Govitrapong",2024

Transcriptomics analysis reveals potential regulatory role of nSMase2 (Smpd3) in nervous system development and function of middle-aged mouse brains.,"Neutral sphingomyelinase-2 (nSMase2), gene name sphingomyelin phosphodiesterase-3 (Smpd3), is a key regulatory enzyme responsible for generating the sphingolipid ceramide. The function of nSMase2 in the brain is still controversial. To better understand the functional roles of nSMase2 in the aging mouse brain, we applied RNA-seq analysis, which identified a total of 1462 differentially abundant mRNAs between +/fro and fro/fro, of which 891 were increased and 571 were decreased in nSMase2-deficient mouse brains. The most strongly enriched GO and KEGG annotation terms among transcripts increased in fro/fro mice included synaptogenesis, synapse development, synaptic signaling, axon development, and axonogenesis. Among decreased transcripts, enriched annotations included ribosome assembly and mitochondrial protein complex functions. KEGG analysis of decreased transcripts also revealed overrepresentation of annotations for Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), and Huntington disease (HD). Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) tools predicted lower susceptibility to these neurodegenerative disorders, as well as predictions agreeing with stronger synaptic function, learning, and memory in fro/fro mice. The IPA tools identified signaling proteins, epigenetic regulators, and microRNAs as likely upstream regulators of the broader set of genes encoding the affected transcripts. It also revealed 16 gene networks, each linked to biological processes identified as overrepresented annotations among the affected transcripts by multiple analysis methods. Therefore, the analysis of these RNA-seq data indicates that nSMase2 impacts synaptic function and neural development, and may contribute to the onset and development of neurodegenerative diseases in middle-aged mice.","Zhihui Zhu, Timothy S McClintock, Erhard Bieberich",2024

Exon 1-targeting miRNA reduces the pathogenic exon 1 HTT protein in Huntington disease models.,"Huntington disease (HD) is a fatal neurodegenerative disease caused by a trinucleotide repeat expansion in exon 1 of the huntingtin gene (HTT) resulting in toxic gain-of-function and cell death. Despite its monogenic cause, the pathogenesis of HD is highly complex and increasing evidence indicates that, in addition to the full-length (FL) mutant HTT protein, the expanded exon 1 HTT (HTTexon1) protein that is translated from the HTT1a transcript generated by aberrant splicing is prone to aggregate and may contribute to HD pathology. This finding suggests that reducing the expression of HTT1a may achieve a greater therapeutic benefit than targeting only FL mutant HTT. Conversely, strategies that exclusively target FL HTT may not fully prevent the pathogenesis of HD. We have developed an engineered microRNA targeting the HTT exon 1 sequence (miHTT), delivered via adeno-associated virus serotype 5 (AAV5). The target sequence of miHTT is present in both FL HTT and HTT1a transcripts. Preclinical studies with AAV5-miHTT have demonstrated efficacy in several rodent and large animal models by reducing FL HTT mRNA and protein and rescuing HD-like phenotypes, and have been the rationale for phase I/II clinical studies now ongoing in the US and Europe. In the present study, we evaluated the ability of AAV5-miHTT to reduce the levels of aberrantly spliced HTT1a mRNA and the HTTexon1 protein in the brain of two mouse models of HD (heterozygous zQ175 knock-in mice and humanized Hu128/21 mice). Polyadenylated HTT1a mRNA and HTTexon1 protein were detected in the striatum and cortex of heterozygous zQ175 knock-in mice, but not in wild-type, littermate control mice. Intrastriatal administration of AAV5-miHTT resulted in dose-dependent expression of mature miHTT microRNA in cortical brain regions, accompanied by significant lowering of both FL HTT and HTT1a mRNA expression at two months post-injection. Mutant HTT and HTTexon1 protein levels were also significantly reduced in the striatum and cortex of heterozygous zQ175 knock-in at 2 months after AAV5-miHTT treatment and in humanized Hu128/21 mice 7 months post-treatment. The effects were confirmed in primary Hu128/21 neuronal cultures. These results demonstrate that AAV5-miHTT gene therapy is an effective approach to lower both FL HTT and the pathogenic HTTexon1 levels, which could potentially have an additive therapeutic benefit compared to other HTT-targeting modalities.","Marina Sogorb-Gonzalez, Christian Landles, Nicholas S Caron, Anouk Stam, Georgina Osborne, Michael R Hayden, David Howland, Sander van Deventer, Gillian P Bates, Astrid Vallès, Melvin Evers",2024

The frequency and clinical impact of synonymous HTT loss-of-interruption and duplication-of-interruption variants in a diverse HD cohort.,To determine the frequency and clinical impact of loss-of-interruption (LOI) and duplication-of-interruption modifier variants of the HTT CAG and CCG repeat in a cohort of individuals with Huntington disease (HD).,"Jessica Dawson, Chris Kay, Hailey Findlay Black, Stephanie Bortnick, Kyla Javier, Qingwen Xia, Akshdeep Sandhu, Christina Buchanan, Virginia Hogg, Florence C F Chang, Jun Goto, Larissa Arning, Carsten Saft, Emilia K Bijlsma, Huu P Nguyen, Richard Roxburgh, Michael R Hayden",2024
Evidence-based review on symptomatic management of Huntington's disease.,"Huntington's disease (HD) is a neurodegenerative disorder with a significant impact on patients' quality of life, characterized by motor, behavioral, and cognitive impairments. This evidence-based review, conducted by the Korean Huntington Disease Society (KHDS) task force, systematically examines current pharmacological and non-pharmacological interventions for symptomatic management of HD. Following PRISMA guidelines, databases were searched for studies up to August 2022, focusing on 23 symptoms across four domains: motor, neuropsychological, cognition, and others. This review provides a comprehensive and systematic approach to the management of HD, highlighting the need for more high-quality clinical trials to develop robust evidence-based guidelines.","Jung Hwan Shin, Hui-Jun Yang, Jong Hyun Ahn, Sungyang Jo, Seok Jong Chung, Jee-Young Lee, Hyun Sook Kim, Manho Kim",2024
Huntingtin lowering impairs the maturation and synchronized synaptic activity of human cortical neuronal networks derived from induced pluripotent stem cells.,"Despite growing descriptions of wild-type Huntingtin (wt-HTT) roles in both adult brain function and, more recently, development, several clinical trials are exploring HTT-lowering approaches that target both wt-HTT and the mutant isoform (mut-HTT) responsible for Huntington's disease (HD). This non-selective targeting is based on the autosomal dominant inheritance of HD, supporting the idea that mut-HTT exerts its harmful effects through a toxic gain-of-function or a dominant-negative mechanism. However, the precise amount of wt-HTT needed for healthy neurons in adults and during development remains unclear. In this study, we address this question by examining how wt-HTT loss affects human neuronal network formation, synaptic maturation, and homeostasis in vitro. Our findings establish a role of wt-HTT in the maturation of dendritic arborization and the acquisition of network-wide synchronized activity by human cortical neuronal networks modeled in vitro. Interestingly, the network synchronization defects only became apparent when more than two-thirds of the wt-HTT protein was depleted. Our study underscores the critical need to precisely understand wt-HTT role in neuronal health. It also emphasizes the potential risks of excessive wt-HTT loss associated with non-selective therapeutic approaches targeting both wt- and mut-HTT isoforms in HD patients.","Mathilde Louçã, Donya El Akrouti, Aude Lemesle, Morgane Louessard, Noëlle Dufour, Chloé Baroin, Aurore de la Fouchardière, Laurent Cotter, Hélène Jean-Jacques, Virginie Redeker, Anselme L Perrier",2024
