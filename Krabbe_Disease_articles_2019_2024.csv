Childhood-inherited white matter disorders with calcification.,"Intracranial calcification (ICC) occurs in many neurologic disorders both acquired and genetic. In some inherited white matter disorders, it is a common or even invariable feature where the presence and pattern of calcification provides an important pointer to the specific diagnosis. This is particularly the case for the Aicardi-Goutières syndrome (AGS) and for Coats plus (CP) and leukoencephalopathy with calcifications and cysts (LCC), which are discussed in detail in this chapter. AGS is a genetic disorder of type 1 interferon regulation, caused by mutations in any of the nine genes identified to date. In its classic form, AGS has very characteristic clinical and neuroimaging features which will be discussed here. LCC is a purely neurologic disorder caused by mutations in the SNORD118 gene, whereas CP is a multisystem disorder of telomere function that may result from mutations in the CTC1, POT1, or STN genes. In spite of the different pathogenetic basis for LCC and CP, they share remarkably similar neuroimaging and neuropathologic features. Cockayne syndrome, in which ICC is usually present, is discussed elsewhere in this volume. ICC may occur as an occasional feature of many other white matter diseases, including Alexander disease, Krabbe disease, X-ALD, and occulodentodigital dysplasia.",John H Livingston,2024
Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation in leukodystrophies.,"More than 50 leukodystrophies have been described. This group of inherited disorders affects myelin development and/or maintenance and can manifest from birth to adulthood. Neuroinflammation is a hallmark of some leukodystrophies, explaining in part the therapeutic benefit of hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). Indeed, in addition to supplying the CNS with myelomonocyte donor cells expressing the deficient protein or enzyme, HSCT allows the restoration of normal microglia function, which may act on neuroinflammation. In this chapter, we explore the rationale, indication, and outcome of HSCT in Cerebral Adrenoleukodystrophy (CALD), Metachromatic Leukodystrophy (MLD), Krabbe Disease (KD), and Adult-onset Leukoencephalopathy with Axonal Spheroids and Pigmented Glia (ALSP), which are among the most frequent leukodystrophies. For these leukodystrophies, HSCT may modify notably the natural history and improve CNS-related deficits, provided that the procedure is performed early into the disease course. In addition, we discuss the recent development of ex vivo gene therapy for CALD and MLD as a promising alternative to allograft.","Caroline Sevin, Fanny Mochel",2024
Lysosomal storage diseases.,"Lysosomal storage disorders (LSDs) are a group of inherited metabolic diseases caused by dysfunction of the lysosomal system, with subsequent progressive accumulation of macromolecules, activation of inflammatory response, and cell death. Neurologic damage is almost always present, and it is usually degenerative. White matter (WM) involvement may be primary or secondary. Diseases with primary WM involvement are leukodystrophies, demyelinating (Krabbe disease and metachromatic leukodystrophy), and hypomyelinating leukodystrophies (free sialic acid storage disease, fucosidosis, and mucolipidosis type IV). LSDs with secondary WM involvement are classified as leukoencephalopathies and include gangliosidosis, mucopolysaccharidosis (MPS), ceroid neuronal lipofuscinosis, multiple sulfatase deficiency, alpha-mannosidosis, Pompe disease, and Fabry disease. Neurologic manifestations may overlap among LSDs and include developmental delays, motor, cognitive and speech impairments, seizures, visual failure, ataxia, and extrapyramidal signs. Most of LSDs are typically present in early or late infancy, but juvenile and adult forms also exist and are associated with predominantly neuropsychiatric and behavioral symptoms. The outcome of these disorders is generally poor and specific treatments (enzyme replacement therapy, hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, or gene therapy) are only available in a small number of them.","Alessandro P Burlina, Renzo Manara, Daniela Gueraldi",2024
Overview of Neuro-Ophthalmic Findings in Leukodystrophies.,"<b>Background:</b> Leukodystrophies are a group of rare genetic diseases that primarily affect the white matter of the central nervous system. The broad spectrum of metabolic and pathological causes leads to manifestations at any age, most often in childhood and adolescence, and a variety of symptoms. Leukodystrophies are usually progressive, resulting in severe disabilities and premature death. Progressive visual impairment is a common symptom. Currently, no overview of the manifold neuro-ophthalmologic manifestations and visual impact of leukodystrophies exists. <b>Methods:</b> Data from 217 patients in the Hamburg leukodystrophy cohort were analyzed retrospectively for neuro-ophthalmologic manifestations, age of disease onset, and magnetic resonance imaging, visual evoked potential, and optical coherence tomography findings and were compared with data from the literature. <b>Results:</b> In total, 68% of the patients suffered from neuro-ophthalmologic symptoms, such as optic atrophy, visual neglect, strabismus, and nystagmus. Depending on the type of leukodystrophy, neuro-ophthalmologic symptoms occurred early or late during the course of the disease. Magnetic resonance imaging scans revealed pathologic alterations in the visual tract that were temporally correlated with symptoms. <b>Conclusions:</b> The first optical coherence tomography findings in Krabbe disease and metachromatic leukodystrophy allow retinal assessments. Comprehensive literature research supports the results of this first overview of neuro-ophthalmologic findings in leukodystrophies.","Charlotte Maria Bettinger, Simon Dulz, Yevgeniya Atiskova, Helena Guerreiro, Gerhard Schön, Philipp Guder, Sarah Lena Maier, Jonas Denecke, Annette E Bley",2024
Exploring the globoid cell leukodystrophy protein network and therapeutic interventions.,"Globoid cell leukodystrophy is a severe rare disorder characterized by white matter degradation, resulting in a progressive loss of physical and mental abilities and has extremely limited therapeutic interventions. Therefore, this study aimed to delve into the Globoid cell leukodystrophy associated intricate network of differentially expressed genes (p < 0.05, |Fc|> 1) to identify potential druggable targets and possible therapeutic interventions using small molecules. The disease-associated neuronal protein circuit was constructed and analyzed, identifying 53 nodes (minimum edge cutoff 1), among which five (FOS, FOSB, GDNF, GFRA1, and JUN) were discerned as potential core protein nodes. Although our research enumerates the potential small molecules to target various protein nodes in the proposed disease network, we particularly underscore T-5224 to inhibit c-Jun activity as JUN was identified as one of the pivotal elements within the disease-associated neuronal protein circuit. The evaluation of T-5224 binding energy (- 11.0 kcal/mol) from docking study revealed that the compound to exhibit a notable affinity towards Jun/CRE complex. Moreover, the structural integrity of complex was affirmed through comprehensive molecular dynamics simulations, indicating a stable hydrophilic interaction between T-5224 and the Jun/CRE complex, thereby enhancing protein compactness and reducing solvent accessibility. This binding energy was further substantiated by free binding analysis, revealing a substantial thermodynamics complex state (- 448.00 ± 41.73 kJ/mol). Given that this investigation is confined to a computational framework, we additionally propose a hypothetical framework to ascertain the feasibility of inhibiting the Jun/CRE complex with T-5224 against Globoid cell leukodystrophy, employing a combination of in vitro and in vivo methodologies as a prospective avenue of this study.","Pukar Khanal, Vishal S Patil, Kunal Bhattacharya, Amit Kumar Shrivastava, Vishwambhar V Bhandare",2024
Human iPSC-derived myelinating organoids and globoid cells to study Krabbe Disease.,"Krabbe disease (Kd) is a lysosomal storage disorder (LSD) caused by the deficiency of the lysosomal galactosylceramidase (GALC) which cleaves the myelin enriched lipid galactosylceramide (GalCer). Accumulated GalCer is catabolized into the cytotoxic lipid psychosine that causes myelinating cells death and demyelination which recruits microglia/macrophages that fail to digest myelin debris and become globoid cells. Here, to understand the pathological mechanisms of Kd, we used induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) from Kd patients to produce myelinating organoids and microglia. We show that Kd organoids have no obvious defects in neurogenesis, astrogenesis, and oligodendrogenesis but manifest early myelination defects. Specifically, Kd organoids showed shorter but a similar number of myelin internodes than Controls at the peak of myelination and a reduced number and shorter internodes at a later time point. Interestingly, myelin is affected in the absence of autophagy and mTOR pathway dysregulation, suggesting lack of lysosomal dysfunction which makes this organoid model a very valuable tool to study the early events that drive demyelination in Kd. Kd iPSC-derived microglia show a marginal rate of globoid cell formation under normal culture conditions that is drastically increased upon GalCer feeding. Under normal culture conditions, Kd microglia show a minor LAMP1 content decrease and a slight increase in the autophagy protein LC3B. Upon GalCer feeding, Kd cells show accumulation of autophagy proteins and strong LAMP1 reduction that at a later time point are reverted showing the compensatory capabilities of globoid cells. Altogether, this supports the value of our cultures as tools to study the mechanisms that drive globoid cell formation and the compensatory mechanism in play to overcome GalCer accumulation in Kd.","Lisa Marie P Evans, Joseph Gawron, Fraser J Sim, M Laura Feltri, Leandro N Marziali",2024
Dietary Supplementation with n-3 Polyunsaturated Fatty Acids Delays the Phenotypic Manifestation of Krabbe Disease and Partially Restores Lipid Mediator Production in the Brain-Study in a Mouse Model of the Disease.,"Lipid mediators from fatty acid oxidation have been shown to be associated with the severity of Krabbe disease (KD), a disorder linked to mutations in the galactosylceramidase (<i>GALC</i>) gene. This study aims to investigate the effects of n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) supplementation on KD traits and fatty acid metabolism using Twitcher (Tw) animals as a natural model for KD. Wild-type (Wt), heterozygous (Ht), and affected Tw animals were treated orally with 36 mg n-3 PUFAs/kg body weight/day from 10 to 35 days of life. The end product of PUFA peroxidation (8-isoprostane), the lipid mediator involved in the resolution of inflammatory exudates (resolvin D1), and the total amount of n-3 PUFAs were analyzed in the brains of mice. In Tw mice, supplementation with n-3 PUFAs delayed the manifestation of disease symptoms (<i>p</i> < 0.0001), and in the bran, decreased 8-isoprostane amounts (<i>p</i> < 0.0001), increased resolvin D1 levels (<i>p</i> < 0.005) and increased quantity of total n-3 PUFAs (<i>p</i> < 0.05). Furthermore, total brain n-3 PUFA levels were associated with disease severity (r = -0.562, <i>p</i> = 0.0001), resolvin D1 (r = 0.712, <i>p</i> < 0.0001), and 8-isoprostane brain levels (r = -0.690, <i>p</i> < 0.0001). For the first time in a natural model of KD, brain levels of n-3 PUFAs are shown to determine disease severity and to be involved in the peroxidation of brain PUFAs as well as in the production of pro-resolving lipid mediators. It is also shown that dietary supplementation with n-3 PUFAs leads to a slowing of the phenotypic presentation of the disease and restoration of lipid mediator production.","Cinzia Signorini, Giovanna Pannuzzo, Adriana Carol Eleonora Graziano, Elena Moretti, Giulia Collodel, Venera Cardile",2024
Triggered saccadic oscillations: case series and review of the literature.,"Saccadic oscillations (SOs) mostly occur spontaneously, but can be occasionally triggered by various stimuli. To determine clinical characteristics and underlying mechanisms of triggered SOs, we analyzed the clinical features and quantitative eye-movement recordings of six new patients and 10 patients in the literature who exhibited with triggered SOs. Eleven of the 16 patients (69%) had a lesion involving cerebellum and/or brainstem such as cerebellar degeneration, cerebellitis, or cerebellar infarction. The other causes were vestibular migraine (n = 2), multiple sclerosis (n = 1), Krabbe disease (n = 1), and idiopathic (n = 1). Vestibular stimulation was the most common trigger (n = 11, 69%), followed by removal of visual fixation (n = 4, 25%), hyperventilation (n = 1), light (n = 1), and blink (n = 1). The types of triggered SOs were varied which included ocular flutter (n = 13), opsoclonus (n = 3), vertical SOs (n = 2), and macrosaccadic oscillations (n = 1). Three patients exhibited downbeat nystagmus either before (n = 1) or after (n = 2) the onset of SOs. The frequency of triggered SOs ranged from 4 to 15 Hz, and oscillations with smaller amplitudes had higher frequencies and smaller peak velocities. SOs can be triggered by the modulation of unstable saccadic neural networks through vestibular and visual inputs in lesions of the brainstem and cerebellum.","Eun Hye Oh, Jae-Hwan Choi, Sang Jun Park, Hyun Sung Kim, Seo Young Choi, Kwang-Dong Choi",2024
Late-onset Krabbe disease presenting as spastic paraplegia - implications of GCase and CTSB/D.,"Krabbe disease (KD) is a multisystem neurodegenerative disorder with severe disability and premature death, mostly with an infancy/childhood onset. In rare cases of late-onset phenotypes, symptoms are often milder and difficult to diagnose. We here present a translational approach combining diagnostic and biochemical analyses of a male patient with a progressive gait disorder starting at the age of 44 years, with a final diagnosis of late-onset KD (LOKD).","Rebecca Mächtel, Jan-Philipp Dobert, Ute Hehr, Alexander Weiss, Matthias Kettwig, Lucia Laugwitz, Samuel Groeschel, Manuel Schmidt, Philipp Arnold, Martin Regensburger, Friederike Zunke",2024
Promyelinating drugs ameliorate oligodendrocyte pathologies in a mouse model of Krabbe disease.,"Krabbe disease (KD) is a rare inherited demyelinating disorder caused by a deficiency in the lysosomal enzyme galactosylceramide (GalCer) β-galactosidase. Most patients with KD exhibit fatal cerebral demyelination with apoptotic oligodendrocyte (OL) death and die before the age of 2-4 years. We have previously reported that primary OLs isolated from the brains of twitcher (twi) mice, an authentic mouse model of KD, have cell-autonomous developmental defects and undergo apoptotic death accompanied by abnormal accumulation of psychosine, an endogenous cytotoxic lyso-derivative of GalCer. In this study, we aimed to investigate the effects of the preclinical promyelinating drugs clemastine and Sob-AM2 on KD OL pathologies using primary OLs isolated from the brains of twi mice. Both agents specifically prevented the apoptotic death observed in twi OLs. However, while Sob-AM2 showed higher efficacy in restoring the impaired differentiation and maturation of twi OLs, clemastine more potently reduced the endogenous psychosine levels. These results present the first preclinical in vitro data, suggesting that clemastine and Sob-AM2 can act directly and distinctly on OLs in KD and ameliorate their cellular pathologies associated with myelin degeneration.","Naoko Inamura, Taeko Kawai, Takashi Watanabe, Hiromasa Aoki, Mineyoshi Aoyama, Atsuo Nakayama, Junko Matsuda, Yasushi Enokido",2024
Splicing mutations of GALC in adult patient with adult-onset Krabbe disease: case report and review of literature.,"Krabbe disease (KD) is classed as the lysosomal storage disease with mutations in the galactosylceramidase (<i>GALC</i>) gene, and commonly showed as autosomal recessive pattern with 30-kb deletion in infantile subtype. In this case, we report a 39-years adult-onset KD (AOKD) patient with multiple sclerosis-like symptoms and neuroimaging changes. She carries the heterozygous mutations in <i>GALC</i> included a missense mutation of <i>c.1901T>C</i> from her mother, and a splicing mutation of <i>c.908+5G>A</i> from her father. The splicing mutations in KD are reviewed and confirmed that <i>c.908+5G>A</i> is a novel splicing mutation in AOKD.","Yilin Su, Lijian Wei, Lan Wang, Pingyi Xu, Mingshu Mo",2024
Newborn Screening for 6 Lysosomal Storage Disorders in China.,"Newborn screening (NBS) for lysosomal storage disorders (LSDs) is becoming an increasing concern in public health. However, the birth prevalence of these disorders is rarely reported in the Chinese population, and subclinical forms of diseases among patients identified by NBS have not been evaluated.","Siyu Chang, Xia Zhan, Yuchao Liu, Huanlei Song, Zizhen Gong, Lianshu Han, Gustavo H B Maegawa, Xuefan Gu, Huiwen Zhang",2024
Perinatal loss of galactosylceramidase in both oligodendrocytes and microglia is crucial for the pathogenesis of Krabbe disease in mice.,"Lysosomal galactosylceramidase (GALC) is expressed in all brain cells, including oligodendrocytes (OLs), microglia, and astrocytes, although the cell-specific function of GALC is largely unknown. Mutations in GALC cause Krabbe disease (KD), a fatal neurological lysosomal disorder that usually affects infants. To study how Galc ablation in each glial cell type contributes to Krabbe pathogenesis, we used conditional Galc-floxed mice. Here, we found that OL-specific Galc conditional knockout (CKO) in mice results in a phenotype that includes wasting, psychosine accumulation, and neuroinflammation. Microglia- or astrocyte-specific Galc deletion alone in mice did not show specific phenotypes. Interestingly, mice with CKO of Galc from both OLs and microglia have a more severe neuroinflammation with an increase in globoid cell accumulation than OL-specific CKO alone. Moreover, the enhanced phenotype occurred without additional accumulation of psychosine. Further studies revealed that Galc knockout (Galc-KO) microglia cocultured with Galc-KO OLs elicits globoid cell formation and the overexpression of osteopontin and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1, both proteins that are known to recruit immune cells and promote engulfment of debris and damaged cells. We conclude that OLs are the primary cells that initiate KD with an elevated psychosine level and microglia are required for the progression of neuroinflammation in a psychosine-independent manner.","Jacob Favret, Mohammed Haseeb Nawaz, Mayuri Patel, Hamid Khaledi, Michael Gelb, Daesung Shin",2024
Dual rare genetic diseases in five pediatric patients: insights from next-generation diagnostic methods.,"Clinicians traditionally aim to identify a singular explanation for the clinical presentation of a patient; however, in some cases, the diagnosis may remain elusive or fail to comprehensively explain the clinical findings. In recent years, advancements in next-generation sequencing, including whole-exome sequencing, have led to the incidental identification of dual diagnoses in patients. Herein we present the cases of five pediatric patients diagnosed with dual rare genetic diseases. Their natural history and diagnostic process were explored, and lessons learned from utilizing next-generation diagnostic technologies have been reported.","Yupeng Liu, Xue Ma, Zhehui Chen, Ruxuan He, Yao Zhang, Hui Dong, Yanyan Ma, Tongfei Wu, Qiao Wang, Yuan Ding, Xiyuan Li, Dongxiao Li, Jinqing Song, Mengqiu Li, Ying Jin, Jiong Qin, Yanling Yang",2024
Impact of an irreversible β-galactosylceramidase inhibitor on the lipid profile of zebrafish embryos.,"Krabbe disease is a sphingolipidosis characterized by the genetic deficiency of the acid hydrolase β-galactosylceramidase (GALC). Most of the studies concerning the biological role of GALC performed on Krabbe patients and <i>Galc</i>-deficient <i>twitcher</i> mice (an authentic animal model of the disease) indicate that the pathogenesis of this disorder is the consequence of the accumulation of the neurotoxic GALC substrate β-galactosylsphingosine (psychosine), ignoring the possibility that this enzyme may exert a wider biological impact. Indeed, limited information is available about the effect of GALC downregulation on the cell lipidome in adult and developing organisms. The teleost zebrafish (<i>Danio rerio</i>) has emerged as a useful platform to model human genetic diseases, including sphingolipidoses, and two <i>GALC</i> co-orthologs have been identified in zebrafish (<i>galca</i> and <i>galcb</i>). Here, we investigated the effect of the competitive and irreversible GALC inhibitor β-galactose-cyclophellitol (GCP) on the lipid profile of zebrafish embryos. Molecular modelling indicates that GCP can be sequestered in the catalytic site of the enzyme and covalently binds human GALC, and the zebrafish Galca and Galcb proteins in a similar manner. Accordingly, GCP inhibits the β-galactosylceramide hydrolase activity of zebrafish <i>in vitro</i> and <i>in vivo</i>, leading to significant alterations of the lipidome of zebrafish embryos. These results indicate that the lack of GALC activity deeply affects the lipidome during the early stages of embryonic development, and thereby provide insights into the pathogenesis of Krabbe disease.","Jessica Guerra, Mirella Belleri, Giulia Paiardi, Chiara Tobia, Davide Capoferri, Marzia Corli, Elisa Scalvini, Marco Ghirimoldi, Marcello Manfredi, Rebecca C Wade, Marco Presta, Luca Mignani",2024
The Effect of Donepezil Hydrochloride in the Twitcher Mouse Model of Krabbe Disease.,"Krabbe disease (KD) is a rare demyelinating disorder characterized by demyelination caused by mutations in the GALC gene, resulting in toxic accumulation of psychosine. Psychosine has been identified as detrimental to oligodendrocytes, leading to demyelination through diverse hypothesized pathways. Reducing demyelination is essential to maintain neurological function in KD; however, therapeutic interventions are currently limited. Acetylcholinesterase inhibitors (AChEi) are commonly used for symptomatic management of Alzheimer's Disease and are suggested to have potential disease-modifying effects, including regulating myelin state. In particular, donepezil, an AChEi, has demonstrated promising effects in cellular and animal models, including promotion of the expression of myelin-related genes and reduction of glial cell reactivity. This drug also acts as an agonist for sigma-1 receptors (Sig-1R), which are implicated in demyelination diseases. In the context of drug repurposing, here, we demonstrate that administration of donepezil has protective effects in the twitcher mouse model of KD. We provide data showing that donepezil preserves myelin and reduces glial cell reactivity in the brains of twitcher mice. Moreover, donepezil also improves behavioral phenotypes and increases lifespan in twitcher animals. These findings suggest that donepezil, with its dual activity as an AChE inhibitor and Sig-1R agonist, may hold promise as a therapeutic candidate for demyelinating diseases, including KD.","Paraskevi Papakyriakopoulou, Georgia Valsami, Kumlesh K Dev",2024
Genetic and Functional Analyses of Patients with Marked Hypo-High-Density Lipoprotein Cholesterolemia.,This study aimed to analyze two cases of marked hypo-high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterolemia to identify mutations in ATP-binding cassette transporter A1 (ABCA1) and elucidate the molecular mechanism by which these novel pathological mutations contribute to hypo-HDL cholesterolemia in Tangier disease.,"Yasuhisa Furuta, Yoshinori Osaki, Yoshimi Nakagawa, Song-Iee Han, Masaya Araki, Akito Shikama, Nami Ohuchi, Daichi Yamazaki, Erika Matsuda, Seitaro Nohara, Yuhei Mizunoe, Kenta Kainoh, Yasuhito Suehara, Hiroshi Ohno, Yoshinori Takeuchi, Takafumi Miyamoto, Yuki Murayama, Yoko Sugano, Hitoshi Iwasaki, Ken-Ichi Hirano, Masahiro Koseki, Shogo Nakano, Hiroaki Tokiwa, Motohiro Sekiya, Naoya Yahagi, Takashi Matsuzaka, Kiyotaka Nakamagoe, Yasushi Tomidokoro, Jun Mitsui, Shoji Tsuji, Hiroaki Suzuki, Hitoshi Shimano",2024

"Clinical feature, GALC variant spectrum, and genotype-phenotype correlation in Korean Krabbe disease patients: Multicenter experience over 13 years.","Krabbe disease (KD) is an autosomal recessive neurodegenerative disorder caused by deficiency of the galactocerebrosidase (GALC) due to variants in the GALC gene. Here, we provide the first and the largest comprehensive analysis of clinical and genetic characteristics, and genotype-phenotype correlations of KD in Korean in comparison with other ethnic groups. From June 2010 to June 2023, 10 patients were diagnosed with KD through sequencing of GALC. Clinical features, and results of GALC sequencing, biochemical test, neuroimaging, and neurophysiologic test were obtained from medical records. An additional nine previously reported Korean KD patients were included for review. In Korean KD patients, the median age of onset was 2 years (3 months-34 years) and the most common phenotype was adult-onset (33%, 6/18) KD, followed by infantile KD (28%, 5/18). The most frequent variants were c.683_694delinsCTC (23%) and c.1901T>C (23%), while the 30-kb deletion was absent. Having two heterozygous pathogenic missense variants was associated with later-onset phenotype. Clinical features were similar to those of other ethnic groups. In Korean KD patients, the most common phenotype was the adult-onset type and the GALC variant spectrum was different from that of the Caucasian population. This study would further our understanding of KD.","Narae Hwang, Sang-Mi Kim, Young-Gon Kim, Changhee Ha, Jeehun Lee, Byung-Ok Choi, Won Jae Sung, Seung Hyun Kim, Young Mi Kim, Yong-Wha Lee, Jieun Kim, Jong-Won Kim, Ja-Hyun Jang, Jiwon Lee, Hyung-Doo Park",2024
Lysosomal storage disorders identified in adult population from India: Experience of a tertiary genetic centre and review of literature.,"Lysosomal storage disorders (LSDs) in adults have milder phenotype and variable age at presentation. Several studies have described the phenotype, genotype and treatment outcomes for adult-onset LSDs like Gaucher, Fabry, Pompe disease and others. We describe the first systematic study on the occurrence of LSDs in an adult population from India. It describes, the key clinical signs seen in these patients and those from literature review that can aid in early detection. Of 2102 biochemically diagnosed LSDs cases, 32 adult patients were identified with LSDs. Based on the clinical suspicion, screening test and enzyme study was carried out. Twenty-two patients were subjected to a genetic study to identify the causative variant in a respective gene. Of the 32 adult patients, we observed a maximum percentage of 37.5% (<i>n</i> = 12) cases with Gaucher disease, followed by 13% (<i>n</i> = 4) with Fabry disease. We found 10% of cases with MPS IVA and MPS I, and 9% cases with Pompe. Single case of adult mucolipidosis III and two cases each of Type 1 Sialidosis, Niemann-Pick disease B and metachromatic leukodystrophy were identified. We observed two common variants p.Leu483Pro and p.Ala487Thr in the <i>GBA1</i> gene in 23% of Indian patients with adult Gaucher disease. No common variants were observed in other aforementioned LSDs. Study identified 50% of Fabry patients and 4% of Gaucher patients diagnosed at our centre to be adults. The prevalence of adult Pompe patients was low (3.4%) as compared to 80% reported in the Caucasian population.

From pathological mechanisms in Krabbe disease to cutting-edge therapy: A comprehensive review.,"Since its initial documentation by Knud Krabbe in 1916, numerous studies have scrutinized the characteristics of Krabbe disease (KD) until the identification of the mutation in the GALC gene. In alignment with that, we investigated the natural history of KD spanning eight decades to gain a deeper understanding of the evolutionary trajectory of its mechanisms. Through our comprehensive analysis, we unearthed additional novel elements in molecular biology involving the micropathological mechanism of the disease. This review offers an updated perspective on the metabolic disorder that defines KD. Recently, extracellular vesicles (EVs), autophagy impairment, and α-synuclein have emerged as pivotal players in the neuropathological processes. EVs might serve as a cellular mechanism to avoid or alleviate the detrimental impacts of excessive toxic psychosine levels, and extracting EVs could contribute to synapse dysfunction. Autophagy impairment was found to be independent of psychosine and reliant on AKT and B-cell lymphoma 2. Additionally, α-synuclein has been recognized for inducing cellular death and dysfunction in common biological pathways. Our objective is to assess the effectiveness of advanced therapies in addressing this particular condition. While hematopoietic stem cells have been a primary treatment, its administration proves challenging, particularly in the presymptomatic phase. In this review, we have compiled information from over 10 therapy trials, comparing them based on their benefits and disadvantage.","Imen Ketata, Emna Ellouz",2024
Chronic Rapamycin administration via drinking water mitigates the pathological phenotype in a Krabbe disease mouse model through autophagy activation.,"Krabbe disease (KD) is a rare disorder arising from the deficiency of the lysosomal enzyme galactosylceramidase (GALC), leading to the accumulation of the cytotoxic metabolite psychosine (PSY) in the nervous system. This accumulation triggers demyelination and neurodegeneration, and despite ongoing research, the underlying pathogenic mechanisms remain incompletely understood, with no cure currently available. Previous studies from our lab revealed the involvement of autophagy dysfunctions in KD pathogenesis, showcasing p62-tagged protein aggregates in the brains of KD mice and heightened p62 levels in the KD sciatic nerve. We also demonstrated that the autophagy inducer Rapamycin (RAPA) can partially reinstate the wild type (WT) phenotype in KD primary cells by decreasing the number of p62 aggregates. In this study, we tested RAPA in the Twitcher (TWI) mouse, a spontaneous KD mouse model. We administered the drug ad libitum via drinking water (15 mg/L) starting from post-natal day (PND) 21-23. We longitudinally monitored the mouse motor performance through grip strength and rotarod tests, and a set of biochemical parameters related to the KD pathogenesis (i.e. autophagy markers expression, PSY accumulation, astrogliosis and myelination). Our findings demonstrate that RAPA significantly enhances motor functions at specific treatment time points and reduces astrogliosis in TWI brain, spinal cord, and sciatic nerves. Utilizing western blot and immunohistochemistry, we observed a decrease in p62 aggregates in TWI nervous tissues, corroborating our earlier in-vitro results. Moreover, RAPA treatment partially removes PSY in the spinal cord. In conclusion, our results advocate for considering RAPA as a supportive therapy for KD. Notably, as RAPA is already available in pharmaceutical formulations for clinical use, its potential for KD treatment can be rapidly evaluated in clinical trials.","Ambra Del Grosso, Sara Carpi, Miriam De Sarlo, Luca Scaccini, Laura Colagiorgio, Husam B R Alabed, Lucia Angella, Roberto Maria Pellegrino, Ilaria Tonazzini, Carla Emiliani, Marco Cecchini",2024
Newborn Screening for Krabbe Disease: Status Quo and Recommendations for Improvements.,"Krabbe disease (KD) is part of newborn screening (NBS) in 11 states with at least one additional state preparing to screen. In July 2021, KD was re-nominated for addition to the federal Recommended Uniform Screening Panel (RUSP) in the USA with a two-tiered strategy based on psychosine (PSY) as the determinant if an NBS result is positive or negative after a first-tier test revealed decreased galactocerebrosidase activity. Nine states currently screening for KD include PSY analysis in their screening strategy. However, the nomination was rejected in February 2023 because of perceived concerns about a high false positive rate, potential harm to newborns with an uncertain prognosis, and inadequate data on presymptomatic treatment benefit or harm. To address the concern about false positive NBS results, a survey was conducted of the eight NBS programs that use PSY and have been screening for KD for at least 1 year. Seven of eight states responded. We found that: (1) the use of PSY is variable; (2) when modeling the data based on the recommended screening strategy for KD, and applying different cutoffs for PSY, each state could virtually eliminate false positive results without major impact on sensitivity; (3) the reason for the diverse strategies appears to be primarily the difficulty of state programs to adjust screening algorithms due to the concern of possibly missing even an adult-onset case following a change that focuses on infantile and early infantile KD. Contracts with outside vendors and the effort/cost of making changes to a program's information systems can be additional obstacles. We recommend that programs review their historical NBS outcomes for KD with their advisory committees and make transparent decisions on whether to accept false positive results for such a devastating condition or to adjust their procedures to ensure an efficient, effective, and manageable NBS program for KD.","Dietrich Matern, Khaja Basheeruddin, Tracy L Klug, Gwendolyn McKee, Patricia U Edge, Patricia L Hall, Joanne Kurtzberg, Joseph J Orsini",2024

Progress in leukodystrophies with zebrafish.,"Inherited leukodystrophies are genetic disorders characterized by abnormal white matter in the central nervous system. Although individually rare, there are more than 400 distinct types of leukodystrophies with a cumulative incidence of 1 in 4500 live births. The pathophysiology of most leukodystrophies is poorly understood, there are treatments for only a few, and there is significant morbidity and mortality, suggesting a critical need for improvements in this field. A variety of animal, cell, and induced pluripotent stem cell-derived models have been developed for leukodystrophies, but with significant limitations in all models. Many leukodystrophies lack animal models, and extant models often show no or mixed recapitulation of key phenotypes. Zebrafish (Danio rerio) have become increasingly used as disease models for studying leukodystrophies due to their early onset of disease phenotypes and conservation of molecular and neurobiological mechanisms. Here, we focus on reviewing new zebrafish disease models for leukodystrophy or models with recent progress. This includes discussion of leukodystrophy with vanishing white matter disease, X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy, Zellweger spectrum disorders and peroxisomal disorders, PSAP deficiency, metachromatic leukodystrophy, Krabbe disease, hypomyelinating leukodystrophy-8/4H leukodystrophy, Aicardi-Goutières syndrome, RNASET2-deficient cystic leukoencephalopathy, hereditary diffuse leukoencephalopathy with spheroids-1 (CSF1R-related leukoencephalopathy), and ultra-rare leukodystrophies. Zebrafish models offer important potentials for the leukodystrophy field, including testing of new variants in known genes; establishing causation of newly discovered genes; and early lead compound identification for therapies. There are also unrealized opportunities to use humanized zebrafish models which have been sparsely explored.","Hung-Yu Shih, Quentin Raas, Joshua L Bonkowsky",2024

Combination HSCT and intravenous AAV-mediated gene therapy in a canine model proves pivotal for translation of Krabbe disease therapy.,"Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) is the only approved treatment for presymptomatic infantile globoid cell leukodystrophy (GLD [Krabbe disease]). However, correction of disease is not complete, and outcomes remain poor. Herein we evaluated HSCT, intravenous (IV) adeno-associated virus rh10 vector (AAVrh10) gene therapy, and combination HSCT + IV AAVrh10 in the canine model of GLD. While HSCT alone resulted in no increase in survival as compared with untreated GLD dogs (∼16 weeks of age), combination HSCT + IV AAVrh10 at a dose of 4E13 genome copies (gc)/kg resulted in delayed disease progression and increased survival beyond 1 year of age. A 5-fold increase in AAVrh10 dose to 2E14 gc/kg, in combination with HSCT, normalized neurological dysfunction up to 2 years of age. IV AAVrh10 alone resulted in an average survival to 41.2 weeks of age. In the peripheral nervous system, IV AAVrh10 alone or in addition to HSCT normalized nerve conduction velocity, improved ultrastructure, and normalized GALC enzyme activity and psychosine concentration. In the central nervous system, only combination therapy at the highest dose was able to restore galactosylceramidase activity and psychosine concentrations to within the normal range. These data have now guided clinical translation of systemic AAV gene therapy as an addition to HSCT (NCT04693598, NCT05739643).","Allison M Bradbury, Jessica Bagel, Gary Swain, Keiko Miyadera, Jill P Pesayco, Charles-Antoine Assenmacher, Becky Brisson, Ian Hendricks, Xiao H Wang, Zachary Herbst, Nettie Pyne, Patricia Odonnell, G Diane Shelton, Michael Gelb, Neil Hackett, Paul Szabolcs, Charles H Vite, Maria Escolar",2024
Globoid Cell Leukodystrophy (Krabbe Disease): An Update.,"Globoid cell leukodystrophy or Krabbe is a disease that affects children as well as adults who have mutations in the gene encoding the enzyme galactosylceramidase/galctocerebrosidase (GALC), resulting in the deposition of the toxic lipid D-galactosyl-beta1-1' sphingosine (GalSph or psychosine). Several therapeutic modalities were used to treat patients with Krabbe disease, including hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, enzyme replacement therapy, autophagy activators, intravenous immunoglobulin, and inhibitors of the Pyroptosis process, among many other approaches. In this article, I will briefly discuss the disease in both human and animal model, describe recent clinical observations as well as methods utilizing genetic analysis for diagnosis, and finally review recent advances in treating this rare and devastating disease.",Azzam A Maghazachi,2023
Nanomedicines to treat rare neurological disorders: The case of Krabbe disease.,"The brain remains one of the most challenging therapeutic targets due to the low and selective permeability of the blood-brain barrier and complex architecture of the brain tissue. Nanomedicines, despite their relatively large size compared to small molecules and nucleic acids, are being heavily investigated as vehicles to delivery therapeutics into the brain. Here we elaborate on how nanomedicines may be used to treat rare neurodevelopmental disorders, using Krabbe disease (globoid cell leukodystrophy) to frame the discussion. As a monogenetic disorder and lysosomal storage disease affecting the nervous system, the lessons learned from examining nanoparticle delivery to the brain in the context of Krabbe disease can have a broader impact on the treatment of various other neurodevelopmental and neurodegenerative disorders. In this review, we introduce the epidemiology and genetic basis of Krabbe disease, discuss current in vitro and in vivo models of the disease, as well as current therapeutic approaches either approved or at different stage of clinical developments. We then elaborate on challenges in particle delivery to the brain, with a specific emphasis on methods to transport nanomedicines across the blood-brain barrier. We highlight nanoparticles for delivering therapeutics for the treatment of lysosomal storage diseases, classified by the therapeutic payload, including gene therapy, enzyme replacement therapy, and small molecule delivery. Finally, we provide some useful hints on the design of nanomedicines for the treatment of rare neurological disorders.","Thomas Lee Moore, Giovanna Pannuzzo, Gabriella Costabile, Anna Lisa Palange, Raffaele Spanò, Miguel Ferreira, Adriana Carol Eleonora Graziano, Paolo Decuzzi, Venera Cardile",2023
Untargeted Lipidomic Approach for Studying Different Nervous System Tissues of the Murine Model of Krabbe Disease.,"Krabbe disease is a rare neurodegenerative disease with an autosomal recessive character caused by a mutation in the <i>GALC</i> gene. The mutation leads to an accumulation of psychosine and a subsequent degeneration of oligodendrocytes and Schwann cells. Psychosine is the main biomarker of the disease. The Twitcher mouse is the most commonly used animal model to study Krabbe disease. Although there are many references to this model in the literature, the lipidomic study of nervous system tissues in the Twitcher model has received little attention. This study focuses on the comparison of the lipid profiles of four nervous system tissues (brain, cerebellum, spinal cord, and sciatic nerve) in the Twitcher mouse compared to the wild-type mouse. Altogether, approximately 230 molecular species belonging to 19 lipid classes were annotated and quantified. A comparison at the levels of class, molecular species, and lipid building blocks showed significant differences between the two groups, particularly in the sciatic nerve. The in-depth study of the lipid phenotype made it possible to hypothesize the genes and enzymes involved in the changes. The integration of metabolic data with genetic data may be useful from a systems biology perspective to gain a better understanding of the molecular basis of the disease.","Husam B R Alabed, Ambra Del Grosso, Valeria Bellani, Lorena Urbanelli, Sara Carpi, Miriam De Sarlo, Lorenzo Bertocci, Laura Colagiorgio, Sandra Buratta, Luca Scaccini, Dorotea Frongia Mancini, Ilaria Tonazzini, Marco Cecchini, Carla Emiliani, Roberto Maria Pellegrino",2023
