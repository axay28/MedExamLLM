[Clinical characteristics of children with MT-TK gene m.8344A>G variation].,"<b>Objective:</b> To summarize the clinical characteristics of children carrying the m.8344A>G variant of MT-TK gene. <b>Methods:</b> A case series study was conducted to retrospectively collect data of 22 children with mitochondrial disease caused by MT-TK gene m.8344A>G variation who were treated at the Department of Neurology of Beijing Children's Hospital of Capital Medical University from January 2012 to January 2024. Their clinical data, laboratory tests, muscle pathology, genetic testing, and the follow-up results were analyzed. Pearson correlation analysis was used for correlation analysis. <b>Results:</b> Among the 22 children, there were 13 boys and 9 girls. The age of onset was 5.00 (2.75, 9.00) years. Fifteen children had myoclonic epilepsy with ragged-red fibers (MERRF), 3 had Leigh syndrome (LS), and 4 had LS-MERRF overlap syndrome (LS-MERRF). Myoclonus presented and worsened progressively in all 15 MERRF children, with 10 as the initial symptom and 5 developing progressively during the disease course. Myoclonus was predominantly focal, worsening with fine motor tasks or stress. Electroencephalogram monitoring in the 15 MERRF children revealed myoclonic seizures in 10 children, with 6 classified as myoclonic epilepsy, and 4 as subcortical myoclonus. Two children had generalized myoclonic seizures, and 1 each had absence seizures and generalized seizures. Twelve children had cerebellar ataxia, 10 children exhibited exercise intolerance, and 8 children had muscle weakness. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed periventricular white matter involvement in 1 child and bilateral hippocampal involvement in 1 child, likely due to frequent seizures. All 3 children with LS exhibited developmental regressions, accompanied with 2 symptoms include cerebellar ataxia, muscle weakness, and dysphagia. The clinical manifestations of 4 LS-MERRF overlap children presented with combined features of MERRF and LS. Cranial MRI in the 7 LS and LS-MERRF children showed brainstem involvement (all affecting the midbrain) in 6 children and basal ganglia involvement in 4 children. Among the 22 children, 12 had m.8344A>G variant levels >90%, 3 had >80%-90%, 4 had >70%-80%, and 3 had >60%-70%. Higher variant level correlated with the LS phenotype and earlier onset age (<i>r</i>=0.47, -0.50; <i>P</i>=0.018 and 0.029, respectively). Sanger sequencing in 19 mothers revealed m.8344A>G variations in 18, with 4 showing exercise intolerance. Follow-up of 13 children on antimyoclonic treatment showed>75% reduction in seizures with levetiracetam monotherapy in 2 children, with combination therapy required in others. Most achieved >50% seizures reduction within 2 years, but the effectiveness declined with disease progression. <b>Conclusions:</b> The m.8344A>G variant is rare, with MERRF being the most common phenotype, while LS and LS-MERRF are less common. Children with higher ratio of the m.8344A>G variant are more likely to present LS phenotype. Myoclonus, primarily focal, is a key feature, with levetiracetam as the first-line treatment and benzodiazepines recommended for refractory cases.","M Z Wang, H F Jiang, T Y Song, C L Xu, H Li, M H Song, F Fang",2024
A Comprehensive Approach to the Diagnosis of Leigh Syndrome Spectrum.,"Leigh syndrome spectrum (LSS) is a novel nomenclature that encompasses both classical Leigh syndrome and Leigh-like phenotypes. Given the heterogeneity of disease presentation, a new consensus published recently addressed the main issues and proposed general guidelines towards diagnosis. Based on these recommendations, we developed a simple pipeline that can be useful in the diagnosis of LSS.","Manuela Schubert Baldo, Luísa Azevedo, Margarida Paiva Coelho, Esmeralda Martins, Laura Vilarinho",2024
Ndufs4 knockout mice with isolated complex I deficiency engage a futile adaptive brain response.,"Paediatric Leigh syndrome (LS) is an early-onset and fatal neurodegenerative disorder lacking treatment options. LS is frequently caused by mutations in the NDUFS4 gene, encoding an accessory subunit of mitochondrial complex I (CI), the first complex of the oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) system. Whole-body Ndufs4 knockout (KO) mice (WB-KO mice) are widely used to study isolated CI deficiency, LS pathology and interventions. These animals develop a brain-specific phenotype via an incompletely understood pathomechanism. Here we performed a quantitative analysis of the sub-brain proteome in six-weeks old WB-KO mice vs. wildtype mice. Brain regions comprised of a brain slice (BrSl), cerebellum (CB), cerebral cortex (CC), hippocampus (HC), inferior colliculus (IC), and superior colliculus (SC). Proteome analysis demonstrated similarities between CC/HC, and between IC/SC, whereas BrSl and CB differed from these two groups and each other. All brain regions displayed greatly reduced levels of two CI structural subunits (NDUFS4, NDUFA12) and an increased level of the CI assembly factor NDUFAF2. The level of CI-Q module subunits was significantly more reduced in IC/SC than in BrSl/CB/CC/HC, whereas other OXPHOS complex levels were not reduced. Gene ontology and pathway analysis demonstrated specific and common proteome changes between brain regions. Across brain regions, upregulation of cold-shock-associated proteins, mitochondrial fatty acid (FA) oxidation and synthesis (mtFAS) were the most prominent. FA-related pathways were predominantly upregulated in CB and HC. Based upon these results, we argue that stimulation of these pathways is futile and pro-pathological and discuss alternative strategies for therapeutic intervention in LS. SIGNIFICANCE: The Ndufs4 knockout mouse model is currently the most relevant and most widely used animal model to study the brain-linked pathophysiology of human Leigh Syndrome (LS) and intervention strategies. We demonstrate that the Ndufs4 knockout brain engages futile and pro-pathological responses. These responses explain both negative and positive outcomes of intervention studies in Leigh Syndrome mice and patients, thereby guiding novel intervention opportunities.","Melissa A E van de Wal, Cenna Doornbos, Janne Bibbe, Judith R Homberg, Clara van Karnebeek, Martijn A Huynen, Jaap Keijer, Evert M van Schothorst, Peter A C 't Hoen, Mirian C H Janssen, Merel J W Adjobo-Hermans, Mariusz R Wieckowski, Werner J H Koopman",2024
Increased ketone levels as a key magnetic resonance spectroscopic findings during acute exacerbation in <i>ECHS1</i>-related Leigh syndrome.,"Short-chain enoyl-CoA hydratase, encoded by <i>ECHS1,</i> plays a major role in the valine catabolic pathway and mitochondrial fatty acid β-oxidation. Deficiency of this enzyme causes Leigh syndrome. Herein, we report a case of <i>ECHS1</i>-related Leigh syndrome with a prominent ketone body spectrum on magnetic resonance spectroscopy during acute exacerbation. A 6-month-old boy with mild motor developmental delay presented with disturbances of consciousness and hypercapnia without prior infection or feeding failure. Upon admission, investigations revealed prominent ketosis and elevated 2,3-dihydroxy-2-methylbutyric acid excretion. Brain magnetic resonance imaging revealed symmetrical T2 prolongation with restricted diffusion in the basal ganglia. Magnetic resonance spectroscopy showed a prominent ketone body spectrum in the cerebral white matter, and prominent ketone bodies, elevated lactate and markedly decreased N-acetylaspartate levels in the basal ganglia. Genetic analysis identified compound heterozygous variants of <i>ECHS1</i>. Short-chain enoyl-CoA hydratase deficiency is a disease for which a valine-restricted diet is reported to be beneficial, and early diagnosis is desirable. Severe ketosis and the ketone body magnetic resonance spectroscopy spectrum during acute exacerbation may aid in the diagnosis of this disease.","Yuka Murofushi, Kenta Ochiai, Madoka Yasukochi, Kentaro Sano, Keiko Ichimoto, Kei Murayama, Yasushi Okazaki, Taku Omata, Jun-Ichi Takanashi",2024
Disease models of Leigh syndrome: From yeast to organoids.,"Leigh syndrome (LS) is a severe mitochondrial disease that results from mutations in the nuclear or mitochondrial DNA that impairs cellular respiration and ATP production. Mutations in more than 100 genes have been demonstrated to cause LS. The disease most commonly affects brain development and function, resulting in cognitive and motor impairment. The underlying pathogenesis is challenging to ascertain due to the diverse range of symptoms exhibited by affected individuals and the variability in prognosis. To understand the disease mechanisms of different LS-causing mutations and to find a suitable treatment, several different model systems have been developed over the last 30 years. This review summarizes the established disease models of LS and their key findings. Smaller organisms such as yeast have been used to study the biochemical properties of causative mutations. Drosophila melanogaster, Danio rerio, and Caenorhabditis elegans have been used to dissect the pathophysiology of the neurological and motor symptoms of LS. Mammalian models, including the widely used Ndufs4 knockout mouse model of complex I deficiency, have been used to study the developmental, cognitive, and motor functions associated with the disease. Finally, cellular models of LS range from immortalized cell lines and trans-mitochondrial cybrids to more recent model systems such as patient-derived induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs). In particular, iPSCs now allow studying the effects of LS mutations in specialized human cells, including neurons, cardiomyocytes, and even three-dimensional organoids. These latter models open the possibility of developing high-throughput drug screens and personalized treatments based on defined disease characteristics captured in the context of a defined cell type. By analyzing all these different model systems, this review aims to provide an overview of past and present means to elucidate the complex pathology of LS. We conclude that each approach is valid for answering specific research questions regarding LS, and that their complementary use could be instrumental in finding treatment solutions for this severe and currently untreatable disease.","Marie-Thérèse Henke, Alessandro Prigione, Markus Schuelke",2024
"Bi-Allelic Splicing Variant, c.153-2A > C in TOMM7 Is Associated With Leigh Syndrome.","Translocase of the outer mitochondrial membrane (TOMM) complex plays an important role in the transport of proteins from the cytoplasm into the mitochondria. TOMM7, one of the subunits of the TOMM complex, modulates its assembly and stability. Bi-allelic disease-causing variants in TOMM7 (MIM* 607980) have been previously reported in two unrelated families with a diverse phenotype of short stature, lipodystrophy, progeria, developmental delay, hypotonia, and skeletal dysplasia. We report a 4-month-old female child significantly affected with neonatal-onset hypotonia, lactic acidosis, optic atrophy, and neuroimaging findings suggestive of Leigh disease with a novel canonical splice variant, c.153-2A > C in TOMM7 (NM_019059.5). Further work done on cDNA of parents revealed the presence of shorter transcripts secondary to aberrant splicing.","Mayuri Yeole, Purvi Majethia, Shahyan Siddiqui, Katta Mohan Girisha, Anju Shukla, Periyasamy Radhakrishnan, Vivekananda Bhat",2024
Primary mitochondrial diseases.,"Primary mitochondrial diseases (PMDs) are a heterogeneous group of hereditary disorders characterized by an impairment of the mitochondrial respiratory chain. They are the most common group of genetic metabolic disorders, with a prevalence of 1 in 4,300 people. The presence of leukoencephalopathy is recognized as an important feature in many PMDs and can be a manifestation of mutations in both mitochondrial DNA (classic syndromes such as mitochondrial encephalomyopathy, lactic acidosis, and stroke-like episodes; myoclonic epilepsy with ragged-red fibers [RRFs]; Leigh syndrome; and Kearns-Sayre syndrome) and nuclear DNA (mutations in maintenance genes such as POLG, MPV17, and TYMP; Leigh syndrome; and mitochondrial aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase disorders). In this chapter, PMDs associated with white matter involvement are outlined, including details of clinical presentations, brain MRI features, and elements of differential diagnoses. The current approach to the diagnosis of PMDs and management strategies are also discussed. A PMD diagnosis in a subject with leukoencephalopathy should be considered in the presence of specific brain MRI features (for example, cyst-like lesions, bilateral basal ganglia lesions, and involvement of both cerebral hemispheres and cerebellum), in addition to a complex neurologic or multisystem disorder. Establishing a genetic diagnosis is crucial to ensure appropriate genetic counseling, multidisciplinary team input, and eligibility for clinical trials.","Chiara Pizzamiglio, Michael G Hanna, Robert D S Pitceathly",2024
Ndufs4 inactivation in glutamatergic neurons reveals swallow-breathing discoordination in a mouse model of Leigh Syndrome.,"Swallowing, both nutritive and non-nutritive, is highly dysfunctional in children with Leigh Syndrome (LS) and contributes to the need for both gastrostomy and tracheostomy tube placement. Without these interventions aspiration of food, liquid, and mucus occur resulting in repeated bouts of respiratory infection. No study has investigated whether mouse models of LS, a neurometabolic disorder, exhibit dysfunctions in neuromuscular activity of swallow and breathing integration. We used a genetic mouse model of LS in which the NDUFS4 gene is knocked out (KO) specifically in Vglut2 or Gad2 neurons. We found increased variability of the swallow motor pattern, disruption in breathing regeneration post swallow, and water-induced apneas only in Vglut2 KO mice. These physiological changes likely contribute to weight loss and premature death seen in this mouse model. Following chronic hypoxia (CH) exposure, swallow motor pattern, breathing regeneration, weight, and life expectancy were not changed in the Vglut2-Ndufs4-KO CH mice compared to control, indicating a rescue of phenotypes. These findings show that like patients with LS, Ndufs4 mouse models of LS exhibit swallow impairments as well as swallow-breathing dyscoordination alongside the other phenotypic traits described in previous studies. Understanding this aspect of LS will open roads for the development of future more efficacious therapeutic intervention for this illness.","Alyssa Huff, Luiz Marcelo Oliveira, Marlusa Karlen-Amarante, Favour Ebiala, Jan Marino Ramirez, Franck Kalume",2024

"Characterization of Shy1, the Schizosaccharomyces pombe homolog of human SURF1.","Cytochrome c oxidase (complex IV) is the terminal enzyme in the mitochondrial respiratory chain. As a rare neurometabolic disorder caused by mutations in the human complex IV assembly factor SURF1, Leigh Syndrome (LS) is associated with complex IV deficiency. In this study, we comprehensively characterized Schizosaccharomyces pombe Shy1, the homolog of human SURF1. Bioinformatics analysis revealed that Shy1 contains a conserved SURF1 domain that links to the biogenesis of complex IV and shares high structural similarity with its homologs in Saccharomyces cerevisiae and humans. Our study showed that Shy1 is required for the expression of mtDNA-encoded genes and physically interacts with structural subunits and assembly factors of complex IV. Interestingly, Rip1, the subunit of ubiquinone-cytochrome c oxidoreductase or cytochrome bc<sub>1</sub> complex (complex III), can also co-immunoprecipitate with Shy1, suggesting Shy1 may be involved in the assembly of the mitochondrial respiratory chain supercomplexes. This conclusion is further corroborated by our BN-PAGE analysis. Unlike its homologs, deletion of shy1 does not critically disrupt respiratory chain assembly, indicating the presence of the compensatory mechanism(s) within S. pombe that ensure mitochondrial functionality. Collectively, our investigation elucidates that Shy1 plays a pivotal role in the sustainability of the regular function of mitochondria by participating in the assembly of complex IV in S. pombe.","Ying Luo, Yuanqi Xu, Fawad Ahmad, Gang Feng, Ying Huang",2024

"Characterization of two iPSC lines from patients with maternally inherited leigh (MILS) and neuropathy, ataxia, and retinitis pigmentosa (NARP) syndrome carrying the MT-ATP6 m.8993 T>G mutation at different degrees of heteroplasmy.","Human-derived experimental systems such as induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived models are useful tools to study mechanisms and potential therapeutic approaches for mitochondrial disorders. Here, we generated two iPSC lines from fibroblasts of patients carrying mutations at MT-ATP6 (m.8993 T>G). One patient with 96 % heteroplasmy suffered from Neuropathy, Ataxia, and Retinitis pigmentosa (NARP) syndrome, while the other patient with a homoplasmic mutation suffered from Maternally Inherited Leigh Syndrome (MILS). For reprogramming, we delivered reprogramming factors using Sendai virus and evaluated the pluripotency characteristics of the derived iPSCs. The degree of heteroplasmy remained stable after reprogramming.","Anna Maria Haschke, Sebastian Diecke, Markus Schuelke",2024
Severe mitochondrial encephalomyopathy caused by <i>de novo</i> variants in <i>OPA1</i> gene.,"Mitochondria adjust their shape in response to the different energetic and metabolic requirements of the cell, through extremely dynamic fusion and fission events. Several highly conserved dynamin-like GTPases are involved in these processes and, among those, the OPA1 protein is a key player in the fusion of inner mitochondrial membranes. Hundreds of monoallelic or biallelic pathogenic gene variants have been described in <i>OPA1</i>, all associated with a plethora of clinical phenotypes without a straightforward genotype-phenotype correlation.","Michela Di Nottia, Teresa Rizza, Enrico Baruffini, Claudia Nesti, Alessandra Torraco, Daria Diodato, Diego Martinelli, Flavio Dal Canto, Alexandru Ionut Gilea, Martina Zoccola, Barbara Siri, Carlo Dionisi-Vici, Enrico Bertini, Filippo Maria Santorelli, Paola Goffrini, Rosalba Carrozzo",2024
Cannabidiol ameliorates mitochondrial disease via PPARγ activation in preclinical models.,"Mutations in mitochondrial energy-producing genes lead to a heterogeneous group of untreatable disorders known as primary mitochondrial diseases (MD). Leigh syndrome (LS) is the most common pediatric MD and is characterized by progressive neuromuscular affectation and premature death. Here, we show that daily cannabidiol (CBD) administration significantly extends lifespan and ameliorates pathology in two LS mouse models, and improves cellular function in fibroblasts from LS patients. CBD delays motor decline and neurodegenerative signs, improves social deficits and breathing abnormalities, decreases thermally induced seizures, and improves neuropathology in affected brain regions. Mechanistically, we identify peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARγ) as a key nuclear receptor mediating CBD's beneficial effects, while also providing proof of dysregulated PPARγ expression and activity as a common feature in both mouse neurons and fibroblasts from LS patients. Taken together, our results provide the first evidence for CBD as a potential treatment for LS.","Emma Puighermanal, Marta Luna-Sánchez, Alejandro Gella, Gunter van der Walt, Andrea Urpi, María Royo, Paula Tena-Morraja, Isabella Appiah, Maria Helena de Donato, Fabien Menardy, Patrizia Bianchi, Anna Esteve-Codina, Laura Rodríguez-Pascau, Cristina Vergara, Mercè Gómez-Pallarès, Giovanni Marsicano, Luigi Bellocchio, Marc Martinell, Elisenda Sanz, Sandra Jurado, Francesc Xavier Soriano, Pilar Pizcueta, Albert Quintana",2024
Mitochondria transfer-based therapies reduce the morbidity and mortality of Leigh syndrome.,"Mitochondria transfer is a recently described phenomenon in which donor cells deliver mitochondria to acceptor cells<sup>1-3</sup>. One possible consequence of mitochondria transfer is energetic support of neighbouring cells; for example, exogenous healthy mitochondria can rescue cell-intrinsic defects in mitochondrial metabolism in cultured ρ<sup>0</sup> cells or Ndufs4<sup>-</sup><sup>/-</sup> peritoneal macrophages<sup>4-7</sup>. Exposing haematopoietic stem cells to purified mitochondria before autologous haematopoietic stem cell transplantation allowed for treatment of anaemia in patients with large-scale mitochondrial DNA mutations<sup>8,9</sup>, and mitochondria transplantation was shown to minimize ischaemic damage to the heart<sup>10-12</sup>, brain<sup>13-15</sup> and limbs<sup>16</sup>. However, the therapeutic potential of using mitochondria transfer-based therapies to treat inherited mitochondrial diseases is unclear. Here we demonstrate improved morbidity and mortality of the Ndufs4<sup>-</sup><sup>/-</sup> mouse model of Leigh syndrome (LS) in multiple treatment paradigms associated with mitochondria transfer. Transplantation of bone marrow from wild-type mice, which is associated with release of haematopoietic cell-derived extracellular mitochondria into circulation and transfer of mitochondria to host cells in multiple organs, ameliorates LS in mice. Furthermore, administering isolated mitochondria from wild-type mice extends lifespan, improves neurological function and increases energy expenditure of Ndufs4<sup>-</sup><sup>/-</sup> mice, whereas mitochondria from Ndufs4<sup>-</sup><sup>/-</sup> mice did not improve neurological function. Finally, we demonstrate that cross-species administration of human mitochondria to Ndufs4<sup>-</sup><sup>/-</sup> mice also improves LS. These data suggest that mitochondria transfer-related approaches can be harnessed to treat mitochondrial diseases, such as LS.","Ritsuko Nakai, Stella Varnum, Rachael L Field, Henyun Shi, Rocky Giwa, Wentong Jia, Samantha J Krysa, Eva F Cohen, Nicholas Borcherding, Russell P Saneto, Rick C Tsai, Masashi Suganuma, Hisashi Ohta, Takafumi Yokota, Jonathan R Brestoff",2024

"dldhcri3 zebrafish exhibit altered mitochondrial ultrastructure, morphology, and dysfunction partially rescued by probucol or thiamine.","Dihydrolipoamide dehydrogenase (DLD) deficiency is a recessive mitochondrial disease caused by variants in DLD, the E3 subunit of mitochondrial α-keto (or 2-oxo) acid dehydrogenase complexes. DLD disease symptoms are multisystemic, variably manifesting as Leigh syndrome, neurodevelopmental disability, seizures, cardiomyopathy, liver disease, fatigue, and lactic acidemia. While most DLD disease symptoms are attributed to dysfunction of the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex, the effects of other α-keto acid dehydrogenase deficiencies remain unclear. Current therapies for DLD deficiency are ineffective, with no vertebrate animal model available for preclinical study. We created a viable Danio rerio (zebrafish) KO model of DLD deficiency, dldhcri3. Detailed phenotypic characterization revealed shortened larval survival, uninflated swim bladder, hepatomegaly and fatty liver, and reduced swim activity. These animals displayed increased pyruvate and lactate levels, with severe disruption of branched-chain amino acid catabolism manifest as increased valine, leucine, isoleucine, α-ketoisovalerate, and α-ketoglutarate levels. Evaluation of mitochondrial ultrastructure revealed gross enlargement, severe cristae disruption, and reduction in matrix electron density in liver, intestines, and muscle. Therapeutic modeling of candidate therapies demonstrated that probucol or thiamine improved larval swim activity. Overall, this vertebrate model demonstrated characteristic phenotypic and metabolic alterations of DLD disease, offering a robust platform to screen and characterize candidate therapies.","Manuela Lavorato, Donna Iadarola, Cristina Remes, Prabhjot Kaur, Chynna Broxton, Neal D Mathew, Rui Xiao, Christoph Seiler, Eiko Nakamaru-Ogiso, Vernon E Anderson, Marni J Falk",2024
Phenotypic assessment of Cox10 variants and their implications for Leigh Syndrome.,"Cox10 is an enzyme required for the activity of cytochrome c oxidase.

The clinical and genetic spectrum of mitochondrial diseases in China: A multicenter retrospective cross-sectional study.,"Mitochondrial diseases (MtDs) present diverse clinical phenotypes, yet large-scale studies are hindered by their rarity. This retrospective, multicenter study, conducted across five Chinese hospitals' neurology departments from 2009 to 2019, aimed to address this gap. Nationwide, 1351 patients were enrolled, with a median onset age of 14.0 (18.5) years. The predominant phenotype was mitochondrial encephalomyopathy, lactic acidosis, and stroke-like episodes (MELAS) (45.0%). Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) mutations were prevalent (87.4%), with m.3243A>G being the most common locus (48.7%). Meanwhile, POLG mutations in nuclear DNA (nDNA) accounted for 16.5%. Comparative analysis based on age groups (with a cut-off at 14 years) revealed the highest prevalence of MELAS, with Leigh syndrome (LS) and chronic progressive external ophthalmoplegia (CPEO) being the second most common phenotypes in junior and senior groups, respectively. Notably, the most commonly mutated nuclear genes varied across age groups. In conclusion, MELAS predominated in this Chinese MtD cohort, underscored by m.3243A>G and POLG as principal mtDNA mutations and pathogenic nuclear genes. The phenotypic and genotypic disparities observed among different age cohorts highlight the complex nature of MtDs.","Yang Zhao, Xutong Zhao, Kunqian Ji, Junling Wang, Yuying Zhao, Jie Lin, Qiang Gang, Meng Yu, Yun Yuan, Haishan Jiang, Chong Sun, Fang Fang, Chuanzhu Yan, Zhaoxia Wang",2024

A Method for Producing Induced Pluripotent Stem Cell-Derived Cardiomyocytes from Leigh Syndrome Patients for Its Application in Disease Modeling and Drug Validation.,"Leigh syndrome (LS), a complex multisystemic disorder, poses significant challenges in genetic medicine due to its intricate pathogenesis and wide-ranging clinical manifestations. Notably, these arise from mutations in either nuclear genetic DNA or mitochondrial DNA, affecting ATP production and resulting in diverse clinical outcomes. The unpredictable trajectory of this disease, ranging from severe developmental delays to early mortality, underscores the need for improved therapeutic solutions. This research pivots toward the novel use of induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) as a promising platform for understanding disease mechanisms and spearheading patient-specific drug discoveries. Given the past successes of iPSCs in delineating organ-specific disorders and the recent endorsement of human iPSC-derived cardiomyocytes (CMs) by the FDA for drug evaluation, our work seeks to bridge this innovation to Leigh syndrome research. We detail a methodological approach to generate iPSCs from LS patients and differentiate them into iPSCs-CMs. Using multi-electrode array (MEA) analyses, we evaluate the field potential of these cells, spotlighting the potential of hiPSC-CM in drug validation and disease modeling. This pioneering approach offers a glimpse into the future of patient-centric therapeutic interventions for Leigh/Leigh-like syndrome.","Keshav Narayan Alagarsamy, Abhay Srivastava, Sanjiv Dhingra",2024

MRI showed bilateral symmetrical lesions in basal ganglia, midbrain, and brainstem consistent with Leigh syndrome. Signal abnormalities were also present within the cervical cord, with enhancement of multiple cranial, spinal, and cauda equina nerve roots. Genetic testing confirmed compound heterozygosity for two pathogenic variants in SURF1 implicated in Leigh syndrome.

Mechanisms and Future Research Perspectives on Mitochondrial Diseases Associated with Isoleucyl-tRNA Synthetase Gene Mutations.,"Aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases are essential enzymes for the accurate translation of genetic information. IARS1 and IARS2 are isoleucyl-tRNA synthetases functioning in the cytoplasm and mitochondria, respectively, with genetic mutations in these enzymes causing diverse clinical phenotypes in specific organs and tissues. Mutations in <i>IARS1</i> and <i>IARS2</i> have recently been linked to mitochondrial diseases. This review aims to explore the relationship between IARS1 and IARS2 and these diseases, providing a comprehensive overview of their association with mitochondrial diseases. Mutations in <i>IARS1</i> cause weak calf syndrome in cattle and mitochondrial diseases in humans, leading to growth retardation and liver dysfunction. Mutations in <i>IARS2</i> are associated with Leigh syndrome, craniosynostosis and abnormal genitalia syndrome. Future research is expected to involve genetic analysis of a larger number of patients, identifying new mutations in <i>IARS1</i> and <i>IARS2</i>, and elucidating their impact on mitochondrial function. Additionally, genetically modified mice and the corresponding phenotypic analysis will serve as powerful tools for understanding the functions of these gene products and unraveling disease mechanisms. This will likely promote the development of new therapies and preventive measures.","Masaki Watanabe, Nobuya Sasaki",2024

Structural robustness of the NADH binding site in NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase (complex I).,"Energy converting NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase, complex I, is the first enzyme of respiratory chains in most eukaryotes and many bacteria. Mutations in genes encoding subunits of human complex I may lead to its dysfunction resulting in a diverse clinical pattern. The effect of mutations on the protein structure is not known. Here, we focus on mutations R88G, E246K, P252R and E377K that are found in subunit NDUFV1 comprising the NADH binding site of complex I. Homologous mutations were introduced into subunit NuoF of Aquifex aeolicus complex I and it was attempted to crystallize variants of the electron input module, NuoEF, with bound substrates in the oxidized and reduced state. The E377K variant did not form crystals most likely due to an improper protein assembly. The architecture of the NADH binding site is hardly affected by the other mutations indicating its unexpected structural robustness. The R88G, E246K and P252R mutations led to small local structural rearrangements that might be related to their pathogenicity. These minor structural changes involve substrate binding, product release and the putative formation of reactive oxygen species. The structural consequences of the mutations as obtained with the bacterial enzyme might thus help to contribute to the understanding of disease causing mutations.","Sanaz Göppert-Asadollahpour, Daniel Wohlwend, Thorsten Friedrich",2024
