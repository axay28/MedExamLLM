Growth Rate Assessed by Vascular Deformation Mapping predicts Type B Aortic Dissection in Marfan Syndrome.,"Patients with Marfan syndrome (MFS) are at a high risk of type B dissection (TBAD). Aortic growth and elongation have been suggested as risk factors for TBAD. Vascular deformation mapping (VDM) is an image analysis technique for mapping 3D aortic growth on rouine computed tomography angiography (CTA) scans. We aimed to use VDM to examine the value of aortic growth rate in the descending thoracic aorta (DescAo), among other imaging biomarkers, to identify the factors associated with risk of TBAD in MFS.","Carlos Alberto Campello Jorge, Prabhvir Singh Marway, Nicasius S Tjahjadi, Heather Knauer, Himanshu J Patel, Marion A Hofmann Bowman, Kim A Eagle, Nicholas S Burris",2024
"[Sympathetic fire and rhythm of death ""Spiked Helmet"" in the Takotsubo cardiomyopathy. Case report].","The electrocardiographic sign ""Spiked Helmet"" (SHS) has been described in critically ill patients and is associated with a high risk of death. We present the case of a young individual with Marfan syndrome, who developed a Takotsubo cardiomyopathy and the electrocardiographic manifestation of SHS, 72 hours after the postoperative period for a ruptured abdominal aorta aneurysm. In this case, the factors that may justify the presentation of this electrocardiographic pattern are the thoraco-abdominal surgical intervention and Takotsubo cardiomyopathy, which together activated the sympathetic system, triggering the clinical-electrocardiographic manifestation.","Ernesto Kang Moreira, Carlos Loor Sabando, Mónica Delia Gilbert Orús, Paola Morejón Barragán, Mirella Barrera Rivera",2024
"Reclassification of an FBN1 variant emphasizes the importance of segregation analysis, information sharing, and multidisciplinary teamwork in understanding genetic variants in health and disease.","Marfan syndrome (MFS) is a complex connective tissue disorder characterized by considerable clinical variability. The diagnosis of MFS is based on the Ghent criteria, which require the presence of both clinical and genetic features. MFS is primarily caused by pathogenic alterations in FBN1, which encodes the fibrillin-1 protein. Fibrillin-1 comprises multiple domains rich in cysteine residues, with disulfide bonds formed between these residues. It has long been recognized that variants that alter or introduce cysteine residues damage protein function, leading to the development of MFS. In this study, we report a cysteine-introducing variant: FBN1 variant, c.6724C>T (p.[Arg2242Cys]). We have observed this variant in several individuals without MFS, challenging our previous understanding of the underlying mechanism of MFS. This finding emphasizes the importance of revisiting and reevaluating our current knowledge in light of new and unexpected observations. Moreover, our study highlights the significance of incorporating local and national data on allele frequencies, as well as employing multidisciplinary phenotyping approaches, in the classification of genetic variants. By considering a wide range of information, we can enhance the accuracy and reliability of variant classification, ultimately improving the diagnosis and management of individuals with genetic disorders like MFS.","Dorte L Lildballe, Sara Markholt, Christina Daugaard Lyngholm, Qin Hao, Christina Fagerberg, Dorte Guldbrand Nielsen, Julius Hannibal Svensmark, Birgitte Rode Diness, Pernille A Gregersen",2024

Mid- to long-term radiological and respiratory outcomes following surgery for older early-onset scoliosis patients with Marfan syndrome.,"This study aimed to elucidate mid- to long-term radiological and respiratory outcomes in patients aged 7-11 years at index surgery with Marfan syndrome and early-onset scoliosis (EOS) in a retrospective multicenter study. Primary outcomes were final thoracic height and final percentage of predicted vital capacity (%VC) at or after 16 years of age. We identified 21 (6 male and 15 female) patients with a mean age of 9.9 years and mean follow-up period of 149.3 months. Fifteen patients underwent primary fusion, whereas six underwent growth-friendly surgery (GFS). The mean preoperative and final T1-T12 heights were 204.0 mm and 248.0 mm, respectively. Final pulmonary function tests were available for 16 patients, and the mean final %VC was 54.0% with 10 patients exhibiting a final %VC < 60%. A significant moderate association was observed between the final T1-T12 height and final %VC. The predicted final T1-T12 height required for a final %VC of 60% was approximately 260 mm. Although most older patients with Marfan syndrome and EOS acquired a considerably large final T1-T12 height, a larger thoracic height was required for satisfactory respiratory function in many cases; hence, GFS may be indicated even in this population.","Yuki Taniguchi, Ryoji Tauchi, Teppei Suzuki, Haruhisa Yanagida, Kei Watanabe, Takachika Shimizu, Yoshitaka Matsubayashi, Noriaki Kawakami",2024
Evaluation of the clinical features of an outpatient cohort with Marfan syndrome.,Marfan syndrome is a connective tissue disease with autosomal dominant inheritance and variable clinical presentation.

A familial case of aortic dilatation with p.Tyr470Cys in <i>TGFBR2</i> in which the phenotype included only vascular lesions.,"Hereditary connective tissue diseases have different risks of aortic dissection depending on the causative gene. We report a family with no extravascular phenotype and a clinical diagnosis of familial thoracic aortic aneurysm and dissection, but genetic testing confirmed p.Tyr470Cys in <i>TGFBR2</i>, which is typically the responsible gene for Loeys-Dietz syndrome. Validation of the clinical diagnosis by genetic testing is warranted.","Hidenori Yamamoto, Ayako Tanabe, Taichi Kato",2024
Coronary Artery Aneurysm Thrombosis in a Patient With Marfan Syndrome.,"Coronary artery aneurysm in adults is associated with connective tissue disorders, including Marfan syndrome. Coronary artery aneurysms are at risk for thrombosis, which obstructs coronary flow and thus results in myocardial infarction. We present a case of coronary artery aneurysm thrombosis in a patient with Marfan syndrome who presented with acute coronary syndrome.","Mohamed Ramzi Almajed, Abdulla Almajed, Shannon Antishin, Abdulmalik Saleem, Benjamin Wexler, Mustafa Mohammed, Thomas Keimig, Natesh Lingam, Khaled Abdul-Nour, Michael Hudson",2024
Florida Sleeve Technique for an Aortic Root Aneurysm in a Marfan Syndrome Patient.,Valve-sparing aortic root replacement is not widely performed due to technical requirements. The Florida sleeve technique (FST) is a new technique for aortic root remodeling with the preservation of the aortic valve without aortic root wall resection and coronary artery reconstruction. We successfully treated with the FST for a Marfan syndrome patient with an aortic root aneurysm and aortic valve insufficiency. We believe that this technique is very suitable for cases with moderately enlarged aortic roots. It could reduce surgical risks and prevent dilatation of the aortic root through coverage with a graft for a long time.,"Shinji Kanemitsu, Renta Ishikawa, Shunsuke Sakamoto, Toru Mizumoto",2024

"Exercise, Sports Participation, and Quality of Life in Young Patients with Heritable Thoracic Aortic Disease.","Patients with heritable thoracic aortic disease (HTAD)are often restricted from sports and certain types of exercise. This study was designed to investigate the effect of lifetime exercise exposure and competitive sports participation on quality of life (QOL) in patients aged 15-35 with syndromic [Marfan syndrome (MFS), Loeys-Dietz syndrome (LDS), vascular Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (vEDS)] and non-syndromic heritable thoracic aortic disease (nsHTAD).","Theodore J Millette, Randy K Ramcharitar, Oliver J Monfredi, Matthew J Thomas, Mark R Conaway, Peter N Dean",2024
Suture dehiscence in patients with connective tissue disease: Marfan and Weill-Marchesani syndromes.,"Marfan and Weill-Marchesani syndromes have a mutation of the fibrillin gene (FBN1), producing alteration of connective tissue, within ophthalmology, it is important to take into consideration this type of diseases in cogenetic alterations in this system will produce modifications at the level of the ocular structures generating problems of various types, Most of the literature refers to ectopia lentis and the complications derived from it, as secondary glaucoma. We present two patients, one with Marfan syndrome and the other with Weill-Marchesani syndrome, who developed lens dislocation, typical of their pathologies, which led them to undergo different surgeries. Both developed suture dehiscence after these surgeries, as a complication derived from their connective tissue involvement. We thus highlight the need for vigilance and extreme caution in the postoperative period of patients affected by this type of syndromes.","M M Valentín-Pastrana Aguilar, I Platas Moreno, N Muñoz Sanz, B Sandoval Cortés, J Herrera Pereiro, I Jiménez-Alfaro Morote",2024
Elective root replacement increases the risk of type B dissection in patients with Marfan syndrome.,"Marfan syndrome is a genetic disorder with increased risk of aortic dissection. Currently, type A aortic dissection risk is mitigated by aortic root replacement with Dacron. It is unclear if root replacement increases the risk of distal aortic disease given the noncompliant nature of Dacron.","Ryan Thomas, Arjune S Dhanekula, Peter Byers, Rachel Flodin, Scott DeRoo, Sherene Shalhub, Christopher R Burke",2024
Effects of resveratrol on aortic growth in patients with Marfan syndrome: a single-arm open-label multicentre trial.,"Resveratrol, a dietary supplement that intervenes in cellular metabolism, has been shown to reduce aortic growth rate in a mouse model of Marfan syndrome (MFS), a condition associated in humans with life-threatening aortic complications, often preceded by aortic dilatation. The primary objective of this study was to investigate the effects of resveratrol on aortic growth rate in patients with MFS .","Mitzi Marlotte van Andel, Daan Bosshardt, Eric M Schrauben, Renske Merton, Roland R L van Kimmenade, Arthur Scholte, Michael G Dickinson, Danielle Robbers-Visser, Aeilko H Zwinderman, Barbara Mulder, Aart J Nederveen, Pim van Ooij, Maarten Groenink, Vivian de Waard",2024
[Amaurosis fugax in Marfan syndrome with myxomatous degeneration].,"A 28-year-old male presented with a sudden, transient visual impairment in the right eye. Brain MRI revealed no obvious ischemic lesions, and he was diagnosed with amaurosis fugax. Physical examination revealed characteristic features of Marfan syndrome, along with a family history of tall stature and valvular heart disease. Further investigation revealed: 1) an ascending aortic aneurysm, 2) a bicuspid aortic valve with fenestration and regurgitation, and 3) a mitral valve prolapse with regurgitation. Genetic testing identified a heterozygous variant c.6905G>A of FBN1, confirming the diagnosis of Marfan syndrome. Bentall operation and mitral valve replacement were performed, resulting in a favorable outcome. Pathological examination showed extensive myxomatous degeneration with thickening of the aortic and mitral valves, suggesting a potential source of embolism.","Takeo Sato, Mari Satake, Hiroki Iitsuka, Masahiro Mimori, Tadashi Umehara, Chisen Takeuchi, Yasuyuki Iguchi",2024
Tracheal Stenosis Associated With Operation for Pneumothorax With Marfan Syndrome: A Case Report.,"Marfan syndrome is a genetic disorder in which impaired protein leads to connective tissue weakness. We herein report a case of unexpected tracheal stenosis that was diagnosed just before an operation for a recurrent right pneumothorax with Marfan syndrome. A 16-year-old boy with bilateral repeated pneumothoraces associated with Marfan syndrome came to our emergency room complaining of dyspnea. A chest radiograph showed recurrent right pneumothorax. An operation was planned due to prolonged air leakage even after chest tube drainage. On induction of general anesthesia for repairing pneumothorax, a sudden difficulty occurred during manual ventilation, and the blood oxygen saturation temporarily decreased to 50%. Therefore, emergent intubation with a single-lumen tube was applied, which led back to full saturation. Bronchoscopy revealed a tortuous and flattened trachea. An endobronchial blocker tube was applied due to difficulty in double-lumen tube insertion, and bullectomy was accomplished without any other unexpected events. Patients with Marfan syndrome may have asymptomatic tracheal stenosis due to structural abnormalities and latent tracheomalacia, and general anesthesia could be a trigger to develop the symptoms. Surgeons should bear this in mind, cooperate with anesthesiologists well, and prepare for emergent intubation when managing patients with Marfan syndrome in the perioperative settings.","Yosuke Hamada, Yoshinobu Ichiki, Hirozo Sakaguchi, Hiroyuki Nitanda, Hironori Ishida",2024
Late diagnosis of Marfan syndrome is associated with unplanned aortic surgery and cardiovascular death.,"Marfan syndrome (MFS) guidelines recommend optimal pharmacologic therapy (OPT) and replacement of the ascending aorta (RAA) at 5.0 cm in diameter to prevent acute type A aortic dissection (ATAAD) and death. The effect of early MFS diagnosis and initiation of therapy on outcomes is not known. Therefore, we sought to evaluate the effect of age at MFS diagnosis and therapy initiation on delayed RAA and death.","Jason Claus, Lauritz Schoof, Thomas S Mir, Anna Lena Kammal, Gerhard Schön, Kerstin Kutsche, Christian-Alexander Behrendt, Klaus Kallenbach, Tilo Kölbel, Christian Kubisch, Till Joscha Demal, Johannes Petersen, Jens Brickwedel, Michael Hübler, Christian Detter, Paulus Kirchhof, Eike Sebastian Debus, Meike Rybczynski, Yskert von Kodolitsch",2024

Hybrid approach to achieve secure distal seal zones during endovascular aortic repair in a patient with Marfan syndrome.,"This report details a hybrid approach for treatment of abdominal aortic aneurysm in a patient with Marfan syndrome (MFS). A 34-year-old patient with MFS and prior open thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysm repair underwent bilateral common iliac artery interposition graft repair and endovascular aortic repair. The bifurcated stent graft was implanted into the previous thoracoabdominal graft proximally and iliac interposition grafts distally. Postoperatively, the patient recovered uneventfully with sac regression to 4.5 cm through 2-year follow-up, without seal zone degeneration. This hybrid approach aimed to eliminate landing zone degeneration in patients with MFS undergoing endovascular repair.","Jesse Y Han, Herbert I James, Michelle Manesh, Alyssa J Pyun, Elizabeth Miranda, Sukgu M Han",2024
The Contribution of Mast Cells to the Regulation of Elastic Fiber Tensometry in the Skin Dermis of Children with Marfan Syndrome.,"Marfan syndrome (MFS) is a hereditary condition accompanied by disorders in the structural and regulatory properties of connective tissue, including elastic fibers, due to a mutation in the gene encodes for fibrillin-1 protein (FBN1 gene) and the synthesis of abnormal fibrillin-1 glycoprotein. Despite the high potential of mast cells (MCs) to remodel the extracellular matrix (ECM), their pathogenetic significance in MFS has not been considered yet. The group of patients with Marfan syndrome included two mothers and five children (three girls aged 4, 11, and 11 and two boys aged 12 and 13). Normal skin was examined in two children aged 11 and 12. Histochemical, monoplex, and multiplex immunohistochemical techniques; combined protocols of simultaneous histochemical and immunohistochemical staining (the results of staining were assessed using light, epifluorescence, and confocal microscopy); and bioinformatics algorithms for the quantitative analysis of detected targets were used to evaluate mast cells and their relationship with other cells from extracellular structures in the skin dermis. Analysis of the skin MC population in children with Marfan syndrome revealed a considerably increased number of intra-organic populations with the preservation of the specific Tryptase<sup>+</sup>Chymase<sup>+</sup>CPA3<sup>+</sup> protease profile typical of the skin. The features of the MC histotopography phenotype in MFS consisted of closer colocalization with elastic fibers, smooth muscle cells, and fibroblasts. MCs formed many intradermal clusters that synchronized the activity of cell functions in the stromal landscape of the tissue microenvironment with the help of spatial architectonics, including the formation of cell chains and the creation of fibrous niches. In MCs, the expression of specific proteases, TGF-β, and heparin increased, with targeted secretion of biologically active substances relative to the dermal elastic fibers, which had specific structural features in MFS, including abnormal variability in thickness along their entire length, alternating thickened and thinned areas, and uneven surface topography. This paper discusses the potential role of MCs in strain analysis (tensometry) of the tissue microenvironment in MFS. Thus, the quantitative and qualitative rearrangements of the skin MC population in MFS are aimed at altering the stromal landscape of the connective tissue. The results obtained should be taken into account when managing clinical signs of MFS manifested in other pathogenetically critical structures of internal organs, including the aorta, tendons, cartilage, and parenchymal organs.","Dmitrii Atiakshin, Ekaterina Nikolaeva, Alla Semyachkina, Andrey Kostin, Artem Volodkin, Sergey Morozov, Michael Ignatyuk, Liudmila Mikhaleva, Grigory Demyashkin, Daniel Elieh-Ali-Komi, Igor Buchwalow, Markus Tiemann",2024
