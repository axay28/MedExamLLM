[Progress and prospects in diagnosis and treatment of neurofibromatosis type 1].,"Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) is an autosomal dominant genetic disease caused by mutations in the <i>NF1</i> gene. The disease is characterized by neurofibromatosis, which simultaneously affects multiple systems such as nerves, skin, and bone, and has complex clinical manifestations. Since the National Institutes of Health (NIH) established diagnostic criteria in 1988, the diagnosis and treatment of NF1 have progressed significantly. However, due to the complexity of the disease and the lack of effective treatments, the diagnosis and treatment of NF1 still face many challenges. Strengthening multidisciplinary collaboration, improving and popularizing disease diagnosis and treatment strategies, and developing more effective drugs and treatment methods are the keys to further improve the treatment level of NF1 diseases.",Pi'nan Liu,2024

[Several suggestions for improving diagnosis and management of patients with neurofibromatosis type 1].,"Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) is an autosomal dominant genetic disease caused by the mutations in the <i>NF1</i> gene, with an incidence of approximately 1/3 000. Affecting multiple organs and systems throughout the body, NF1 caused a wide variety of clinical symptoms. A comprehensive multidisciplinary diagnostic and treatment model is needed to meet the diverse needs of NF1 patients and improve their quality of life. In recent years, the emergence of targeted therapies has further benefited NF1 patients, and the number of clinical consultations has increased dramatically. However, due to the rarity of the disease itself and insufficient attention previously, the standardized, systematic, and precise diagnosis and treatment model of NF1 still needs to be further improved. In this paper, we reviewed the current status of comprehensive diagnosis and treatment of NF1 in China, combine with our long-term experiences in diagnosis and treatment of this disease. Meanwhile, we propose future directions and several suggestions for the comprehensive diagnosis and treatment model for Chinese NF1 patients.","Qingfeng Li, Zhichao Wang, Chengjiang Wei",2024
Mechanical properties of pediatric low-grade gliomas in children with and without neurofibromatosis type 1.,"Prognoses for pediatric brain tumors are suboptimal, as even in low-grade tumors, management techniques can lead to damage in the developing brain. Therefore, advanced neuroimaging methods are critical for developing optimal management plans and improving patient care. Magnetic resonance elastography (MRE) has allowed for the characterization of adult gliomas by their mechanical properties, which are uniquely sensitive to the complex interplay of cellularity, vasculature, and interstitium. However, pediatric tumors differ in behavior and cytoarchitecture, and their mechanical properties have never been assessed.","Grace McIlvain, Laura L Hayes, Andrew W Walter, Lauren W Averill, Vinay Kandula, Curtis L Johnson, Rahul M Nikam",2024
Current state of spinal nerve sheath tumor management and future advances.,"Nerve sheath tumors are the most common tumors of the spine after meningiomas. They include schwannomas, neurofibroma, and malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors. These can arise sporadically or in association with tumor predisposition syndromes, including neurofibromatosis type 1, neurofibromatosis type 2, and schwannomatosis. Though surgery is the traditional mainstay of treatment for these tumors, the discovery of the genetic and molecular basis of these diseases in recent decades has prompted investigation into targeted therapies. Here, we give a clinical overview of spinal nerve sheath tumors, their imaging features, current management practices, and explore ongoing advances in systemic therapies.","Chloe Gui, Luxshikka Canthiya, Gelareh Zadeh, Suganth Suppiah",2024

Social cognition in adults with neurofibromatosis type 1.,"Adult patients with the genetic disease neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) frequently report social difficulties. To date, however, only two studies have explored whether these difficulties are caused by social cognition deficits, and these yielded contradictory data. The aim of the present study was to exhaustively assess social cognition abilities (emotion, theory of mind, moral reasoning, and social information processing) in adults with NF1, compared with a control group, and to explore links between social cognition and disease characteristics (mode of inheritance, severity, and visibility).","Julie Remaud, Jérémy Besnard, Sébastien Barbarot, Arnaud Roy",2024
Parent-child discrepancies in reports of child psychosocial functioning in neurofibromatosis type 1.,"Children with neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) are at an increased risk for social-emotional difficulties. These difficulties, including depression and anxiety, are typically measured through parental report of child functioning in research and rarely have children with NF1 rated their own well-being. Discrepancies between parent proxy- and child self-report of psychosocial functioning in other populations have been shown to relate to socioemotional problems and distress. This study examined the concordance of parent proxy- and child self-report of child behavioral and social-emotional functioning on selected Behavior Assessment System for Children-Second Edition subscales in families of children with NF1 and plexiform neurofibroma tumors (pNFs). We also sought to explore possible child, family, and community factors relating to discrepancies in reporting for youth with NF1 and pNFs. Overall, parents reported higher symptoms across psychosocial domains (anxiety, depression, and atypicality) in comparison to their children. Furthermore, characteristics like child sex, attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder diagnosis, and family functioning significantly predicted differences in ratings of child functioning. These findings indicate that multi-informant studies are crucial to understanding multiple perspectives among family members in symptom-reporting and risk factors for these discrepancies.

Stimulator of interferon gene facilitates recruitment of effector CD8 T cells that drive neurofibromatosis type 1 nerve tumor initiation and maintenance.,"Plexiform neurofibromas (PNFs) are benign nerve tumors driven by loss of the <i>NF1</i> tumor suppressor in Schwann cells. PNFs are rich in immune cells, but whether immune cells are necessary for tumorigenesis is unknown. We show that inhibition of stimulator of interferon gene (STING) reduces plasma CXCL10, tumor T cell and dendritic cell (DC) recruitment, and tumor formation. Further, mice lacking XCR-1<sup>+</sup> DCs showed reduced tumor-infiltrating T cells and PNF tumors. Antigen-presenting cells from tumor-bearing mice promoted CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell proliferation in vitro, and PNF T cells expressed high levels of CCL5, implicating T cell activation. Notably, tumors and nerve-associated macrophages were absent in Rag1<sup>-/-</sup>; Nf1<sup>f/f</sup>; DhhCre mice and adoptive transfer of CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells from tumor-bearing mice restored PNF initiation. In this setting, PNF shrunk upon subsequent T cell removal. Thus, STING pathway activation contributes to CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell-dependent inflammatory responses required for PNF initiation and maintenance.","Jay Pundavela, Samantha Anne Dinglasan, Melissa Touvron, Sarah A Hummel, Liang Hu, Tilat A Rizvi, Kwangmin Choi, David A Hildeman, Nancy Ratner",2024
Spontaneous Tension Hemothorax in a Patient With Neurofibromatosis Type 1.,"Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1), also known as von Recklinghausen disease, is the most common phacomatosis. It is characterized by neurofibromas but also manifests vascular complications including stenosis, arterial ectasia, and aneurysms. We report the case of an otherwise healthy 45-year-old male who developed a fatal tension hemothorax due to bleeding from the left costocervical artery. Tension hemothorax without trauma is rare except in cases with a rupture of an aortic aneurysm; we successfully treated the patient by promptly diagnosing tension hemothorax and performing chest drainage, as well as timely transcatheter arterial embolization (TAE) to control bleeding. When encountering shock patients with NF1, clinicians should be mindful of the potential for non-traumatic hemorrhagic complications due to vascular malformation.","Yuki Koike, Daiyu Kousen, Takayuki Kurinobu, Keiki Shimizu",2024
The Multimodality Management of Malignant Peripheral Nerve Sheath Tumours.,"Malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumours (MPNST) are aggressive sarcomas that have nerve sheath differentiation and can present at any anatomical site. They can arise from precursor neurofibroma in the context of neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) or as de novo and sporadic tumours in the absence of an underlying genetic predisposition. The primary therapeutic approach is most often radical surgery, with non-surgical modalities playing an important role, especially in locally advanced or metastatic cases. The aim of multimodality approaches is to optimize both local and systemic control while keeping to a minimum acute and late treatment morbidity. Advances in the understanding of the underlying biology of MPNSTs in both sporadic and NF-1-related contexts are essential for the management and implementation of novel therapeutic approaches.","Remus Seres, Hassan Hameed, Martin G McCabe, David Russell, Alexander T J Lee",2024
Proof of Concept for Genome Profiling of the Neurofibroma/Sarcoma Sequence in Neurofibromatosis Type 1.,"Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) is an autosomal dominant genetic disorder characterized by the predisposition to develop tumors such as malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors (MPNSTs) which represents the primary cause of death for NF1-affected patients. Regardless of the high incidence and mortality, the molecular mechanisms underneath MPNST growth and metastatic progression remain poorly understood. In this proof-of-concept study, we performed somatic whole-exome sequencing (WES) to profile the genomic alterations in four samples from a patient with NF1-associated MPNST, consisting of a benign plexiform neurofibroma, a primary MPNST, and metastases from lung and skin tissues. By comparing genomic patterns, we identified a high level of variability across samples with distinctive genetic changes which allow for the definition of profiles of the early phase with respect to the late metastatic stages. Pathogenic and likely pathogenic variants were abundant in the primary tumor, whereas the metastatic samples exhibited a high level of copy-number variations (CNVs), highlighting a possible genomic instability in the late phases. The most known MPNST-related genes, such as <i>TP53</i> and <i>SUZ12</i>, were identified in CNVs observed within the primary tumor. Pathway analysis of altered early genes in MPNST pointed to a potential role in cell motility, division and metabolism. Moreover, we employed survival analysis with the <i>TCGA</i> sarcoma genomic dataset on 262 affected patients, in order to corroborate the predictive significance of the identified early and metastatic MPNST driver genes. Specifically, the expression changes related to the mutated genes, such as in <i>RBMX</i>, <i>PNPLA6</i> and <i>AGAP2</i>, were associated with reduced patient survival, distinguishing them as potential prognostic biomarkers. This study underlines the relevance of integrating genomic results with clinical information for early diagnosis and prognostic understanding of tumor aggressiveness.","Ilenia Rita Cannizzaro, Mirko Treccani, Antonietta Taiani, Enrico Ambrosini, Sabrina Busciglio, Sofia Cesarini, Anita Luberto, Erika De Sensi, Barbara Moschella, Pierpacifico Gismondi, Cinzia Azzoni, Lorena Bottarelli, Giovanna Giordano, Domenico Corradi, Enrico Maria Silini, Valentina Zanatta, Federica Cennamo, Patrizia Bertolini, Patrizia Caggiati, Davide Martorana, Vera Uliana, Antonio Percesepe, Valeria Barili",2024
Duodenal ampulla neuroendocrine tumor and gastrointestinal stromal tumors in a case of neurofibromatosis type 1: a case report.,"Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF-1) is commonly associated with a variety of rare tumors. However, no case of multiple gastric gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GISTs) or duodenal ampulla neuroendocrine tumors (NETs) with multiple liver metastases in a patient with NF-1 has yet been reported. Here, we describe a case of a 55-year-old female patient with NF-1 whose serum Pro-Gastrin-Releasing Peptide (pro-GRP) levels were elevated. Gastrointestinal endoscopy and biopsy showed duodenal papilla space-occupying mass, and the pathological diagnosis turned out to be neuroendocrine tumors (NETs). During surgical exploration, multiple tumors were found on the serosal surface of the stomach and numerous miliary metastases in the liver. Following histopathological examination, it was determined that the liver metastases were NF-1 and the tumors in the gastric wall were GISTs. The patient benefited from targeted therapy and had an uneventful hospital stay. In this case, we emphasize treating patients with neurofibromatosis type 1 who exhibit abdominal symptoms with a high degree of clinical suspicion and performing thorough evaluations to rule out multiple tumors.","Tingting Zhang, Nanmu Yang, Peng Zheng, Jiaqi Chen, Bo Meng, Yi Wang, Dapeng Qiu, Xianzhou Zhang, Feng Han, Hao Zhuang, Lu Zheng",2024
Fungiform Papillae and Gustatory Function in Neurofibromatosis Type 1: A Case-Control Study.,"Fungiform papillae enlargement is a common oral manifestation of neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1).

"Intrathyroidal neurofibroma, a case report.","Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) is the most common neurocutaneous disease. It is characterized by café-au-lait spots, melanocytic hamartomas of the iris, pseudo-freckles, neurofibromas, and tumor predisposition. The presence of neurofibromas in the thyroid gland is extremely rare. Here we present the case of a 6-year-old male patient with NF1 who consulted at the Department of Endocrinology due to a thyroid tumor and whose ultrasound confirmed a heterogeneous mass at the posterior level of the right lobe. A cervical surgery found the tumor was adhered to the larynx and trachea, with the recurrent laryngeal nerve entering the tumor. Due to the impossibility of dissection, a right hemithyroidectomy was performed and the pathological examination confirmed the presence of plexiform neurofibroma and intrathyroidal neurofibroma. This is the second case reported in childhood and the youngest case to date. Neurofibroma with thyroid involvement should be suspected in patients with cervical mass and NF1, since diagnostic guidance allows avoiding unnecessary studies and guide treatment.","Ana Feller, Deborah De Guevara, Viviana Herzovich, Noelia Dujovne, Marta Ciaccio, Natalia Gazek",2024
Long-term quality of survival after pediatric low-grade glioma.,"Low-grade glioma is the most common brain tumor in children with different modes of treatment and a high overall survival. Low-grade glioma is considered a chronic disease, since residual tumor is present in many children. The tumor and its treatment lead to acquired brain injury with diverse consequences for later life based on factors like the diverse tumor locations, treatment(s) applied, neurofibromatosis type 1, and age at diagnosis.","Judith M de Bont, Antoinette Y N Schouten-van Meeteren",2024
"Autism Spectrum Disorder Symptom Profiles in Fragile X Syndrome, Angelman Syndrome, Tuberous Sclerosis Complex and Neurofibromatosis Type 1.","Studying Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) heterogeneity in biologically homogeneous samples may increase our knowledge of ASD etiology. Fragile X syndrome (FXS), Angelman syndrome (AS), Tuberous Sclerosis Complex (TSC), and Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) are monogenic disorders with high a prevalence of ASD symptomatology. This study aimed to identify ASD symptom profiles in a large group of children and adolescents (0;9-28 years) with FXS, AS, TSC, and NF1. Data on ASD symptomatology (Autism Diagnostic Observation Scale (ADOS-2) & Social Responsiveness Scale (SRS-2)) were collected from children and adolescents with FXS (n = 54), AS (n = 93), TSC (n = 112), and NF1 (n = 278). To identify groups of individuals with similar ASD profiles, we performed two latent profile analyses. We identified a four-profile model based on the ADOS-2, with a (1) 'Non-spectrum symptom profile', (2) 'Social Affect symptom profile', (3)'Restricted/Repetitive Behaviors symptom profile', and (4)'ASD symptom profile'. We also identified a four-profile model based on the SRS, with a (1)'Non-clinical symptom profile', (2)'Mild symptom profile', (3)'Moderate symptom profile', and (4)'Severe symptom profile'. Although each syndrome group exhibited varying degrees of severity, they also displayed heterogeneity in the profiles in which they were classified. We found distinct ASD symptom profiles in a population consisting of children and adolescents with FXS, AS, TSC, and NF1. Our study highlights the importance of a personalized approach to the identification and management of ASD symptoms in rare genetic syndromes. Future studies should aim to include more domains of functioning and investigate the stability of latent profiles over time.","Kyra Lubbers, Kamil R Hiralal, Gwendolyn C Dieleman, Doesjka A Hagenaar, Bram Dierckx, Jeroen S Legerstee, Pieter F A de Nijs, André B Rietman, Rianne Oostenbrink, Karen G C B Bindels-de Heus, Marie-Claire Y de Wit, Manon H J Hillegers, Leontine W Ten Hoopen, Sabine E Mous",2024

Genetic principles related to neurocutaneous disorders.,"A detailed understanding of genetics is critical to the diagnosis, management, and prognostication of neurocutaneous disorders. Inheritance patterns can provide a key to the identification of different neurocutaneous disorders. Autosomal dominant disorders, like neurofibromatosis type 1 and tuberous sclerosis complex, affect males and females equally and are typically seen in every generation of a pedigree due to pathogenic changes to one copy of a gene on a somatic chromosome. Autosomal recessive disorders, such as ataxia-telangiectasia, affect males and females equally but typically skip generations on pedigrees as there needs to be a pathogenic variant of the gene on each of the pair of somatic chromosomes. X-linked disorders such as incontinentia pigmenti and Fabry disease primarily affect males or affect them more severely, but in the case of incontinentia pigmenti, the condition is lethal in males and only females are noted to be affected. The pathogenic variant that is disease causing is on the X sex chromosome, of which females have two and males have one. Somatic mosaic disorders like Sturge Weber syndrome are due to pathogenic variants only in a subset of cells post-fertilization and are not present in gametes, and so are not passed on to the next generation. Conditions that are a result of germline mosaicism are usually identified as autosomal dominant conditions that have not been present in the family prior to a single child being affected, with suspicion strengthening if siblings are diagnosed with the same condition. Regardless of the suspected inheritance pattern, it is essential to consider the ethical implications of genetic testing, including family planning, discovery of consanguinity, disclosure to other potentially affected family members, and diagnostic uncertainty.","Leah Ferrante, Chelsey Ortman",2024
A Rare Case of Malignant Triton Tumor Without Associated Neurofibromatosis.,"This paper describes a rare case of malignant triton tumor (MTT), a malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor with rhabdomyoblastic differentiation, that occurred in a 21-year-old male with no concomitant clinical signs of neurofibromatosis. Although total surgical excision is ideal, the high recurrence rate and distant metastases frequently result in a poor prognosis. A biopsy, in this case, revealed spindle cells organized in short fascicles, with minor anisonucleosis and cross-striations indicating rhabdomyomatous differentiation. Positive immunohistochemistry for epithelial membrane antigen (EMA), Desmin, and S100 markers validated the diagnosis. For further treatment, the patient was referred to a cancer center. Even without clinical signs of neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF-1), the research emphasizes the need to evaluate MTTs as a differential diagnosis for individuals presenting with tumors in the head and neck area. Histopathology and immunohistochemistry are useful diagnostic techniques, and early intervention with surgical excision may enhance the outcome. The paper concludes with a review of the histological criteria needed to establish the diagnosis of MTT and the distinctions between sporadic and NF-1-associated tumors.","Hriday Shah, Prutha Tailor, Khushbu Shah, Twinkle Shah",2024
Case report: MEK inhibitor as treatment for multi-lineage mosaic KRAS G12D-associated epidermal nevus syndrome in a pediatric patient.,"The RASopathies, collectively, are a spectrum of genetic syndromes caused by mutations in genes involved in the RAS/ mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway, including but not limited to <i>PTPN11</i>, <i>NRAS</i>, <i>KRAS</i>, <i>HRAS</i>, <i>BRAF</i>, and <i>MAP2K1</i>. Recognized RASopathy conditions include neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1), Noonan syndrome, capillary malformation-arteriovenous malformation syndrome, Costello syndrome, cardiofacio-cutaneous (CFC) syndrome, LEOPARD syndrome and Legius syndrome. The RASopathies often display overlapping clinical features, presumably owing to common RAS-MAPK signaling pathway activation driving dysregulated cell proliferation. Epidermal nevus syndromes (ENS) are described as the presence of epidermal nevi, in individuals also affected by extra-cutaneous organ system involvement, and there is recent recognition of mosaic RAS mutations as molecular drivers of ENS. Currently, no curative treatments exist for RASopathy driven conditions, but rather symptom-directed management is the currently accepted standard. Here, we detail a unique case of a child exhibiting diffuse spinal nerve root hypertrophy in the context of epidermal nevus syndrome driven by molecularly confirmed <i>KRAS G12D</i> mosaicism, treated with the MEK 1/2 inhibitor selumetinib. Herein, we report the response of this patient to targeted therapy of more than two years' duration, including stabilization of multilevel nerve root hypertrophy as well as significant improvement in epidermal nevi. While the effectiveness of MEK inhibitors such as selumetinib is established in <i>NF1</i>-associated inoperable plexiform neurofibromas, their use in managing hyperactive <i>KRAS</i>-driven epidermal nevi and hypertrophic neuropathy remains unproven, and this case, to our knowledge, is the first such case to be reported. Shared molecular dysregulation and overlapping clinical features between these conditions suggest potential for effective therapeutic application of MEK directed therapy to address a range of conditions resulting from germline and/ or mosaic expression of aberrantly regulated RAS signaling.","Margarita Dionysiou, Stavriani C Makri, Shivani Ahlawat, Melike Guryildirim, Kristin W Barañano, Mari L Groves, Pedram Argani, Christine A Pratilas",2024

Defining the radiological characteristics that distinguish non-neoplastic from neoplastic T2Hs in children with NF1 is crucial. Then, we could identify lesions that most likely to require oncologic surveillance.","Yong Han, Hangzhou Wang, Yulun Huang",2024
