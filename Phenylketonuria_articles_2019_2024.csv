A Rare Combination of Compound Heterozygous Mutations in the <i>PAH</i> Gene in Three Unrelated Consanguineous Iranian Families with Classical Phenylketonuria.,"The <i>PAH</i> gene mutations have been linked to the development of phenylketonuria (PKU), which is recognized as the most common inborn metabolic disorder, and is caused by a deficiency in the phenylalanine hydroxylase (<i>PAH</i>) enzyme. The Iranian population, known for its diversity and high consanguinity, offers a valuable sample for studying autosomal recessive disorders. Our study investigated three unrelated families with PKU from Iran, utilizing clinical, laboratory, and computational approaches.","Arian Rahimzadeh, Teymoor Khosravi, Farzaneh Motallebi, Zainab M Al Sudani, Fatemeh Vaghefi, Ali Kowsari, Morteza Oladnabi",2024
Nutrition in Phenylketonuria.,"Phenylketonuria (PKU) is a genetic metabolic disease resulting from a deficiency in the enzyme phenylalanine hydroxylase. This defect prevents the conversion of phenylalanine to tyrosine, and as a result, the level of phenylalanine in the body increases abnormally. The accumulation of this amino acid may cause brain damage and grows development in these patients. The primary approach to treating the disease involves dietary management that restricts protein and phenylalanine intake, often alongside Tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4) supplementation. Medical foods specifically formulated for these patients are utilized to supply the necessary energy, protein, and tyrosine. Other treatment options, including the use of large neutral amino acids (LNAAs) and the enzyme Phenylalanine ammonia lyase (PAL), can be utilized to manage symptoms in adult patients. Advancements in gene therapy aimed at correcting defective genes in patients may help restore phenylalanine metabolism, though further research in this area is necessary. Effective personal management of phenylketonuria necessitates enhanced knowledge and collaboration among healthcare professionals to achieve optimal treatment outcomes for patients. This article emphasis the nutritional management of individuals with phenylketonuria across various stages of their lives.","Saeedeh Talebi, Peyman Eshraghi",2024
Acceptability of dried blood spot collection by primary caregivers of Filipino patients with maple syrup urine disease (MSUD) and phenylketonuria (PKU).,"MSUD and PKU require lifetime management hence, regular monitoring of amino acid levels is needed to achieve good metabolic control. Ideally, plasma amino acid analysis (PLAA) is used to monitor concentrations but is expensive and not widely available in local laboratories. The newborn screening program in the Philippines uses dried blood spot (DBS) analysis as an alternative where only trained healthcare providers are allowed to perform the collection at selected facilities. With the increasing number of patients, DBS monitoring has been noted to be delayed due to multiple factors. This issue became even more evident during the COVID-19 pandemic where high-risk patients need to travel outside for blood collection. The study used a cross-sectional study design to determine the primary caregivers' perspective on DBS self-sampling for patients with MSUD and PKU and the acceptability of the samples collected. This was done through a series of collection training, pre-/post- surveys, and 10-item questionnaire, and an in-depth 1-on-1 interview for thematic analysis. The acceptability of samples was processed and evaluated by the newborn screening laboratory. At-home DBS collection by primary caregivers was found to be acceptable. The provision of knowledge and routine collection training by the medical team aids in the increase of sample acceptability as well as a source of empowerment in being equipped to take care of their child. It is highly recommended that DBS samples collected by caregivers be considered acceptable for more time and cost-saving monitoring of the patients' metabolites. This practice also promotes timely and appropriate management which can lead to better patient health outcomes.","Roxanne Janica E Merencilla, Ebner Bon G Maceda, Jeanne Ruth U Basas, Rufus Thomas Y Adducul, Ma Lourdes Francisco, Justin Von Licudo, Leniza G de Castro-Hamoy",2024
Protein requirements in adults with phenylketonuria and bioavailability of glycomacropeptide compared to an l-amino acid-based product.,"Phenylketonuria (PKU) is caused by phenylalanine hydroxylase deficiency. Treatment is primarily a low-Phe diet combined with l-amino acid-based products (l-AA). Protein requirements in adults with PKU have not been directly determined. A formula with glycomacropeptide (GMP) and low phenylalanine is available, yet untested for optimal protein synthesis.","Abrar Turki, Sylvia Stockler-Ipsiroglu, Sandra Sirrs, Jennifer Branov, Taryn Bosdet, Rajavel Elango",2024
Evaluation of Body Composition and Biochemical Parameters in Adult Phenylketonuria.,"Phenylketonuria is a hereditary metabolic disorder characterized by a deficiency of phenylalanine hydroxylase. The main treatment for PKU is a phenylalanine-restricted diet. The exclusion of protein rich natural foods and inclusion of low-Phe substitutes may give rise to an imbalanced diet, and the increased risk of overweight and obesity in PKU is a cause for concern. We aimed to evaluate the body composition and nutritional biochemical biomarkers in adult PKU patients who are on Phe-restricted and essential amino acid-supplemented nutrition therapy and to investigate the relationships between these parameters and patient gender, adherence to dietary therapy, and disease type, defined as mild or classic PKU.","Mehmet Cihan Balci, Meryem Karaca, Dilek Gunes, Huseyin Kutay Korbeyli, Arzu Selamioglu, Gulden Gokcay",2024
Nutritional Counseling Promotes Adherence to the Mediterranean Diet and Healthy Eating in Italian Patients Affected by Phenylketonuria and Treated with Pegvaliase.,"Pegvaliase, a subcutaneous therapy to treat phenylketonuria (PKU), has allowed these patients to maintain adequate phenylalanine (Phe) blood values without following a Phe-controlled diet; this brings up the challenge of promoting healthy eating while moving away from prescription diets. In our center, every patient treated with Pegvaliase undergoes routine nutritional counseling aimed at promoting adherence to the Mediterranean diet (MedDiet) during regular inpatient visits. This study aims to assess adherence to MedDiet and the adequacy of the diets of patients treated with Pegvaliase regarding micro- and macronutrients.","Michele Stecchi, Alice Rossi, Michelle Santoni, Francesca Bandini, Lucia Brodosi",2024
"7,8‑dihydroxyflavone reduces lipid peroxidation, proinflammatory cytokines, and mediators in chemically induced‑phenylketonuria model.","Phenylketonuria (PKU) stems from a rare genetic metabolic imbalance attributed to an insufficiency in the enzyme phenylalanine hydroxylase. Within the context of PKU, brain‑derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) plays a pivotal role in brain function. 7,8‑dihydroxyflavone (7,8‑DHF) operates as a tropomyosin receptor kinase B (TrkB) agonist, mimicking the effects of BDNF. This study aimed to examine the effects of administering 7,8‑DHF in chemically‑induced rat models specifically induced to simulate PKU chemically. The rats were subcutaneously injected with phenylalanine and p‑chlorophenylalanine, a phenylalanine hydroxylase inhibitor, along with 7,8‑DHF. The injections began on the 2nd day after birth and continued until the 10th day. Levels of interleukin‑1β (IL‑1β), interleukin‑6 (IL‑6), interleukin‑33 (IL‑33), BDNF, malondialdehyde (MDA), monoamine oxidase (MAO), and superoxide dismutase (SOD) in the brain tissues were quantified using the enzyme‑linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Reverse transcription‑quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT‑qPCR) was performed to assess the gene expressions of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), nuclear factor kappa beta (NF‑κB), caspase‑3, nuclear factor erythroid 2‑related factor 2 (Nrf2), heme oxygenase‑1 (HO‑1), and BDNF. The results showed a decrease in mRNA levels of iNOS, IL‑1β, IL‑6, and lipid peroxidation in the group that received 7,8‑DHF. These results indicate that administering 7,8‑DHF has the potential to reduce brain damage in PKU by lowering proinflammatory cytokine levels and lipid peroxidation in PKU models. Thus, 7,8‑DHF, as a small molecule, might offer a promising adjunct therapeutic approach for PKU.","Cigdem Cicek, Pelin Telkoparan-Akillilar",2024
Pegvaliase treatment normalizes blood neurotransmitter metabolites in adults with phenylketonuria.,"Phenylketonuria (PKU) is caused by deficient activity of phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH), the enzyme that converts phenylalanine (Phe) to tyrosine (Tyr), leading to a toxic accumulation of Phe and reduced Tyr in the blood and brain. Abnormal Phe and Tyr levels in the brain disrupt normal neurotransmitter biosynthesis and may contribute to the cognitive and psychiatric deficits observed in individuals with PKU. Blood neurotransmitter metabolites (NTMs) may serve as biomarkers that reflect neurotransmitter levels in the brain. In this study, blood NTMs correlated with brain NTMs and neurotransmitters in wild-type and PAH-deficient mice treated with PAH gene therapy. Pegvaliase is an enzyme substitution therapy that lowers blood Phe levels and is approved for individuals with PKU and uncontrolled blood Phe concentrations (>600 μmol/L) despite prior management. The current work evaluated the relationship between blood NTMs and blood Phe in pegvaliase-treated, Phase 3, PRISM-1 (NCT01819727) and PRISM-2 (NCT01889862) study participants (Pegvaliase Group; N = 109). At baseline, individuals in the Pegvaliase Group had lower levels of the NTMs homovanillic acid (HVA), 3-methoxy-4-hydroxyphenyl glycol (MOPEG), and 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5HIAA), and higher levels of the NTM phenylacetylglutamine (PAG) than age- and sex-matched healthy controls. PAG levels correlated positively with Phe levels (r = 0.833; p < 0.001), while HVA, MOPEG, and 5HIAA levels correlated negatively with Phe levels (r = -0.588, -0.561, and -0.857, respectively; all p < 0.001) across all timepoints. In participants with longitudinal NTM measurements available at baseline, 12 months, and 24 months (Pegvaliase Subgroup; n = 91), blood NTM levels improved from baseline with pegvaliase treatment at 12 months and 24 months, and median levels were normalized with blood Phe level reductions below 360 μmol/L after 24 months of treatment with pegvaliase, including in participants with blood Phe <30 μmol/L. In conclusion, blood NTM levels correlated with blood Phe levels, and pegvaliase improved blood NTM levels in a large cohort of individuals with PKU.","Monika A Sigg, Christopher Wilson, Gillian E Clague, Huiyu Zhou, Cheng Su, Geoffrey Y Berguig",2024
Genetically humanized phenylketonuria mouse model as a testing tool for human genome editing in fertilized eggs.,"Targeted genome editing has made significant advancements; however, safety and ethical issues have not been fully elucidated, resulting in strict control of the technique. We tested genome editing tools on gametes from a genetically humanized mouse model using a phenylketonuria (PKU) mouse model to gain insights into genome editing in human embryos. The human PKU mouse model Pah<sup>hR111X</sup> mice was generated. The junctional region between exon 3 and intron 3 of Pah was replaced with a 120 bp corresponding human PAH sequence, including the pathogenic common variant c.331C > T in Pah<sup>hR111X</sup> mice. Pah<sup>hR111X</sup> mice successfully recapitulated the PKU phenotype and showed cognitive dysfunction and depressive-like behavior, which are observed in human patients with PKU. Genome editing was applied to fertilized eggs of Pah<sup>hR111X</sup> mice utilizing sgRNA that targets the human sequence. Mice with the corrected allele exhibited normal serum phenylalanine levels. Through genome editing, we validated the utility of sgRNA. The genetically humanized mouse model suggested that germ-line genome editing of the pathogenic variant may be feasible for monogenic disorders by revealing the recovery of the phenotype; however, there are remaining issues with the tool, including its efficiency and accuracy. This genome editing protocol using a genetically humanized mouse model will provide insights for improving current issues and contribute to the establishment of heritable human genome editing protocols.","Atsumi Tsuji-Hosokawa, Iku Tsuchiya, Kie Shimizu, Miho Terao, Mito Yasuhara, Natsuho Miyamoto, Saki Kikuchi, Yuya Ogawa, Kazuaki Nakamura, Yoichi Matsubara, Shuji Takada",2024

Untargeted Metabolomics for Inborn Errors of Metabolism: Development and Evaluation of a Sustainable Reference Material for Correcting Inter-Batch Variability.,"Untargeted metabolomics has shown promise in expanding screening and diagnostic capabilities for inborn errors of metabolism (IEMs). However, inter-batch variability remains a major barrier to its implementation in the clinical laboratory, despite attempts to address this through normalization techniques. We have developed a sustainable, matrix-matched reference material (RM) using the iterative batch averaging method (IBAT) to correct inter-batch variability in liquid chromatography-high-resolution mass spectrometry-based untargeted metabolomics for IEM screening.","Rafael Garrett, Adam S Ptolemy, Sara Pickett, Mark D Kellogg, Roy W A Peake",2024
Effect of enzyme substitution therapy on brain magnetic resonance imaging and cognition in adults with phenylketonuria: A case series of three patients.,"Phenylketonuria, the most common inherited metabolic disease, results from a deficiency of phenylalanine hydroxylase enzyme activity that causes high blood phenylalanine levels. Most adults do not adhere to the gold standard therapy: lifelong treatment with a low-phenylalanine diet. Elevated and fluctuating phenylalanine levels in untreated adults can cause white matter abnormalities, neurological symptoms, and cognitive dysfunction (executive function). Pegvaliase, a derivative of the phenylalanine ammonia-lyase enzyme, metabolizes phenylalanine to trans-cinnamic acid and ammonia, and is approved by the US Food and Drug Administration and European Medicines Agency for subcutaneous administration in adults with phenylketonuria and blood phenylalanine concentrations > 600 μmol/L. In clinical trials, it reduced blood phenylalanine, even in patients consuming an unrestricted diet. We report longitudinal results on the first three such adults, in whom phenylalanine levels were quantified monthly, starting 1 year before pegvaliase administration and continuing through achievement of a pegvaliase response (defined as six consecutive monthly blood phenylalanine concentrations < 360 μmol/L while consuming an unrestricted diet). Brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and neuropsychological assessments were performed before starting therapy and after response was achieved. Our results show that all three patients had significantly reduced white matter hyperintensities on brain MRI and improved executive function on neuropsychological assessment, especially on the Paced Auditory Serial Addition Test, which is known to be very sensitive to white matter functioning. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of concomitant improvements in cognitive performance and white matter damage after a pharmacological intervention to normalize phenylalanine levels in adults with phenylketonuria consuming an unrestricted diet.","Alessandro P Burlina, Renzo Manara, Jessica Carretta, Chiara Cazzorla, Christian Loro, Vincenza Gragnaniello, Alberto B Burlina",2024
"Evaluation of Exposure to Bisphenol A, Bisphenol F, and Phthalates in Patients with Phenylketonuria and Its Differences According to Dietary Status.","Phenylketonuria (PKU) is the most common amino acid metabolism disorder.

Bisphenols and phthalates are widely used endocrine-disrupting chemicals (EDCs) found in personal care products, baby bottles, and food packaging.","İzzet Erdal, Yılmaz Yıldız, Sıddıka Songül Yalçın, Anıl Yirün, Göksun Demirel, Pınar Erkekoğlu",2024
Factors Affecting Adherence to a Low Phenylalanine Diet in Patients with Phenylketonuria: A Systematic Review.,"Phenylketonuria (PKU) is an inherited metabolic disorder that requires lifelong adherence to a low-phenylalanine (Phe) diet to prevent severe neurological complications. However, maintaining dietary adherence can be challenging for patients and their families. This systematic review aimed to comprehensively evaluate the factors affecting adherence to a low-Phe diet in patients with PKU. A systematic search of multiple databases was conducted, and 49 studies were included in the final analysis. The quality of evidence was assessed using the Joanna Briggs Institute levels of evidence and the Quality Assessment with Diverse Studies tool. The review identified four main categories of factors influencing dietary adherence: family-related factors (social, psychological, behavioral, and educational), patient-specific factors (psychological, behavioral, educational, and demographic), environmental factors (healthcare professional support, educational and camp-based interventions, and the COVID-19 pandemic), and therapy-related factors (protein substitute formulation, clinic visits, blood tests, and telemedicine). The findings highlight the complex interplay between elements contributing to dietary adherence in PKU patients and underscore the importance of a multifaceted approach to support patients and their families. Future research should prioritize high-quality longitudinal and experimental studies to provide stronger evidence for the PKU community.","Roza Yagudina, Andrey Kulikov, Vyacheslav Serpik, Marina Protsenko, Kirill Kopeyka",2024
Transcriptome Profiling of Phenylalanine-Treated Human Neuronal Model: Spotlight on Neurite Impairment and Synaptic Connectivity.,"Phenylketonuria (PKU) is the most common inherited disorder of amino acid metabolism, characterized by high levels of phenylalanine (Phe) in the blood and brain, leading to cognitive impairment without treatment. Nevertheless, Phe-mediated brain dysfunction is not fully understood. The objective of this study was to address gene expression alterations due to excessive Phe exposure in the human neuronal model and provide molecular advances in PKU pathophysiology. Hence, we performed NT2/D1 differentiation in culture, and, for the first time, we used Phe-treated NT2-derived neurons (NT2/N) as a novel model for Phe-mediated neuronal impairment. NT2/N were treated with 1.25 mM, 2.5 mM, 5 mM, 10 mM, and 30 mM Phe and subjected to whole-mRNA short-read sequencing. Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were analyzed and enrichment analysis was performed. Under three different Phe concentrations (2.5 mM, 5 mM, and 10 mM), DEGs pointed to the <i>PREX1</i>, <i>LRP4</i>, <i>CDC42BPG</i>, <i>GPR50</i>, <i>PRMT8</i>, <i>RASGRF2,</i> and <i>CDH6</i> genes, placing them in the context of PKU for the first time. Enriched processes included dendrite and axon impairment, synaptic transmission, and membrane assembly. In contrast to these groups, the 30 mM Phe treatment group clearly represented the neurotoxicity of Phe, exhibiting enrichment in apoptotic pathways. In conclusion, we established NT2/N as a novel model for Phe-mediated neuronal dysfunction and outlined the Phe-induced gene expression changes resulting in neurite impairment and altered synaptic connectivity.","Sara Stankovic, Andrijana Lazic, Marina Parezanovic, Milena Stevanovic, Sonja Pavlovic, Maja Stojiljkovic, Kristel Klaassen",2024

The Multifaceted Role of L-Type Amino Acid Transporter 1 at the Blood-Brain Barrier: Structural Implications and Therapeutic Potential.,"L-type amino acid transporter 1 (LAT1) is integral to the transport of large neutral amino acids across the blood-brain barrier (BBB), playing a crucial role in brain homeostasis and the delivery of therapeutic agents. This review explores the multifaceted role of LAT1 in neurological disorders, including its structural and functional aspects at the BBB. Studies using advanced BBB models, such as induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived systems and quantitative proteomic analyses, have demonstrated LAT1's significant impact on drug permeability and transport efficiency. In Alzheimer's disease, LAT1-mediated delivery of anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective agents shows promise in overcoming BBB limitations. In Parkinson's disease, LAT1's role in transporting L-DOPA and other therapeutic agents highlights its potential in enhancing treatment efficacy. In phenylketonuria, studies have revealed polymorphisms and genetic variations of LAT1, which could be correlated to disease severity. Prodrugs of valproic acid, pregabalin, and gabapentin help use LAT1-mediated transport to increase the therapeutic activity and bioavailability of the prodrug in the brain. LAT1 has also been studied in neurodevelopment disorders like autism spectrum disorders and Rett syndrome, along with neuropsychiatric implications in depression. Its implications in neuro-oncology, especially in transporting therapeutic agents into cancer cells, show immense future potential. Phenotypes of LAT1 have also shown variations in the general population affecting their ability to respond to painkillers and anti-inflammatory drugs. Furthermore, LAT1-targeted approaches, such as functionalized nanoparticles and prodrugs, show promise in overcoming chemoresistance and enhancing drug delivery to the brain. The ongoing exploration of LAT1's structural characteristics and therapeutic applications reiterates its critical role in advancing treatments for neurological disorders.",H Shafeeq Ahmed,2024
Clinical Assessment of Breast Cancer Resistance Protein (BCRP)-Mediated Drug-Drug Interactions of Sepiapterin with Curcumin and Rosuvastatin in Healthy Volunteers.,"Sepiapterin, also known as PTC923 and CNSA-001, is a synthetic form of endogenous sepiapterin being developed as a novel oral treatment for phenylketonuria. Sepiapterin is a natural precursor of tetrahydrobiopterin (BH<sub>4</sub>) and, when orally administered, is converted to BH<sub>4</sub> via the pterin salvage pathway. In vitro studies have demonstrated that both sepiapterin and BH<sub>4</sub> are both substrates and inhibitors of the breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP) transporter. This phase I study investigated BCRP-mediated drug-drug interactions of sepiapterin as a victim and as a perpetrator.","Lan Gao, Diksha Kaushik, Kimberly Ingalls, Sarah Milner, Neil Smith, Ronald Kong",2024
Treating the whole patient: Facilitating health care for patients facing health inequity.,"Social determinants of health (SDOH) are conditions in which people are born, grow, live, work, and age. Variations in these conditions are largely responsible for health inequities, the differences in health status or distribution of health resources within a population. Despite recent increases in attention to SDOH in research and clinical practice, few, if any, resources exist to describe how these complex dynamics impact patients with inborn errors of metabolism. Recognizing the role real-life narratives have as a powerful educational tool, we compiled a series of 3 original cases, published as part of this special supplement, to illustrate challenges and learnings related to SDOH within the context of urea cycle disorders and phenylketonuria.","Amarilis Sanchez-Valle, Corey Hicks",2024
Navigating social determinants of health barriers in the management of phenylketonuria.,"Phenylketonuria (PKU) is an inborn error of amino acid metabolism that is typically identified by newborn screening. With lifelong treatment consisting of dietary management, frequent laboratory monitoring, and regular metabolic clinic visits, patients with PKU can maintain good health and metabolic control. Here, we describe the case of an 8-year-old patient with PKU who has been followed by a metabolic clinic since birth. Despite responsiveness to sapropterin, this patient has had periods of poor metabolic control throughout her life due to her family's economic hardships, including limited access to transportation, housing, food, and health insurance. This case illustrates how social determinants of health may negatively affect rare disease management and potential strategies for addressing barriers to care.","Ashley Andrews, Kate McMinimee",2024
Evaluating the Influence of Social Determinants of Health on Blood Phenylalanine Levels in Phenylketonuria Patients.,"Phenylketonuria (PKU) is a genetic metabolic disorder that causes the accumulation of phenylalanine (Phe) in tissues, leading to intellectual disability, seizures, and socioemotional challenges. The role of social determinants of health (SDOH) in PKU management has not been formally studied, and this investigation evaluates the association between in-home and in-office factors on blood Phe levels in PKU patients. We conducted a retrospective chart review on over 200 patients attending the well-resourced PKU Clinic at Lurie Children's Hospital of Chicago. Data included patients' average Phe level, various demographic information, and CDC/ATSDR social vulnerability index (SVI) score. The analysis revealed no significant association between social vulnerability status and average Phe level. However, a significant correlation was found between sapropterin dihydrochloride use and average Phe level. Age interacted separately with sex assigned at birth, pegvaliase use, total Phe samples submitted, and the presence of genetic testing to significantly influence the average Phe level. This study highlights the multifactorial influences on PKU management and underscores the importance of social resources, such as clinic social workers and state-provided formula, in modulating the effects of SDOH on PKU control. Further research in different healthcare settings is needed to understand the social determinants affecting PKU patients comprehensively, which will strengthen advocacy efforts for this population.","Cassandra Afseth, Josh Knutsen, Thomas Lamborn, Erika Vucko, Kirsten Havens, Soo Shim, Joshua Baker",2024
Precision phenylalanine sensing in blood with nanomaterial-enhanced electrodes.,"Phenylketonuria (PKU) is a genetic disorder associated with the metabolic dysfunction of the phenylalanine hydroxylase enzyme, which catalyses the conversion of l-phenylalanine (Phe) to l-tyrosine. Elevated levels of phenylalanine disrupt the central nervous system by impairing the myelination process and leading to mental retardation. Currently, commonly used diagnostic methods for PKU include the Guthrie test, liquid chromatography, and tandem mass spectrometry, all of which necessitate sophisticated infrastructure and costly equipment. Conversely, electrochemical detection methods hold promise in clinical diagnosis due to their high accuracy, rapid response time, and user-friendly nature. The choice of electrodes in electrochemical methods significantly influences sensitivity and analytical performance. In this study, we evaluated the performance of various nanomaterial-modified electrodes and compared their responses to the redox reaction of phenylalanine, focusing on detection capabilities in blood samples. Specifically, we examined carbon nanotube-gold nanoparticle modified carbon electrode (C-CNT-GNP), graphene-gold nanoparticle modified carbon electrode (C-GPH-GNP), electrochemically reduced graphene oxide (ERGO) modified carbon electrode (C-ERGO), bare carbon electrode (C-BARE), ERGO modified gold electrode (Au-ERGO), and bare gold electrode (Au-BARE) using amperometric detection. The performance of these electrodes was compared in terms of their limit of detection (LOD), limit of quantification (LOQ), and sensitivity. Among all electrodes, ERGO gold electrode showed the lowest LOD, LOQ, and highest sensitivity. This study highlights the potential of ERGO-modified gold electrodes for enhancing electrocatalytic activity, thus offering promising prospects for further diagnostic applications.","Ipek Akyilmaz, Naim Yagiz Demir, Deniz Bas, Memed Duman",2024
Probing assembly/disassembly of ordered molecular hydrogels.,"Supramolecular hydrogels have a wide range of applications in the biomedical field, acting as scaffolds for cell culture, matrices for tissue engineering and vehicles for drug delivery. L-Phenylalanine (Phe) is a natural amino acid that plays a significant role in several physiological and pathophysiological processes (phenylketonuria and assembly of fibrils linked to tissue damage). Since Myerson <i>et al.</i> [<i>Chem. Eng. Commun.</i>, 2002, <b>189</b>(8), 1079-1090] reported that Phe forms a fibrous network <i>in vitro</i>, Phe's self-assembly processes in water have been thoroughly investigated. We have reported structural control over gelation by introduction of a halogen atom in the aromatic ring of Phe, driving changes in the packing motifs, and therefore, dictating gelation functionality. The additional level of control gained over supramolecular gelation <i>via</i> the preparation of multi-component gel systems offers significant advantages in tuning functional properties of such materials. Gaining molecular-level information on the distribution of gelators between the inherent structural and dynamic heterogeneities of these materials remains a considerable challenge. Using multicomponent gels based on Phe and amino-L-phenylalanine (NH<sub>2</sub>-Phe), we will explore the patterns of ordered/disordered domains in the gel fibres and will attempt to come up with general trends of interactions in the gel fibres and at the fibre/solution interfaces. Phe and NH<sub>2</sub>-Phe were found to self-assemble in water into crystalline hydrogels. The determined faster dynamics of exchange between the gel and solution states of NH<sub>2</sub>-Phe in comparison with Phe were correlated with weaker intermolecular interactions, highlighting the role of head groups in dictating the strength of intermolecular interactions. In the mixed Phe/NH<sub>2</sub>-Phe systems, at a low concentration of NH<sub>2</sub>-Phe, disruption of the network was promoted by interference of the aliphatics of NH<sub>2</sub>-Phe with the electrostatic interactions between Phe molecules. At high concentrations of NH<sub>2</sub>-Phe, multiple-gelator hydrogels were formed with crystal habits different from those of the pure gel fibres. NMR crystallography approaches combining the strengths of solid- and solution-state NMR proved particularly suitable to obtain structural and dynamic insights into the ""ordered"" fibres, solution phase and fibre/solution interfaces in these gels. These findings are supported by a plethora of experimental (diffraction, rheology, microscopy and thermal analysis) and computational methods.","Susana M Ramalhete, Karol P Nartowski, Hayley Green, Jesús Angulo, Dinu Iuga, László Fábián, Gareth O Lloyd, Yaroslav Z Khimyak",2024

We present narratives by people living with PKU during these years, including individuals actively following in PKU clinic and those who have been out of PKU clinic for many years. These stories describe different individual experiences, including diet discontinuation in childhood, changing treatment guidelines, and new treatments that have become available.","Brittany M Holmes, Suzanne Hollander, Stephanie Sacharow",2024
Understanding the Effect of Ionic Liquid-Mediated Solvent Engineering on the Kinetics and Thermodynamic Stability of Phenylalanine Ammonia-Lyase.,"Phenylalanine ammonia-lyase (PAL) plays a central role in the phenylpropanoid pathway and in the treatment of phenylketonuria. However, the integration of PAL into sustainable industrial biocatalysis is hampered by its instability under harsh conditions. This study demonstrates that ionic liquid (IL)-assisted solvent (Tris-HCl buffer) engineering enables improvement of the reaction kinetics and thermodynamic stability of <i>Rhodotorula glutinis</i>PAL (<i>Rg</i>PAL) under various stresses. Under optimized conditions, a 66.2% higher K<sub>cat</sub> value, >60% remaining activity after 5 weeks of storage at room temperature, and >80% activity of <i>Rg</i>PAL after incubation at 60 °C for 1 h were obtained in the [Ch][Ac]-blended Tris-HCl solvent compared to pristine Tris-HCl. The spectroscopic and molecular docking results suggest that the higher extent of hydration and the soft interactions complemented by the ILs with the D-chain residues of <i>Rg</i>PAL jointly contributed to achieving more stable and active conformations of <i>Rg</i>PAL. The enzyme showed a higher melting temperature (<i>T</i><sub>m</sub>) in ILs+Tris-HCl compared to that in pristine Tris-HCl, with less change in enthalpy (Δ<i>H</i><sub>fu</sub>) and entropy (Δ<i>S</i><sub>fu</sub>) of unfolding. Overall, IL-mediated solvent engineering alters the microenvironment of <i>Rg</i>PAL and allows the development of a robust PAL-based biocatalytic system.","Pranav Bharadwaj, Avishak Barua, Meena Bisht, Dheeraj Kumar Sarkar, Sagar Biswas, Gregory Franklin, Dibyendu Mondal",2024
Longitudinal Dietary Intake Data in Patients with Phenylketonuria from Europe: The Impact of Age and Phenylketonuria Severity.,"In phenylketonuria (PKU), natural protein intake is thought to increase with age, particularly during childhood and adolescence. Longitudinal dietary intake data are scarce and lifelong phenylalanine tolerance remains unknown. Nine centres managing PKU in Europe and Turkey participated in a retrospective study. Data were collected from dietetic records between 2012 and 2018 on phenylalanine (Phe), natural protein, and protein substitute intake. A total of 1323 patients (age range: 1-57 y; 51% male) participated. Dietary intake data were available on 1163 (88%) patients. Patient numbers ranged from 59 to 320 in each centre. A total of 625 (47%) had classical PKU (cPKU), <i>n</i> = 357 (27%) had mild PKU (mPKU), <i>n</i> = 325 (25%) had hyperphenylalaninemia (HPA), and <i>n</i> = 16 (1%) were unknown. The mean percentage of blood Phe levels within target ranged from 65 ± 54% to 88 ± 49%. When intake was expressed as g/day, the mean Phe/natural protein and protein equivalent from protein substitute gradually increased during childhood, reaching a peak in adolescence, and then remained consistent during adulthood. When intake was expressed per kg body weight (g/kg/day), there was a decline in Phe/natural protein, protein equivalent from protein substitute, and total protein with increasing age. Overall, the mean daily intake (kg/day) was as follows: Phe, 904 mg ± 761 (22 ± 23 mg/kg/day), natural protein 19 g ± 16 (0.5 g/kg/day ± 0.5), protein equivalent from protein substitute 39 g ± 22 (1.1 g/kg/day ± 0.6), and total protein 59 g ± 21 (1.7 g/kg/day ± 0.6). Natural protein tolerance was similar between males and females. Patients with mPKU tolerated around 50% less Phe/natural protein than HPA, but 50% more than cPKU. Higher intakes of natural protein were observed in Southern Europe, with a higher prevalence of HPA and mPKU compared with patients from Northern European centres. Natural protein intake doubled with sapropterin usage. In sapropterin-responsive patients, 31% no longer used protein substitutes. Close monitoring and optimisation of protein intake prescriptions are needed, along with future guidelines specifically for different age groups and severities.","Alex Pinto, Kirsten Ahring, Manuela Ferreira Almeida, Catherine Ashmore, Amaya Bélanger-Quintana, Alberto Burlina, Turgay Coşkun, Anne Daly, Esther van Dam, Ali Dursun, Sharon Evans, François Feillet, Maria Giżewska, Hulya Gökmen-Özel, Mary Hickson, Yteke Hoekstra, Fatma Ilgaz, Richard Jackson, Alicja Leśniak, Christian Loro, Katarzyna Malicka, Michał Patalan, Júlio César Rocha, Serap Sivri, Iris Rodenburg, Francjan van Spronsen, Kamilla Strączek, Ayşegül Tokatli, Anita MacDonald",2024
"Determination of the Protein and Amino Acid Content of Fruit, Vegetables and Starchy Roots for Use in Inherited Metabolic Disorders.","Amino acid (AA)-related inherited metabolic disorders (IMDs) and urea cycle disorders (UCDs) require strict dietary management including foods low in protein such as fruits, vegetables and starchy roots. Despite this recommendation, there are limited data on the AA content of many of these foods. The aim of this study is to describe an analysis of the protein and AA content of a range of fruits, vegetables and starchy roots, specifically focusing on amino acids (AAs) relevant to AA-related IMDs such as phenylalanine (Phe), methionine (Met), leucine (Leu), lysine (Lys) and tyrosine (Tyr). AA analysis was performed using high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) on 165 food samples. Protein analysis was also carried out using the Dumas method. Foods were classified as either 'Fruits', 'Dried fruits', 'Cruciferous vegetables', 'Legumes', 'Other vegetables' or 'Starchy roots'. 'Dried fruits' and 'Legumes' had the highest median values of protein, while 'Fruits' and 'Cruciferous vegetables' contained the lowest median results. 'Legumes' contained the highest and 'Fruits' had the lowest median values for all five AAs. Variations were seen in AA content for individual foods. The results presented in this study provide useful data on the protein and AA content of fruits, vegetables and starchy roots which can be used in clinical practice. This further expansion of the current literature will help to improve diet quality and metabolic control among individuals with AA-related IMDs and UCDs.","Fiona Boyle, Gary Lynch, Clare M Reynolds, Adam Green, Gemma Parr, Caoimhe Howard, Ina Knerr, Jane Rice",2024
