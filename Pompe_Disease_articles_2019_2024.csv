"First-in-Human Evaluation of Safety, Pharmacokinetics and Muscle Glycogen Lowering of a Novel Glycogen Synthase 1 Inhibitor for the Treatment of Pompe Disease.","Pompe disease is a rare glycogen storage disease caused by mutations in the enzyme acid α-glucosidase (GAA) resulting in pathological accumulation of glycogen in muscle tissues leading to progressive weakness and respiratory dysfunction. Enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) with GAA is currently the sole treatment option for patients with Pompe disease. ERT burdens patients with frequent intravenous infusions while insufficiently halting disease progression due to incomplete ERT skeletal muscle distribution. Glycogen synthase 1 (GYS1) has been proposed as a substrate reduction therapy (SRT) target for Pompe disease. Here, we report results from the first-in-human study of the orally available GYS1 inhibitor MZE001 in healthy subjects. In 88 participants, MZE001 was well-tolerated up to a single dose of 480 mg BID and multiple doses of 720 mg BID for 10 days. Noncompartmental analysis determined that the half-life and C<sub>trough</sub> concentrations of MZE001 could provide efficacious exposures with once or twice daily oral dosing. Change from baseline of peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) glycogen, which correlated with muscle glycogen levels in preclinical models, was significantly reduced dose-dependently following 10 days of MZE001 treatment in healthy subjects. A muscle biopsy sub-study demonstrated that 10 days of MZE001 (480 mg BID) dosing safely and substantially lowered muscle glycogen stores in healthy adults. This correlated with the PBMC exposure response and supports the use of PBMC glycogen reduction as a surrogate for muscle response, and MZE001 potential for development as the first oral substrate reduction therapy for patients with Pompe disease.","Julie C Ullman, Ryan A Dick, Daniela Linzner, Todd Minga, Samnang Tep, Terrence F Satterfield, Yannan Xi, David T Beattie, Tonya Marmon, Joel M Neutel, Bernard Chung, Janet M Leeds, Sarah B Noonberg, Eric M Green, Harold S Bernstein",2024
Global birth prevalence of Pompe disease: A systematic review and meta-analysis.,"Pompe disease, also known as Glycogen storage disease type II, is an autosomal recessive disorder caused by defects in alpha-glucosidase, resulting in abnormal glycogen accumulation.","Weijing Kong, Cheng Lu, Lichao Wang",2024
Pompe disease: Unmet needs and emerging therapies.,"Pompe disease is a debilitating and life-threatening disease caused by aberrant accumulation of glycogen resulting from reduced acid alpha-glucosidase activity. The first treatment for Pompe disease, the enzyme replacement therapy, Myozyme® (recombinant human acid alpha-glucosidase, alglucosidase alfa), is a lifesaving treatment for the most severe form of the disease and provided clinically meaningful benefits to patients with milder phenotypes. Nonetheless, many patients display suboptimal responses or clinical decline following years of alglucosidase alfa treatment. The approval of avalglucosidase alfa (Nexviazyme®) and cipaglucosidase alfa (Pombiliti®) with miglustat (Opfolda®) represents a new generation of enzyme replacement therapies seeking to further improve patient outcomes beyond alglucosidase alfa. However, the emergence of a complicated new phenotype with central nervous system involvement following long-term treatment, coupled with known and anticipated unmet needs of patients receiving enzyme replacement therapy, has prompted development of innovative new treatments. This review provides an overview of the challenges of existing treatments and a summary of emerging therapies currently in preclinical or clinical development for Pompe disease and related lysosomal storage disorders. Key treatments include tissue-targeted enzyme replacement therapy, which seeks to enhance enzyme concentration in target tissues such as the central nervous system; substrate reduction therapy, which reduces intracellular glycogen concentrations via novel mechanisms; and gene therapy, which may restore endogenous production of deficient acid alpha-glucosidase. Each of these proposed treatments shows promise as a future therapeutic option to improve quality of life in Pompe disease by more efficiently treating the underlying cause of disease progression: glycogen accumulation.","Kelly A George, Allyson L Anding, Arjan van der Flier, Giulio S Tomassy, Kenneth I Berger, Tracy Y Zhang, S Pablo Sardi",2024

Significance of early diagnosis and treatment of adult late-onset Pompe disease on the effectiveness of enzyme replacement therapy in improving muscle strength and respiratory function: a case report.,"Pompe disease, a rare autosomal recessive disorder, is caused by mutations in the acid α-glucosidase gene. Pompe disease is a congenital metabolic disorder that affects all organs, particularly the striated muscle and nerve cells. Diagnosis is typically confirmed through enzyme assays that reveal reduced acid α-glucosidase activity. Enzyme replacement therapy utilizing human α-glucosidase is an available treatment option. Timely diagnosis and treatment in the early stages of the disease significantly impact the effectiveness of enzyme replacement therapy in enhancing patient condition. Here, we present a case of a patient with Pompe disease diagnosed 20 years after the onset of clinical symptoms.","Moein Mir, Kianmehr Rouhani, Kiana Rouhani, Mohammadjavad Hassani, Mohammadrafi Damirchi, Sajjad Yazdansetad, Mehrdad Aghaei",2024

Living with Pompe disease: results from a qualitative interview study with children and adolescents and their caregivers.,"Children and adolescents with Pompe disease (PD) face chronic and progressive myopathy requiring time-intensive enzyme replacement therapy (ERT). Little is known about their perspectives on the disease and its treatment. This study explored their perceptions of disease symptoms and functioning status, and more subjective feelings about the impacts on their lives as part of developing a disease-specific questionnaire.","Moritz Ilan Truninger, Helene Werner, Markus Andreas Landolt, Andreas Hahn, Julia B Hennermann, Florian B Lagler, Dorothea Möslinger, Charlotte Pfrimmer, Marianne Rohrbach, Martina Huemer",2024
Mitochondrial Dysfunction in Glycogen Storage Disorders (GSDs).,"Glycogen storage disorders (GSDs) are a group of inherited metabolic disorders characterized by defects in enzymes involved in glycogen metabolism. Deficiencies in enzymes responsible for glycogen breakdown and synthesis can impair mitochondrial function. For instance, in GSD type II (Pompe disease), acid alpha-glucosidase deficiency leads to lysosomal glycogen accumulation, which secondarily impacts mitochondrial function through dysfunctional mitophagy, which disrupts mitochondrial quality control, generating oxidative stress. In GSD type III (Cori disease), the lack of the debranching enzyme causes glycogen accumulation and affects mitochondrial dynamics and biogenesis by disrupting the integrity of muscle fibers. Malfunctional glycogen metabolism can disrupt various cascades, thus causing mitochondrial and cell metabolic dysfunction through various mechanisms. These dysfunctions include altered mitochondrial morphology, impaired oxidative phosphorylation, increased production of reactive oxygen species (ROS), and defective mitophagy. The oxidative burden typical of GSDs compromises mitochondrial integrity and exacerbates the metabolic derangements observed in GSDs. The intertwining of mitochondrial dysfunction and GSDs underscores the complexity of these disorders and has significant clinical implications. GSD patients often present with multisystem manifestations, including hepatomegaly, hypoglycemia, and muscle weakness, which can be exacerbated by mitochondrial impairment. Moreover, mitochondrial dysfunction may contribute to the progression of GSD-related complications, such as cardiomyopathy and neurocognitive deficits. Targeting mitochondrial dysfunction thus represents a promising therapeutic avenue in GSDs. Potential strategies include antioxidants to mitigate oxidative stress, compounds that enhance mitochondrial biogenesis, and gene therapy to correct the underlying mitochondrial enzyme deficiencies. Mitochondrial dysfunction plays a critical role in the pathophysiology of GSDs. Recognizing and addressing this aspect can lead to more comprehensive and effective treatments, improving the quality of life of GSD patients. This review aims to elaborate on the intricate relationship between mitochondrial dysfunction and various types of GSDs. The review presents challenges and treatment options for several GSDs.","Kumudesh Mishra, Or Kakhlon",2024
Lysosomal storage diseases.,"Lysosomal storage disorders (LSDs) are a group of inherited metabolic diseases caused by dysfunction of the lysosomal system, with subsequent progressive accumulation of macromolecules, activation of inflammatory response, and cell death. Neurologic damage is almost always present, and it is usually degenerative. White matter (WM) involvement may be primary or secondary. Diseases with primary WM involvement are leukodystrophies, demyelinating (Krabbe disease and metachromatic leukodystrophy), and hypomyelinating leukodystrophies (free sialic acid storage disease, fucosidosis, and mucolipidosis type IV). LSDs with secondary WM involvement are classified as leukoencephalopathies and include gangliosidosis, mucopolysaccharidosis (MPS), ceroid neuronal lipofuscinosis, multiple sulfatase deficiency, alpha-mannosidosis, Pompe disease, and Fabry disease. Neurologic manifestations may overlap among LSDs and include developmental delays, motor, cognitive and speech impairments, seizures, visual failure, ataxia, and extrapyramidal signs. Most of LSDs are typically present in early or late infancy, but juvenile and adult forms also exist and are associated with predominantly neuropsychiatric and behavioral symptoms. The outcome of these disorders is generally poor and specific treatments (enzyme replacement therapy, hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, or gene therapy) are only available in a small number of them.","Alessandro P Burlina, Renzo Manara, Daniela Gueraldi",2024
Health-Related Quality-of-Life Utility Values in Adults With Late-Onset Pompe Disease: Analyses of EQ-5D Data From the PROPEL Clinical Trial.,"<b>Background:</b> Pompe disease is a rare lysosomal storage disorder, leading to accumulation of glycogen characterized by muscle weakness, fatigue, pain, and, in the longer term, a requirement for ventilatory and ambulatory support, and early mortality if untreated. Clinical evidence suggests that enzyme replacement therapy improves health outcomes for adults with late-onset Pompe disease (LOPD). PROPEL was a Phase 3, double-blind, randomized controlled trial, which evaluated cipaglucosidase alfa plus miglustat, vs alglucosidase alfa plus placebo in 123 adult patients with LOPD (clinicaltrials.gov: NCT03729362). <b>Objectives:</b> To analyze EQ-5D health-related quality of life (HRQoL) utility data from PROPEL. <b>Methods:</b> Multilevel modeling techniques (mixed regression methods) were used to analyze PROPEL EQ-5D-3L estimates and predict utility values for 7 health states previously identified in an economic evaluation for LOPD. In PROPEL, EQ-5D-5L values were assessed at screening and at weeks 12, 26, 38, and 52. EQ-5D-5L utility values were mapped to EQ-5D-3L values using the van Hout algorithm as recommended by the EuroQoL and the National Institute of Health and Care Excellence position statement at time of analysis. UK population tariffs were applied for all EQ-5D utility valuations. Utility values were predicted according to 6-minute walk distance (6MWD) and percent predicted sitting forced vital capacity. <b>Results:</b> The mixed model predicted that EQ-5D-3L utility values for patients who could walk >75 m with LOPD ranged between 0.55 and 0.67 according to patient 6MWD and respiratory function. In this analysis, patients with a 6MWD ≤75 m, consistent with a health state requiring wheelchair support in the economic analysis, had a predicted utility value of 0.49. There were few patients in PROPEL who could walk ≤75 m at any time point in the study, hence, these utility estimates should be interpreted with caution. EQ-5D-3L utility estimates from PROPEL were consistent with previously reported EQ-5D-3L values in LOPD. <b>Conclusions:</b> Overall, the results from our analysis indicate that important HRQoL losses are associated with reductions in mobility and respiratory function for patients with Pompe disease. The study provides important evidence of HRQoL utility values for patients with advanced LOPD, a population for whom published data are limited.","Alasdair MacCulloch, Alison Griffiths, Neil Johnson, Simon Shohet",2024
Optimizing clinical outcomes: The journey of twins with CRIM-negative infantile-onset Pompe disease on high-dose enzyme replacement therapy and immunomodulation.,"Infantile-onset Pompe disease (IOPD) is caused by a deficiency in the enzyme acid alpha-glucosidase (GAA). It is characterized by severe and progressive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and muscle weakness with death in the first 2 years of life if left untreated. Enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) with alglucosidase-alfa is lifesaving, but its effectiveness is influenced by the patient's cross-reactive immunologic material (CRIM) status, dose of ERT, and the development of high antibody titers, which can reduce the therapy's efficacy. The inability of CRIM-negative IOPD patients to produce native GAA exposes them to a high risk of development of anti-rhGAA IgG antibody titers, leading to treatment failure. We present the case of CRIM-negative dizygotic twins treated with high-dose alglucosidase-alfa (40 mg/kg/week), initiated at 28 days (Twin A) and 44 days (Twin B). Both twins received immune tolerance induction (ITI) with rituximab, methotrexate, and IVIG to mitigate antibody response. Initial evaluations revealed elevated left ventricular mass index (LVMI) and elevated biomarkers (urine glucose tetrasaccharide (Glc<sub>4</sub>), creatine kinase (CK), and aspartate aminotransferase (AST)) in both twins. Following treatment, cardiac function and biomarkers normalized within several months, with a slight delay in Twin B compared to Twin A, likely attributed to the later initiation of ERT. Both twins safely tolerated ITI, achieving immune tolerance with low antibody titers. At 28 months, the twins transitioned to avalglucosidase-alfa (40 mg/kg every other week (EOW)), which was well tolerated without an increase in antibody titers. At 39 months, both twins exhibited normal cardiac function, LVMI, and biomarkers. Motor skills continued to improve, though some kinematic concerns persisted. These cases underscore the importance of early, high-dose ERT combined with ITI in managing CRIM-negative IOPD. While transitioning to avalglucosidase-alfa at 40 mg/kg/EOW was beneficial and well-tolerated in our patients, further studies are needed to confirm its long-term efficacy compared to the high-dose weekly 40 mg/kg alglucosidase-alfa.","Angie H Fares, Ankit K Desai, Laura E Case, Cassie Sharon, Amy Klinepeter, Amelia Kirby, Matthew T Lisi, Rebecca L Koch, Priya S Kishnani",2024
Brain glycogen build-up measured by magnetic resonance spectroscopy in classic infantile Pompe disease.,"Classic infantile Pompe disease is caused by abnormal lysosomal glycogen accumulation in multiple tissues, including the brain due to a deficit in acid α-glucosidase. Although treatment with recombinant human acid α-glucosidase has dramatically improved survival, recombinant human acid α-glucosidase does not reach the brain, and surviving classic infantile Pompe patients develop progressive cognitive deficits and white matter lesions. We investigated the feasibility of measuring non-invasively glycogen build-up and other metabolic alterations in the brain of classic infantile Pompe patients. Four classic infantile patients (8-16 years old) and 4 age-matched healthy controls were scanned on a 7 T MRI scanner. We used T<sub>2</sub>-weighted MRI to assess the presence of white matter lesions as well as <sup>1</sup>H magnetic resonance spectroscopy and magnetic resonance spectroscopy imaging to obtain the neurochemical profile and its spatial distribution, respectively. All patients had widespread white matter lesions on T<sub>2</sub>-weighted images. Magnetic resonance spectroscopy data from a single volume of interest positioned in the periventricular white matter showed a clear shift in the neurochemical profile, particularly a significant increase in glycogen (result of acid α-glucosidase deficiency) and decrease in <i>N</i>-acetyl-aspartate (marker of neuronal damage) in patients. Magnetic resonance spectroscopy imaging results were in line and showed a widespread accumulation of glycogen and a significant lower level of <i>N</i>-acetyl-aspartate in patients. Our results illustrate the unique potential of <sup>1</sup>H magnetic resonance spectroscopy (imaging) to provide a non-invasive readout of the disease pathology in the brain. Further study will assess its potential to monitor disease progression and the correlation with cognitive decline.","Chloé Najac, Nadine A M E van der Beek, Vincent O Boer, Pieter A van Doorn, Ans T van der Ploeg, Itamar Ronen, Hermien E Kan, Johanna M P van den Hout",2024

Preclinical lentiviral hematopoietic stem cell gene therapy corrects Pompe disease-related muscle and neurological manifestations.,"Pompe disease, a rare genetic neuromuscular disorder, is caused by a deficiency of acid alpha-glucosidase (GAA), leading to an accumulation of glycogen in lysosomes, and resulting in the progressive development of muscle weakness. The current standard treatment, enzyme replacement therapy (ERT), is not curative and has limitations such as poor penetration into skeletal muscle and both the central and peripheral nervous systems, a risk of immune responses against the recombinant enzyme, and the requirement for high doses and frequent infusions. To overcome these limitations, lentiviral vector-mediated hematopoietic stem and progenitor cell (HSPC) gene therapy has been proposed as a next-generation approach for treating Pompe disease. This study demonstrates the potential of lentiviral HSPC gene therapy to reverse the pathological effects of Pompe disease in a preclinical mouse model. It includes a comprehensive safety assessment via integration site analysis, along with single-cell RNA sequencing analysis of central nervous tissue samples to gain insights into the underlying mechanisms of phenotype correction.","John K Yoon, Jeffrey W Schindler, Mariana Loperfido, Cristina Baricordi, Mark P DeAndrade, Mary E Jacobs, Christopher Treleaven, Robert N Plasschaert, Aimin Yan, Cecilia N Barese, Yildirim Dogan, Vicky Ping Chen, Claudia Fiorini, Fritz Hull, Luigi Barbarossa, Zeenath Unnisa, Daniel Ivanov, Robert H Kutner, Swaroopa Guda, Christine Oborski, Tim Maiwald, Véronique Michaud, Michael Rothe, Axel Schambach, Richard Pfeifer, Chris Mason, Luca Biasco, Niek P van Til",2024
Association between under-dose of enzyme replacement therapy and quality of life in adults with late-onset Pompe disease in China: A retrospective matched cohort study.,"Due to the high cost of enzyme replacement therapy (ERT), most of adults with late-onset Pompe disease (LOPD) who received ERT used the medication with insufficient dosefs in China.","Huanyu Zhang, Shanquan Chen, Richard Huan Xu, Siyue Yu, Jiazhou Yu, Dong Dong",2024
Comparing the efficacy of cipaglucosidase alfa plus miglustat with other enzyme replacement therapies for late-onset Pompe disease: a network meta-analysis utilizing patient-level and aggregate data.,"<b>Aim:</b> Late-onset Pompe disease is characterized by progressive loss of muscular and respiratory function. Until recently, standard of care was enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) with alglucosidase alfa. Second-generation ERTs avalglucosidase alfa (aval) and cipaglucosidase alfa with miglustat (cipa+mig) are now available. Without head-to-head trials comparing aval with cipa+mig, an indirect treatment comparison is informative and timely for understanding potential clinical differentiation. <b>Materials & methods:</b> A systematic literature review was performed to identify relevant studies on cipa+mig and aval. Using patient-level and aggregate published data from randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and phase I/II and open-label extension (OLE) trials, a multi-level network meta-regression was conducted, adjusting for various baseline covariates, including previous ERT duration, to obtain relative effect estimates on 6-minute walk distance (6MWD, meters [m]) and forced vital capacity (FVC, % predicted [pp]). Analyses of two networks were conducted: Network A, including only RCTs, and network B, additionally including single-arm OLE and phase I/II studies. <b>Results:</b> Network B (full evidence analysis) showed that cipa+mig was associated with a relative increase in 6MWD (mean difference 28.93 m, 95% credible interval [8.26-50.11 m]; Bayesian probability 99.7%) and FVC (2.88 pp [1.07-4.71 pp]; >99.9%) compared with aval. The comparison between cipa+mig and aval became more favorable for cipa+mig with increasing previous ERT duration for both end points. Analysis of network A showed that cipa+mig was associated with a relative decrease in 6MWD (-10.02 m [-23.62 to 4.00 m]; 91.8%) and FVC (-1.45 pp [-3.01 to 0.07 pp]; 96.8%) compared with aval. <b>Conclusion:</b> Cipa+mig showed a favorable effect versus aval when all available evidence was used in the analysis.","Simon Shohet, Noemi Hummel, Shuai Fu, Ian Keyzor, Alasdair MacCulloch, Neil Johnson, Jeff Castelli, Ilona Czarny-Ozga, Tahseen Mozaffar, Howard Thom",2024
An expert rule-based approach for identifying infantile-onset Pompe disease patients using retrospective electronic health records.,"Pompe disease (OMIM #232300), a rare genetic disorder, leads to glycogen buildup in the body due to an enzyme deficiency, particularly harming the heart and muscles. Infantile-onset Pompe disease (IOPD) requires urgent treatment to prevent mortality, but the unavailability of these methods often delays diagnosis. Our study aims to streamline IOPD diagnosis in the UAE using electronic health records (EHRs) for faster, more accurate detection and timely treatment initiation. This study utilized electronic health records from the Abu Dhabi Healthcare Company (SEHA) healthcare network in the UAE to develop an expert rule-based screening approach operationalized through a dashboard. The study encompassed six diagnosed IOPD patients and screened 93,365 subjects. Expert rules were formulated to identify potential high-risk IOPD patients based on their age, particular symptoms, and creatine kinase levels. The proposed approach was evaluated using accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity. The proposed approach accurately identified five true positives, one false negative, and four false positive IOPD cases. The false negative case involved a patient with both Pompe disease and congenital heart disease. The focus on CHD led to the overlooking of Pompe disease, exacerbated by no measurement of creatine kinase. The false positive cases were diagnosed with Mitochondrial DNA depletion syndrome 12-A (SLC25A4 gene), Immunodeficiency-71 (ARPC1B mutation), Niemann-Pick disease type C (NPC1 gene mutation leading to frameshift), and Group B Streptococcus meningitis. The proposed approach of integrating expert rules with a dashboard facilitated efficient data visualization and automated patient screening, which aids in the early detection of Pompe disease. Future studies are encouraged to investigate the application of machine learning methodologies to enhance further the precision and efficiency of identifying patients with IOPD.","Jaloliddin Rustamov, Zahiriddin Rustamov, Mohd Saberi Mohamad, Nazar Zaki, Amal Al Tenaiji, Mariam Al Harbi, Fatma Al Jasmi",2024
Neurological glycogen storage diseases and emerging therapeutics.,"Glycogen storage diseases (GSDs) comprise a group of inherited metabolic disorders characterized by defects in glycogen metabolism, leading to abnormal glycogen accumulation in multiple tissues, most notably affecting the liver, skeletal muscle, and heart. Recent findings have uncovered the importance of glycogen metabolism in the brain, sustaining a myriad of physiological functions and linking its perturbation to central nervous system (CNS) pathology. This link resulted in classification of neurological-GSDs (n-GSDs), a group of diseases with shared deficits in neurological glycogen metabolism. The n-GSD patients exhibit a spectrum of clinical presentations with common etiology while requiring tailored therapeutic approaches from the traditional GSDs. Recent research has elucidated the genetic and biochemical mechanisms and pathophysiological basis underlying different n-GSDs. Further, the last decade has witnessed some promising developments in novel therapeutic approaches, including enzyme replacement therapy (ERT), substrate reduction therapy (SRT), small molecule drugs, and gene therapy targeting key aspects of glycogen metabolism in specific n-GSDs. This preclinical progress has generated noticeable success in potentially modifying disease course and improving clinical outcomes in patients. Herein, we provide an overview of current perspectives on n-GSDs, emphasizing recent advances in understanding their molecular basis, therapeutic developments, underscore key challenges and the need to deepen our understanding of n-GSDs pathogenesis to develop better therapeutic strategies that could offer improved treatment and sustainable benefits to the patients.","Matthieu Colpaert, Pankaj K Singh, Katherine J Donohue, Natacha T Pires, David D Fuller, Manuela Corti, Barry J Byrne, Ramon C Sun, Craig W Vander Kooi, Matthew S Gentry",2024
Mutation Spectrum of <i>GAA</i> Gene in Pompe Disease: Current Knowledge and Results of an Italian Study.,"Studying a patient with Pompe disease (PD) is like opening Pandora's box. The specialist is faced with numerous clinical features similar to those of several diseases, and very often the symptoms are well hidden and none is associated with this rare disease. In recent years, scientific interest in this disease has been growing more and more, but still no symptom is recognized as key to a correct diagnosis of it, nor is there any specific disease marker to date. New diagnostic/therapeutic proposals on disease allow for the diffusion of knowledge of this pathology for timely diagnosis of the patient. Due to unawareness and difficulty in diagnosis, many adults with PD are diagnosed with great delay. In this article, we report and discuss current knowledge of PD and provide new data from work conducted on a cohort of 2934 Italian subjects recruited in recent years. A genetic analysis of the <i>GAA</i> gene was performed on patients with significant clinical signs and pathological enzyme activity to define the genetic profile of subjects. This identified 39 symptomatic PD subjects with low acid alpha-glucosidase enzyme activity and the presence of two causative mutations in <i>GAA</i> gene regions. Furthermore, 22 subjects with genetic variants of uncertain significance (GVUS) were identified.","Marta Moschetti, Alessia Lo Curto, Miriam Giacomarra, Daniele Francofonte, Carmela Zizzo, Elisa Messina, Giovanni Duro, Paolo Colomba",2024
Non-invasive optoacoustic imaging of glycogen-storage and muscle degeneration in late-onset Pompe disease.,"Pompe disease (PD) is a rare autosomal recessive glycogen storage disorder that causes proximal muscle weakness and loss of respiratory function. While enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) is the only effective treatment, biomarkers for disease monitoring are scarce. Following ex vivo biomarker validation in phantom studies, we apply multispectral optoacoustic tomography (MSOT), a laser- and ultrasound-based non-invasive imaging approach, in a clinical trial (NCT05083806) to image the biceps muscles of 10 late-onset PD (LOPD) patients and 10 matched healthy controls. MSOT is compared with muscle magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), ultrasound, spirometry, muscle testing and quality of life scores. Next, results are validated in an independent LOPD patient cohort from a second clinical site. Our study demonstrates that MSOT enables imaging of subcellular disease pathology with increases in glycogen/water, collagen and lipid signals, providing higher sensitivity in detecting muscle degeneration than current methods. This translational approach suggests implementation in the complex care of these rare disease patients.","Lina Tan, Jana Zschüntzsch, Stefanie Meyer, Alica Stobbe, Hannah Bruex, Adrian P Regensburger, Merle Claßen, Frauke Alves, Jörg Jüngert, Ulrich Rother, Yi Li, Vera Danko, Werner Lang, Matthias Türk, Sandy Schmidt, Matthias Vorgerd, Lara Schlaffke, Joachim Woelfle, Andreas Hahn, Alexander Mensch, Martin Winterholler, Regina Trollmann, Rafael Heiß, Alexandra L Wagner, Roman Raming, Ferdinand Knieling",2024
High-risk screening for late-onset Pompe disease in China: An expanded multicenter study.,"Late-onset Pompe disease (LOPD) is caused by a genetic deficiency of the lysosomal enzyme acid alpha-glucosidase (GAA), leading to progressive limb-girdle weakness and respiratory impairment. The insidious onset of non-specific early symptoms often prohibits timely diagnosis. This study aimed to validate the high-risk screening criteria for LOPD in the Chinese population. A total of 726 patients were included, including 96 patients under 14 years of age. Dried blood spots (DBS) and tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) were employed to evaluate serum GAA activity. Forty-four patients exhibited a decreased GAA activity, 16 (2.2%) of which were confirmed as LOPD by genetic testing. Three previously unreported GAA mutations were also identified. The median diagnostic delay was shortened to 3 years, which excelled the previous retrospective studies. At diagnosis, most patients exhibited impaired respiratory function and/or limb-girdle weakness. Elevated serum creatine kinase (CK) levels were more frequently observed in patients who manifested before age 16. Overall, high-risk screening is a feasible and efficient method to identify LOPD patients at an early stage. Patients over 1 year of age with either weakness in axial and/or proximal limb muscles, or unexplained respiratory distress shall be subject to GAA enzymatic test, while CK levels above 2 times the upper normal limit shall be an additional criterion for patients under 16. This modified high-risk screening criteria for LOPD requires further validation in larger Chinese cohorts.","Kexin Jiao, Bochen Zhu, Xueli Chang, Junhong Guo, Jun Fu, Xueqin Song, Xuen Yu, Xiaoge Zhang, Jihong Dong, Wang Yan, Xinghua Luan, Zhiqiang Wang, Hong Han, Lijun Du, Liqiang Yu, Yali Zhang, Jingjing Zhang, Yan Chen, Jing Hu, Zhe Zhao, Juan Kang, Song Tan, Zhiyun Wang, Shanshan Mao, Fangyuan Qian, Ronghua Luo, Changxia Liu, Zhengyu Huang, Gang Li, Xia Li, Lijun Luo, Dong Li, Yuanlin Zhou, Xiafei Hu, Xuefan Yu, Yongguang Shi, Jianming Jiang, Jialong Zhang, Nachuan Cheng, Ningning Wang, Xingyu Xia, Dongyue Yue, Mingshi Gao, Jianying Xi, Sushan Luo, Jiahong Lu, Chongbo Zhao, Qing Ke, Mingming Ma, Wenhua Zhu",2024

Small molecule inhibition of glycogen synthase I reduces muscle glycogen content and improves biomarkers in a mouse model of Pompe disease.,"Pompe disease is a rare genetic disorder caused by a deficiency of the enzyme acid alpha-glucosidase (GAA). This enzyme is responsible for breaking down glycogen, leading to the abnormal accumulation of glycogen, which results in progressive muscle weakness and metabolic dysregulation. In this study, we investigated the hypothesis that the small molecule inhibition of glycogen synthase I (GYS1) may reduce muscle glycogen content and improve metabolic dysregulation in a mouse model of Pompe disease. To address this hypothesis, we studied four groups of male mice: a control group of wild-type (WT) B6129SF1/J mice fed either regular chow or a GYS1 inhibitor (MZ-101) diet (WT-GYS1), and Pompe model mice B6;129-Gaatm1Rabn/J fed either regular chow (GAA-KO) or MZ-101 diet (GAA-GYS1) for 7 days. Our findings revealed that GAA-KO mice exhibited abnormal glycogen accumulation in the gastrocnemius, heart, and diaphragm. In contrast, inhibiting GYS1 reduced glycogen levels in all tissues compared with GAA-KO mice. Furthermore, GAA-KO mice displayed reduced spontaneous activity during the dark cycle compared with WT mice, whereas GYS1 inhibition counteracted this effect. Compared with GAA-KO mice, GAA-GYS1 mice exhibited improved glucose tolerance and whole body insulin sensitivity. These improvements in insulin sensitivity could be attributed to increased AMP-activated protein kinase phosphorylation in the gastrocnemius of WT-GYS1 and GAA-GYS1 mice. Additionally, the GYS1 inhibitor led to a reduction in the phosphorylation of GS<sup>S641</sup> and the LC3 autophagy marker. Together, our results suggest that targeting GYS1 could serve as a potential strategy for treating glycogen storage disorders and metabolic dysregulation.<b>NEW & NOTEWORTHY</b> We investigated the effects of small molecule inhibition of glycogen synthase I (GYS1) on glucose metabolism in a mouse model of Pompe disease. GYS1 inhibition reduces abnormal glycogen accumulation and molecular biomarkers associated with Pompe disease while also improving glucose intolerance. Our results collectively demonstrate that the GYS1 inhibitor represents a novel approach to substrate reduction therapy for Pompe disease.","Rafael Calais Gaspar, Ikki Sakuma, Ali Nasiri, Brandon T Hubbard, Traci E LaMoia, Brooks P Leitner, Samnang Tep, Yannan Xi, Eric M Green, Julie C Ullman, Kitt Falk Petersen, Gerald I Shulman",2024
What is in the Myopathy Literature?,"This update begins with a section on inflammatory myopathies covering inclusion body myositis in younger patients, the possibility of a pathogenic role for anti-cN1A antibodies, and a negative trial of arimoclomol in inclusion body myositis.

Other papers regarding GNE myopathy and long-term outcome of enzyme replacement therapy in infantile onset Pompe disease round out that section. Updates on the expanding spectra of anoctamin-5 myopathies, caveolinopathies, and congenital and mylagic myopathies from CACNA1S mutations follow as well as extensive discussion of Valosin containing protein proteinopathies, comprehensive management of Becker muscular dystrophy, and gastrointestinal complications in adult DMD.","Michael Isfort, David Lacomis",2024
Avalglucosidase alfa in infantile-onset Pompe disease: A snapshot of real-world experience in Italy.,"Infantile-onset Pompe disease (IOPD) is due to mutations in the <i>GAA</i> gene leading to profound deficiency of the lysosomal enzyme α-1,4-glucosidase. The disease is characterized by severe hypotonia, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, macroglossia, and liver enlargement with onset in the first months of life. In the late-onset form (LOPD), muscle signs predominate with a clinical picture resembling muscle dystrophies. Enzyme replacement therapy with alglucosidase alfa (rhGAA) has been available since 2006 and patients treated with the enzyme show improved outcomes. Nevertheless, there is evidence that some patients have a suboptimal response or, after an initial improvement, reach a plateau with stabilization of the clinical picture. Thus, a new enzyme formulation, avalglucosidase alfa (neoGAA), with a higher degree of mannosylation, was developed.","Agata Fiumara, Annamaria Sapuppo, Serena Gasperini, Viola Crescitelli, Michele Sacchini, Elena Procopio, Vincenza Gragnaniello, Alberto Burlina",2024
Adult Pompe disease: Analysis of 13 patients.,"Pompe Disease (PD) is a lysosomal disorder caused by a deficiency of the enzyme acid alpha-glucosidase (GAA), primarily manifesting as a progressive myopathy with early respiratory involvement. Enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) is available since 2006.","Paloma Martín-Jiménez, Laura Bermejo-Guerrero, Ana Hernandez-Voth, Ana Arteche-López, Aurelio Hernández-Lain, María Rabasa, Cristina Domínguez-González",2024
Clinical insight meets scientific innovation to develop a next generation ERT for Pompe disease.,"Years of research into the structure, processing, and function of acid alpha-glucosidase led to the development and 2006 approval of alglucosidase alfa (recombinant human acid alpha-glucosidase, Myozyme®/Lumizyme®), an enzyme replacement therapy and the first approved treatment for Pompe disease. Alglucosidase alfa has been a lifesaving treatment for patients with infantile-onset Pompe disease and radically improved daily life for patients with late-onset Pompe disease; however, long-term experience with alglucosidase alfa unraveled key unmet needs in these populations. Despite treatment, Pompe disease continues to progress, especially from a skeletal muscle perspective, resulting in a multitude of functional limitations. Strong collaboration between the scientific and patient communities led to increased awareness of Pompe disease, a better understanding of disease pathophysiology, knowledge of the clinical course of the disease as patients surpassed the first decade of life, and the strengths and limitations of enzyme replacement therapy. Taken together, these advancements spurred the need for development of a next generation of enzyme replacement therapy and provided a framework for progress toward other novel treatments. This review provides an overview of the development of avalglucosidase alfa as a model to highlight the interaction between clinical experience with existing treatments, the role of the clinician scientist, translational research at both system and cellular levels, and the iterative and collaborative process that optimizes the development of therapeutics.","Priya S Kishnani, Yin-Hsiu Chien, Kenneth I Berger, Nate Thibault, Susan Sparks",2024
Long-term observation of patients with advanced late-onset Pompe disease undergoing enzyme replacement therapy: A 15-year observation in a single center.,There have been few descriptions in the literature on long-term enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) in patients with advanced late-onset Pompe disease (LOPD).,"Madoka Mori-Yoshimura, Hotake Takizawa, Atsushi Unuma, Yasushi Oya, Keisuke Yorimoto, Wakana Katsuta, Kenji Miyagi, Noriko Sato, Takatoshi Hara, Yuji Takahashi",2024
