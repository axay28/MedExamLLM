Psychological conditions of caregivers of adult subjects with Prader-Willi syndrome.,"Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) is a rare genetic neurodevelopmental disorder. Individuals with PWS face a range of cognitive, behavioral, and emotional challenges that require comprehensive and lifelong care, posing significant demands on their caregivers. The study is not only aimed to assess the psychological conditions of caregivers of adult subjects with PWS focusing on psychological distress and coping, but also to shed light on a crucial yet often overlooked aspect of healthcare. This study aims to compare the psychological well-being of individuals with PWS and their caregivers, providing valuable insights that can potentially improve the quality of care for these individuals. The sample recruited at the Division of Auxology, IRCCS Istituto Auxologico Italiano, was composed of 30 adult subjects with PWS (11 men and 19 women; mean age ± SD: 36.4 ± 10.31 years; mean Body Mass Index (BMI): 35.7 ± 8.92: kg/m2) and their caregivers (10 men and 20 women). To assess the psychological condition of caregivers, the Italian-validated versions of the Depression Anxiety and Stress Scale (DASS-21) and the Coping Orientation to the Problems Experiences (COPE) were used, while to assess the psychological well-being of individuals with PWS and their caregivers, the Italian validated version of the Psychological General Well-Being Index (PGWBI) was used.","Anna Guerrini Usubini, Adele Bondesan, Diana Caroli, Francesca Frigerio, Graziano Grugni, Gianluca Castelnuovo, Alessandro Sartorio",2024
Inpatient hospitalisations for patients with Prader-Willi syndrome: a 2019-2021 National Inpatient Sample analysis.,"Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) is a genetic disorder characterised by hyperphagia, intellectual disability and increased propensity to a range of medical disorders. To better characterise the clinical presentation of PWS across the lifespan, this study reports on the demographics and clinical diagnosis of individuals with PWS hospitalised in the United States.","J Luccarelli, T V Strong, T H McCoy",2024
Neuropeptide therapeutics to repress lateral septum neurons that disable sociability in an autism mouse model.,"Confronting oxytocin and vasopressin deficits in autism spectrum disorders and rare syndromes brought promises and disappointments for the treatment of social disabilities. We searched downstream of oxytocin and vasopressin for targets alleviating social deficits in a mouse model of Prader-Willi syndrome and Schaaf-Yang syndrome, both associated with high prevalence of autism. We found a population of neurons in the lateral septum-activated on termination of social contacts-which oxytocin and vasopressin inhibit as per degree of peer affiliation. These are somatostatin neurons expressing oxytocin receptors coupled to GABA-B signaling, which are inhibited via GABA-A channels by vasopressin-excited GABA neurons. Loss of oxytocin or vasopressin signaling recapitulated the disease phenotype. By contrast, deactivation of somatostatin neurons or receptor signaling alleviated social deficits of disease models by increasing the duration of contacts with mates and strangers. These findings provide new insights into the treatment framework of social disabilities in neuropsychiatric disorders.","Amélie M Borie, Yann Dromard, Prabahan Chakraborty, Pierre Fontanaud, Emilie M Andre, Amaury François, Pascal Colson, Françoise Muscatelli, Gilles Guillon, Michel G Desarménien, Freddy Jeanneteau",2024
Diversity of Molecular Functions of RNA-Binding Ubiquitin Ligases from the MKRN Protein Family.,"Makorin RING finger protein family includes four members (MKRN1, MKRN2, MKRN3, and MKRN4) that belong to E3 ubiquitin ligases and play a key role in various biological processes, such as cell survival, cell differentiation, and innate and adaptive immunity. MKRN1 contributes to the tumor growth suppression, energy metabolism, anti-pathogen defense, and apoptosis and has a broad variety of targets, including hTERT, APC, FADD, p21, and various viral proteins. MKRN2 regulates cell proliferation, inflammatory response; its targets are p65, PKM2, STAT1, and other proteins. MKRN3 is a master regulator of puberty timing; it controls the levels of gonadotropin-releasing hormone in the arcuate nucleus neurons. MKRN4 is the least studied member of the MKRN protein family, however, it is known to contribute to the T cell activation by ubiquitination of serine/threonine kinase MAP4K3. Proteins of the MKRN family are associated with the development of numerous diseases, for example, systemic lupus erythematosus, central precocious puberty, Prader-Willi syndrome, degenerative lumbar spinal stenosis, inflammation, and cancer. In this review, we discuss the functional roles of all members of the MKRN protein family and their involvement in the development of diseases.","Ekaterina A Guseva, Maria A Emelianova, Vera N Sidorova, Anatoly N Tyulpakov, Olga A Dontsova, Petr V Sergiev",2024
Characterization of Circulating Protein Profiles in Individuals with Prader-Willi Syndrome and Individuals with Non-Syndromic Obesity.,"<b>Background:</b> Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) is a rare genetic disorder characterized by distinctive physical, cognitive, and behavioral manifestations, coupled with profound alterations in appetite regulation, leading to severe obesity and metabolic dysregulation. These clinical features arise from disruptions in neurodevelopment and neuroendocrine regulation, yet the molecular intricacies of PWS remain incompletely understood. <b>Methods</b>: This study aimed to comprehensively profile circulating neuromodulatory factors in the serum of 53 subjects with PWS and 34 patients with non-syndromic obesity, utilizing a proximity extension assay with the Olink Target 96 neuro-exploratory and neurology panels. The ANOVA <i>p</i>-values were adjusted for multiple testing using the Benjamani-Hochberg method. Protein-protein interaction networks were generated in STRING V.12. Corrplots were calculated with R4.2.2 by using the Hmisc, Performance Analytics, and Corrplot packages <b>Results</b>: Our investigation explored the potential genetic underpinnings of the circulating protein signature observed in PWS, revealing intricate connections between genes in the PWS critical region and the identified circulating proteins associated with impaired oxytocin, NAD metabolism, and sex-related neuromuscular impairment involving, CD38, KYNU, NPM1, NMNAT1, WFIKKN1, and GDF-8/MSTN. The downregulation of CD38 in individuals with PWS (<i>p</i> < 0.01) indicates dysregulation of oxytocin release, implicating pathways associated with NAD metabolism in which KYNU and NMNAT1 are involved and significantly downregulated in PWS (<i>p</i> < 0.01 and <i>p</i> < 0.05, respectively). Sex-related differences in the circulatory levels of WFIKKN1 and GDF-8/MSTN (<i>p</i> < 0.05) were also observed. <b>Conclusions:</b> This study highlights potential circulating protein biomarkers associated with impaired oxytocin, NAD metabolism, and sex-related neuromuscular impairment in PWS individuals with potential clinical implications.","Devis Pascut, Pablo José Giraudi, Cristina Banfi, Stefania Ghilardi, Claudio Tiribelli, Adele Bondesan, Diana Caroli, Graziano Grugni, Alessandro Sartorio",2024
Effects of long-term transcutaneous auricular vagus nerve stimulation on circadian vagal activity in people with Prader-Willi Syndrome: A case-series.,"Prader-Willi Syndrome (PWS) is a genetic neurodevelopmental disorder marked by disruptions in circadian rhythms and autonomic nervous system (ANS) activity, hyperphagia, and episodes of emotional outbursts. Previous trials suggest that both invasive and non-invasive vagus nerve stimulation (VNS) can reduce emotional outbursts in PWS, potentially through its effects on vagal activity.","Maximilian Schmausser, Anthony Holland, Jessica Beresford-Webb, Stephen J Eglen, Katie Manning, Lucie Aman, Dina Kronhaus, Julian Koenig",2024
Another look at the necessity of polysomnography for infants with Prader-Willi syndrome prior to initiation of growth hormone therapy.,"The average age of diagnosis of Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) in most countries is less than 6 months of age. With the current medical knowledge of the benefits of growth hormone for infants with PWS, including improved cognitive function and improved psychomotor development, parents of infants with PWS want growth hormone therapy initiated as soon as possible. But the current recommendations to perform overnight polysomnography prior to initiation of growth hormone treatment often delays the initiation of therapy. We submit that overnight polysomnography for young infants (<6 months of age) is not necessary prior to growth hormone treatment, as there are no findings on polysomnography in this age group that should delay or prevent the initiation of growth hormone therapy.","Esraa Ismail, Jennifer Miller",2024
The motivations and methods behind sharing a pediatric Prader-Willi syndrome diagnosis.,"Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) is a genetic condition caused by a lack of paternally-expressed imprinted genes at chromosome 15q11.2-q13 and characterized by hyperphagia, behavioral challenges, and variable intellectual disability. Once a PWS diagnosis is established, sharing diagnosis information with an affected child can be challenging due to its early age of onset and diverse phenotype. This mixed-methods study aimed to evaluate how parents and guardians have shared a PWS diagnosis with their child and examine the motivating and influencing factors behind their disclosure. Parents and guardians of children with PWS aged at least 5 years completed a survey, and a select group completed an interview. A total of 51 surveys and 15 interviews were completed, with the majority of participants (n = 46; 90%) having shared at least some diagnosis information with their child. Parents and guardians were more likely to disclose if they self-reported a higher level of knowledge about PWS (p = 0.004) and if their child is currently older (p = 0.02) and/or has at least one sibling (p = 0.046). Interview analysis revealed 15 themes and 10 subthemes that illustrated parents' motivations, methods, and experiences with disclosure. This research provides information for others considering disclosure of PWS or another rare diagnosis with their child.","Victoria F Moy, Jessica J Denton, Jessica E Bohonowych, Theresa V Strong",2024

Comprehensive molecular and clinical findings in 29 patients with multi-locus imprinting disturbance.,"Multi-locus imprinting disturbance (MLID) with methylation defects in various differentially methylated regions (DMRs) has recently been identified in approximately 150 cases with imprinting disorders (IDs), and deleterious variants have been found in genes related to methylation maintenance of DMRs, such as those encoding proteins constructing the subcortical maternal complex (SCMC), in a small fraction of patients and/or their mothers. However, integrated methylation analysis for DMRs and sequence analysis for MLID-causative genes in MLID cases and their mothers have been performed only in a single study focusing on Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome (BWS) and Silver-Russell syndrome (SRS) phenotypes.","Tatsuki Urakawa, Hidenobu Soejima, Kaori Yamoto, Kaori Hara-Isono, Akie Nakamura, Sayaka Kawashima, Hiromune Narusawa, Rika Kosaki, Yutaka Nishimura, Kazuki Yamazawa, Tetsuo Hattori, Yukako Muramatsu, Takanobu Inoue, Keiko Matsubara, Maki Fukami, Shinji Saitoh, Tsutomu Ogata, Masayo Kagami",2024
Epigenomic newborn screening for conditions with intellectual disability and autistic features in Australian newborns.,"This study describes a protocol to assess a novel workflow called Epi-Genomic Newborn Screening (EpiGNs) on 100,000 infants from the state of Victoria, Australia. The workflow uses a first-tier screening approach called methylation-specific quantitative melt analysis (MS-QMA), followed by second and third tier testing including targeted methylation and copy number variation analyzes with droplet digital PCR, EpiTYPER system and low-coverage whole genome sequencing. EpiGNs utilizes only two 3.2 mm newborn blood spot punches to screen for genetic conditions, including fragile X syndrome, Prader-Willi syndrome, Angelman syndrome, Dup15q syndrome and sex chromosome aneuploidies. The program aims to: identify clinically actionable methylation screening thresholds for the first-tier screen and estimate prevalence for the conditions screened.","Mohammed Alshawsh, Melissa Wake, Jozef Gecz, Mark Corbett, Richard Saffery, James Pitt, Ronda Greaves, Katrina Williams, Michael Field, Jeanie Cheong, Minh Bui, Sheena Arora, Simon Sadedin, Sebastian Lunke, Meg Wall, David J Amor, David E Godler",2024
The influence of genotype makeup on the effectiveness of growth hormone therapy in children with Prader-Willi syndrome.,Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) is a rare multisystemic hereditary illness.

The Effects of Growth Hormone Treatment Beyond Growth Promotion in Patients with Genetic Syndromes: A Systematic Review of the Literature.,"Recombinant human growth hormone therapy (rhGH) has been widely accepted as the safe treatment for short stature in children with such genetic syndromes as Prader-Willi syndrome and Turner or Noonan syndrome. Some patients with short stature and rare genetic syndromes are treated with rhGH as growth hormone-deficient individuals or as children born small for their gestational age. After years of experience with this therapy in syndromic short stature, it has been proved that there are some aspects of long-term rhGH treatment beyond growth promotion, which can justify rhGH use in these individuals. This paper summarizes the data of a literature review of the effects of rhGH treatment beyond growth promotion in selected genetic syndromes. We chose three of the most common syndromes, Prader-Willi, Turner, and Noonan, in which rhGH treatment is indicated, and three rarer syndromes, Silver-Russel, Kabuki, and Duchenne muscular dystrophy, in which rhGH treatment is not widely indicated. Many studies have shown a significant impact of rhGH therapy on body composition, resting energy expenditure, insulin sensitivity, muscle tonus, motor function, and mental and behavioral development. Growth promotion is undoubtedly the primary benefit of rhGH therapy; nevertheless, especially with genetic syndromes, the additional effects should also be considered as important indications for this treatment.","Anna Kucharska, Ewelina Witkowska-Sędek, Michał Erazmus, Dorota Artemniak-Wojtowicz, Maria Krajewska, Beata Pyrżak",2024
Comparative study of emotional facial expression recognition among Prader-Willi syndrome subtypes.,"Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) is a congenital disease caused by a rare and generally non-inherited genetic disorder. The inability to recognise facial expressions of emotion is an apparent social cognition deficit in people diagnosed with PWS. The main objective of the present study is to compare the ability to recognise emotional facial expression, in both non-contextualised and contextualised scenarios, among the main subtypes of PWS and a control group.","A Perosanz, J F López-Paz, I Amayra, M García, O Martínez",2024
Inpatient Hospitalizations for COVID-19 Among Patients with Prader-Willi Syndrome: a National Inpatient Sample Analysis.,"Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) is a genetic disorder associated with baseline respiratory impairment caused by multiple contributing etiologies. While this may be expected to increase the risk of severe COVID-19 infections in PWS patients, survey studies have suggested paradoxically low disease severity. To better characterize the course of COVID-19 infection in patients with PWS, this study analyzes the outcomes of hospitalizations for COVID-19 among patients with and without PWS.","James Luccarelli, Theresa V Strong, Emily B Rubin, Thomas H McCoy",2024
Differences in Bone Metabolism between Children with Prader-Willi Syndrome during Growth Hormone Treatment and Healthy Subjects: A Pilot Study.,"Despite therapy with growth hormone (GH) in children with Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS), low bone mineral density and various orthopedic deformities have been observed often. Therefore, this study aimed to analyze bone markers, with an emphasis on vitamin K-dependent proteins (VKDPs), in normal-weight children with PWS undergoing GH therapy and a low-energy dietary intervention. Twenty-four children with PWS and 30 healthy children of the same age were included. Serum concentrations of bone alkaline phosphatase (BALP), osteocalcin (OC), carboxylated-OC (Gla-OC), undercarboxylated-OC (Glu-OC), periostin, osteopontin, osteoprotegerin (OPG), sclerostin, C-terminal telopeptide of type I collagen (CTX-I), and insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I) were determined using immunoenzymatic methods. OC levels and the OC/CTX-I ratios were lower in children with PWS than in healthy children (<i>p</i> = 0.011, <i>p</i> = 0.006, respectively). Glu-OC concentrations were lower (<i>p</i> = 0.002), but Gla-OC and periostin concentrations were higher in patients with PWS compared with the controls (<i>p</i> = 0.005, <i>p</i> < 0.001, respectively). The relationships between IGF-I and OC (<i>p</i> = 0.013), Gla-OC (<i>p</i> = 0.042), and the OC/CTX-I ratio (<i>p</i> = 0.017) were significant after adjusting for age in children with PWS. Bone turnover disorders in children with PWS may result from impaired bone formation due to the lower concentrations of OC and the OC/CTX-I ratio. The altered profile of OC forms with elevated periostin concentrations may indicate more intensive carboxylation processes of VKDPs in these patients. The detailed relationships between the GH/IGF-I axis and bone metabolism markers, particularly VKDPs, in children with PWS requires further research.","Joanna Gajewska, Magdalena Chełchowska, Katarzyna Szamotulska, Witold Klemarczyk, Małgorzata Strucińska, Jadwiga Ambroszkiewicz",2024
"The relationship between cardiac activity, behaviour and endogenous oxytocin and vasopressin in Prader-Willi Syndrome: An exploratory study.","This study aimed to increase our understanding of cardiac activity abnormalities in Prader-Willi Syndrome (PWS) and the relationship between cardiac activity, PWS behaviours thought to be associated with cardiac vagal tone and endogenous oxytocin and vasopressin levels. We compared cardiac activity (respiratory sinus arrhythmia (RSA), low-frequency heart rate variability (LF-HRV), heart period) in 30 adolescents and adults with PWS to 30 typically developing age-matched controls. RSA, LF-HRV, and heart period were lower in individuals with PWS than in the control group. In the control group, RSA was higher for females than males. However, for those with PWS, there was no difference between the sexes. Individuals with the mUPD genetic subtype had lower RSA and LF-HRV than participants with the PWS deletion subtype and compared to typically developing controls, no difference was found between the latter two groups. Heart period was also lower for those with mUPD compared to controls. Higher RSA reduced the odds of having temper outbursts and skin-picking. RSA was lower in those with PWS and psychosis compared to those with PWS without psychosis. Finally, we found RSA correlated with vasopressin for those with mUPD but not deletion. There was no relationship between RSA and oxytocin plasma or saliva levels. Our findings suggest autonomic dysfunction in PWS that is more marked in mUPD than deletion and potentially due to greater loss of parasympathetic activity in mUPD.","Lauren J Rice, Josephine Agu, C Sue Carter, Yoon Hi Cho, James Harris, Keri Heilman, Hans P Nazarloo, Habiba Naanai, Stephen Porges, Stewart L Einfeld",2024
Parent-of-origin-specific DNA replication timing is confined to large imprinted regions.,"Genomic imprinting involves differential DNA methylation and gene expression between homologous paternal and maternal loci. It remains unclear, however, whether DNA replication also shows parent-of-origin-specific patterns at imprinted or other genomic regions. Here, we investigate genome-wide asynchronous DNA replication utilizing uniparental human embryonic stem cells containing either maternal-only (parthenogenetic) or paternal-only (androgenetic) DNA. Four clusters of imprinted genes exhibited differential replication timing based on parent of origin, while the remainder of the genome, 99.82%, showed no significant replication asynchrony between parental origins. Active alleles in imprinted gene clusters replicated earlier than their inactive counterparts. At the Prader-Willi syndrome locus, replication asynchrony spanned virtually the entirety of S phase. Replication asynchrony was carried through differentiation to neuronal precursor cells in a manner consistent with gene expression. This study establishes asynchronous DNA replication as a hallmark of large imprinted gene clusters.","Matthew M Edwards, Ning Wang, Ido Sagi, Shay Kinreich, Nissim Benvenisty, Jeannine Gerhardt, Dieter Egli, Amnon Koren",2024
Deciphering the physiopathology of neurodevelopmental disorders using brain organoids.,"Neurodevelopmental disorders (NDD) encompass a range of conditions marked by abnormal brain development in conjunction with impaired cognitive, emotional, and behavioural functions. Transgenic animal models, mainly rodents, traditionally served as key tools for deciphering the molecular mechanisms driving NDD physiopathology, and significantly contributed to the development of pharmacological interventions aimed at treating these disorders. However, the efficacy of these treatments in humans has proven to be limited, due in part to the intrinsic constraint of animal models to recapitulate the complex development and structure of the human brain but also to the phenotypic heterogeneity found between affected individuals. Significant advancements in the field of induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSC) offer a promising avenue for overcoming these challenges. Indeed, the development of advanced differentiation protocols for generating iPSC-derived brain organoids gives the unprecedented opportunity to explore the human neurodevelopment. This review provides an overview of how 3D brain organoids have been used to investigate various NDD (i.e., Fragile X syndrome, Rett syndrome, Angelman syndrome, microlissencephaly, Prader-Willi syndrome, Timothy Syndrome, tuberous sclerosis syndrome), and elucidate their pathophysiology. We also discuss the benefits and limitations of employing such innovative 3D models compared to animal models and 2D cell culture systems, in the realm of personalized medicine.","Olivier Dionne, Salomé Sabatié, Benoit Laurent",2024
Cohen Syndrome With Complex Medical Complications: A Case Report.,"Cohen syndrome (CS) is a rare autosomal recessive disorder marked by developmental delays, distinct facial features, and a variety of systemic manifestations. We present a case of a 28-year-old male previously misdiagnosed with Prader-Willi syndrome who exhibited recurrent generalized weakness, fever, fatigue, and significant hemoglobin drops requiring multiple blood transfusions due to thalassemia major. The patient displayed characteristic CS features, including developmental delays, distinct facial characteristics, morbid obesity, and heterochromia iridis. Severe gastrointestinal bleeding led to a diagnosis of ulcerative colitis (UC) via colonoscopy. Management included blood transfusions, hydrocortisone, mesalamine, and azathioprine, resulting in stabilized UC and improved overall health. CS presents with a spectrum of clinical features that overlap with other syndromic conditions, necessitating careful differential diagnosis. Early diagnosis and supportive care significantly improve quality of life and help manage complications effectively.","Fathi S Milhem, Ameer Awashra, Husam Hamshary, Zaid Sawaftah, Amr Khaled, Noor Nabresi, Israa Salman",2024
Management of food socialization for children with Prader-Willi Syndrome: An exploration study in Malaysia.,"This study aims to explore the food management strategies among caregivers/family members of children with Prader-Willi Syndrome (PWS) using the lens of 'familialisation' of a health problem and the sociology of food socialization. Food intake among individuals with PWS is a main concern for parents, caregivers, and medical practitioners as it affects their physical, mental, and social well-being throughout their lives. Earlier studies on PWS and food intake centered around dietary management, dietary intake and growth, nutritional treatment and pharmacological approaches, nutritional phases, and weight gain. However, little has been done to understand the challenges of managing children with PWS from the sociological lens of food management strategies and socialization among families in Malaysia. This study is based on an investigation involving eight children with PWS and 46 family members and caregivers through lab observations and reflexive interviews. Ten food management strategies were identified that were adopted by the caregivers and families, which were influenced by cultural factors, family norms, and formal and informal support systems. The findings will influence future behavioral interventions to ensure the empowerment and well-being of individuals with PWS and their families.","Puspa Melati Wan, Affezah Ali, Elise Mognard, Anasuya Jegathevi Jegathesan, Soon Li Lee, Rajalakshmi Ganesan, Mohd Ismail Noor, Amandine Rochedy, Marion Valette, Maïthé Tauber, Meow-Keong Thong, Jean-Pierre Poulain",2024
Is Oxytocin a Contributor to Behavioral and Metabolic Features in Prader-Willi Syndrome?,"Prader-Willi Syndrome (PWS) is a rare genetic disorder typically characterized by decreased social interaction, hyperphagia, poor behavioral control and temper tantrums, together with a high risk of morbid obesity unless food intake is controlled. The genetic defects that cause PWS include paternal 15q deletion (estimated in 60% of cases), chromosome 15 maternal uniparental disomy (UPD) (estimated in 35% of cases) and imprinting defects and translocations. Several studies indicate an oxytocin deficiency in PWS. Oxytocin is a hypothalamic nonapeptide with receptors located in the brain and in various other tissues in the body. It acts as a neuropeptide in several brain areas of great importance for behavioral and metabolic effects, as well as a neurohypophyseal hormone released into the circulation. Oxytocin in both rats and humans has strong and long-lasting behavioral and metabolic effects. Thus, an oxytocin deficiency might be involved in several of the behavioral and metabolic symptoms characterizing PWS. Treatment with oxytocin has, in some studies, shown improvement in psycho-social behavior and hyperphagia in individuals with PWS. This review focus on the behavioral and metabolic effects of oxytocin, the symptoms of a potential oxytocin deficiency in PWS and the effects of oxytocin treatment.","Maria Petersson, Charlotte Höybye",2024
Evaluation of an In-House Genetic Testing Method for Confirming Prader-Willi and Angelman Syndromes in Sri Lanka.,"Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS, MIM 176,270) and Angelman syndrome (AS, MIM 105,830) are caused by imprinting defects of chromosome 15q11-13, with loss of maternal gene expression causing AS and paternal gene expression causing PWS. The diagnosis, once established in most cases by using a methylation-specific PCR test, enables appropriate therapeutic interventions and avoids the need for further investigations. Genetic testing for PWS/AS is limited in Sri Lanka (and in other low- and middle-income countries), mainly because parents are unable to pay for testing as these are not funded by the health service.","Nirosha Kugalingam, Deepthi de Silva, Pyara Rathnayake, Navoda Atapattu, Dinali M Ranaweera, Naduviladath V Chandrasekharan",2024
Case Report: Plummer's adenoma in Prader-Willi syndrome.,"Thyroid nodules in children are less common than in adults but they are approximately two- to three-fold more likely to be malignant in children. Among thyroid nodular diseases, Plummer's adenoma occurs very rarely in pediatrics, and currently, there is no literature providing evidence of this diagnosis in patients with Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS). We report the case of a 9-year-old Caucasian boy affected by PWS presenting with a rapidly growing palpable mass in the thyroid lodge associated with subclinical hyperthyroidism. Laboratory and other examinations (thyroid ultrasound, fine-needle aspiration of the nodule, and scintigraphy) were strongly suggestive for Plummer's adenoma; therefore, the patient underwent left hemithyroidectomy surgery, and anatomo-pathological examination confirmed the diagnosis. Our case describes the first evidence of an isolated follicular adenoma in children with PWS. Surgery is the only therapeutic option in younger children. Further evidence is needed to assess the possible correlation between these two conditions and the existence of potential risk factors.","Domenico Corica, Fabio Toscano, Mariacarla Moleti, Giorgia Pepe, Alfredo Campenni, Guido Fadda, Gianlorenzo Dionigi, Carmelo Romeo, Tommaso Aversa, Malgorzata Wasniewska",2024
Aberrant behavior checklist in youth with Prader-Willi syndrome: Preliminary study of cross-sectional and longitudinal behavior characterization.,"Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) is a rare genetic disorder caused by the loss of paternal genes on chromosome 15. The Aberrant Behavior Checklist (ABC) is a standardized rating scale for assessing problematic behaviors in persons with developmental disabilities. Our study aims to describe ABC scores in youth with PWS and track their change over time. The analysis included 69 patients. Mean ABC scores were compared in four age groups (5-8, 9-12, 13-16, and 17-22 years). A statistically significant difference was found only in the Irritability subscale, with lower scores in the 5-8 age group compared to the 9-12 age group. For change over time, scores for Irritability, Lethargy, Stereotypic Behavior, Hyperactivity subscales, and Total score were likely to decrease after age 12. Irritability subscale scores of males were predicted to increase more than those of females between ages of 5 and 12 . The Lethargy score in the nondeletion group had a greater reduction than the deletion group in the 12-20 year range. This study highlights the need for systematic collection and characterization of behavioral data given the burden of maladaptive behaviors that often persist for a lifetime.","Soo-Jeong Kim, Lydia Kim, Waylon Howard, Bridget McNulty, Parisa Salehi",2024
Implication of locus coeruleus dysfunction in Prader-Willi syndrome: Insights from a mouse model.,"Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) is a multisystemic disorder. Notably, many characteristic symptoms of PWS are correlated with locus coeruleus norepinephrine system (LC-NE) dysfunction, including impairment in arousal, learning, pain modulation, and stress-induced negative affective states. Although electrophysiological experiments in necdin-deficient mice, an established PWS animal model, have revealed decreased spontaneous neuronal firing activity in the LC and impaired excitability, the behavioral phenotypes related to LC-NE dysfunction remain unexplored. In this study, heterozygous necdin-deficient mice (B6.Cg-Ndn<sup>tm1ky</sup>) were bred from wild-type (WT) females to generate WT (+m/+p) and heterozygous (+m/-p) animals. Compared to WT mice, Ndn + m/-p mice demonstrated impaired visual-spatial memory in the Y-maze test, reduced social interaction, impaired sexual recognition, and shorter falling latency on the Rotarod. Using the open field test (OFT) and elevated plus maze (EPM), we observed similar locomotion activity of Ndn + m/-p and WT mice, but Ndn + m/-p mice were less anxious. After acute restraint, Ndn + m/-p mice exhibited significant impairment in stress-induced anxiety. Additionally, the plasma norepinephrine surge following exposure to acute restraint stress was also impaired. Pretreatment with atomoxetine, a norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor aimed to enhance LC function, restored Ndn + m/-p mice to exhibit a normal response to acute restraint stress. Furthermore, by employing chemogenetic approaches to facilitate LC neuronal firing, post-stress anxious responses were also partially rescued in Ndn + m/-p mice. These data strongly suggest that LC dysfunction is implicated in the pathogenesis of stress-related neuropsychiatric symptoms in PWS. Manipulation of LC activity may hold therapeutic potential for patients with PWS.","Li-Ping Tsai, Da-Zhong Luo, Hao Chan, Wei-Chen Hung, Wen-Sung Lai, Ming-Yuan Min, Shi-Bing Wong",2024
Exploring the Diagnostic Complexity of Diabetes Subtypes in Pediatric Obesity: A Case Report of an Adolescent With Prader-Willi Phenotype and Literature Review.,"Obesity among adolescents poses a significant global health concern with profound short- and long-term impact on physical and mental well-being. The intricate relationship between obesity and the onset of diabetes remains ambiguous, particularly in cases where the manifestation may differ from that observed in individuals with uncomplicated obesity. Herein, we present the case of a 14-year-old male adolescent with Prader-Willi phenotype and subsequent obesity, exhibiting symptoms of polyuria and polydipsia over a 10-day period, indicative of potential diabetes mellitus (DM). Laboratory assessments revealed a hemoglobin A1c level of 10%, confirming the suspected diagnosis. Notably, despite the absence of ketosis, elevated C-peptide levels and the presence of slightly positive islet-cell antibodies warranted further investigation. While the presence of antibodies typically aligns with a diagnosis of type 1 DM, recent research has highlighted the occurrence of anti-insulin pancreatic cell antibodies in type 2 DM cases. This article aims to delve into the multifaceted issues surrounding adolescent obesity, atypical presentations of DM with positive antibodies, and the long-term management of patients with genetic syndromes.","Anca A Boboc, Mara I Ionescu, Elena Tataranu, Catalin Boboc, Felicia Galos",2024
Epigenetics in rare neurological diseases.,"Rare neurological diseases include a vast group of heterogenous syndromes with primary impairment(s) in the peripheral and/or central nervous systems. Such rare disorders may have overlapping phenotypes, despite their distinct genetic etiology. One unique aspect of rare neurological diseases is their potential common association with altered epigenetic mechanisms. Epigenetic mechanisms include regulatory processes that control gene expression and cellular phenotype without changing the composition of the corresponding DNA sequences. Epigenetic factors include three types of proteins, the ""readers, writers, and erasers"" of DNA and DNA-bound proteins. Thus, epigenetic impairments of many neurological diseases may contribute to their pathology and manifested phenotypes.
