miR126-mediated impaired vascular integrity in Rett syndrome.,"Rett syndrome (RTT) is a neurodevelopmental disorder that is caused by mutations in melty-CpG binding protein 2 (MeCP2). MeCP2 is a non-cell type-specific DNA binding protein, and its mutation influences not only neural cells but also non-neural cells in the brain, including vasculature associated with endothelial cells. Vascular integrity is crucial for maintaining brain homeostasis, and its alteration may be linked to the pathology of neurodegenerative disease, but a non-neurogenic effect, especially the relationship between vascular alternation and Rett syndrome pathogenesis, has not been shown. Here, we recapitulate a microvascular network using Rett syndrome patient-derived induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells that carry MeCP2[R306C] mutation to investigate early developmental vascular impact. To expedite endothelial cell differentiation, doxycycline (DOX)-inducible ETV2 expression vectors were inserted into the AAVS1 locus of Rett syndrome patient-derived iPS cells and its isogenic control by CRISPR/Cas9. With these endothelial cells, we established a disease microvascular network (Rett-dMVNs) and observed higher permeability in the Rett-dMVNs compared to isogenic controls, indicating altered barrier function by MeCP2 mutation. Furthermore, we unveiled that hyperpermeability is involved in the upregulation of miR126-3p in Rett syndrome patient-derived endothelial cells by microRNA profiling and RNAseq, and rescue of miR126-3p level can recover their phenotype. We discover miR126-3p-mediated vascular impairment in Rett syndrome patients and suggest the potential application of these findings for translational medicine.","Tatsuya Osaki, Zhengpeng Wan, Koji Haratani, Ylliah Jin, Macro Campisi, David A Barbie, Roger D Kamm, Mriganka Sur",2024
RettDb: the Rett syndrome omics database to navigate the Rett syndrome genomic landscape.,"Rett syndrome (RTT) is a neurodevelopmental disorder occurring almost exclusively in females and leading to a variety of impairments and disabilities from mild to severe. In >95% cases, RTT is due to mutations in the X-linked gene MECP2, but the molecular mechanisms determining RTT are unknown at present, and the complexity of the system is challenging. To facilitate and provide guidance to the unraveling of those mechanisms, we developed a database resource for the visualization and analysis of the genomic landscape in the context of wild-type or mutated Mecp2 gene in the mouse model. Our resource allows for the exploration of differential dynamics of gene expression and the prediction of new potential MECP2 target genes to decipher the RTT disorder molecular mechanisms.

Animal Models of Autistic-like Behavior in Rodents: A Scoping Review and Call for a Comprehensive Scoring System.,"Appropriate animal models of human diseases are a cornerstone in the advancement of science and medicine. To create animal models of neuropsychiatric and neurobehavioral diseases such as autism spectrum disorder (ASD) necessitates the development of sufficient neurobehavioral measuring tools to translate human behavior to expected measurable behavioral features in animals. If possible, the severity of the symptoms should also be assessed. Indeed, at least in rodents, adequate neurobehavioral and neurological tests have been developed. Since ASD is characterized by a number of specific behavioral trends with significant severity, animal models of autistic-like behavior have to demonstrate the specific characteristic features, namely impaired social interactions, communication deficits, and restricted, repetitive behavioral patterns, with association to several additional impairments such as somatosensory, motor, and memory impairments. Thus, an appropriate model must show behavioral impairment of a minimal number of neurobehavioral characteristics using an adequate number of behavioral tests. The proper animal models enable the study of ASD-like-behavior from the etiologic, pathogenetic, and therapeutic aspects. From the etiologic aspects, models have been developed by the use of immunogenic substances like polyinosinic-polycytidylic acid (PolyIC), lipopolysaccharide (LPS), and propionic acid, or other well-documented immunogens or pathogens, like <i>Mycobacterium tuberculosis.</i> Another approach is the use of chemicals like valproic acid, polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), organophosphate pesticides like chlorpyrifos (CPF), and others. These substances were administered either prenatally, generally after the period of major organogenesis, or, especially in rodents, during early postnatal life. In addition, using modern genetic manipulation methods, genetic models have been created of almost all human genetic diseases that are manifested by autistic-like behavior (i.e., fragile X, Rett syndrome, SHANK gene mutation, neuroligin genes, and others). Ideally, we should not only evaluate the different behavioral modes affected by the ASD-like behavior, but also assess the severity of the behavioral deviations by an appropriate scoring system, as applied to humans. We therefore propose a scoring system for improved assessment of ASD-like behavior in animal models.","Asher Ornoy, Boniface Echefu, Maria Becker",2024
Unraveling autophagic imbalances and therapeutic insights in Mecp2-deficient models.,"Loss-of-function mutations in MECP2 are associated to Rett syndrome (RTT), a severe neurodevelopmental disease. Mainly working as a transcriptional regulator, MeCP2 absence leads to gene expression perturbations resulting in deficits of synaptic function and neuronal activity. In addition, RTT patients and mouse models suffer from a complex metabolic syndrome, suggesting that related cellular pathways might contribute to neuropathogenesis. Along this line, autophagy is critical in sustaining developing neuron homeostasis by breaking down dysfunctional proteins, lipids, and organelles.Here, we investigated the autophagic pathway in RTT and found reduced content of autophagic vacuoles in Mecp2 knock-out neurons. This correlates with defective lipidation of LC3B, probably caused by a deficiency of the autophagic membrane lipid phosphatidylethanolamine. The administration of the autophagy inducer trehalose recovers LC3B lipidation, autophagosomes content in knock-out neurons, and ameliorates their morphology, neuronal activity and synaptic ultrastructure. Moreover, we provide evidence for attenuation of motor and exploratory impairment in Mecp2 knock-out mice upon trehalose administration. Overall, our findings open new perspectives for neurodevelopmental disorders therapies based on the concept of autophagy modulation.","Alessandro Esposito, Tommaso Seri, Martina Breccia, Marzia Indrigo, Giuseppina De Rocco, Francesca Nuzzolillo, Vanna Denti, Francesca Pappacena, Gaia Tartaglione, Simone Serrao, Giuseppe Paglia, Luca Murru, Stefano de Pretis, Jean-Michel Cioni, Nicoletta Landsberger, Fabrizia Claudia Guarnieri, Michela Palmieri",2024

Prediction and design of transcriptional repressor domains with large-scale mutational scans and deep learning.,"Regulatory proteins have evolved diverse repressor domains (RDs) to enable precise context-specific repression of transcription. However, our understanding of how sequence variation impacts the functional activity of RDs is limited. To address this gap, we generated a high-throughput mutational scanning dataset measuring the repressor activity of 115,000 variant sequences spanning more than 50 RDs in human cells. We identified thousands of clinical variants with loss or gain of repressor function, including TWIST1 HLH variants associated with Saethre-Chotzen syndrome and MECP2 domain variants associated with Rett syndrome. We also leveraged these data to annotate short linear interacting motifs (SLiMs) that are critical for repression in disordered RDs. Then, we designed a deep learning model called TENet ( T ranscriptional E ffector Net work) that integrates sequence, structure and biochemical representations of sequence variants to accurately predict repressor activity. We systematically tested generalization within and across domains with varying homology using the mutational scanning dataset. Finally, we employed TENet within a directed evolution sequence editing framework to tune the activity of both structured and disordered RDs and experimentally test thousands of designs. Our work highlights critical considerations for future dataset design and model training strategies to improve functional variant prioritization and precision design of synthetic regulatory proteins.","Raeline Valbuena, AkshatKumar Nigam, Josh Tycko, Peter Suzuki, Kaitlyn Spees, Aradhana, Sophia Arana, Peter Du, Roshni A Patel, Lacramiora Bintu, Anshul Kundaje, Michael C Bassik",2024
Sex-specific single cell-level transcriptomic signatures of Rett syndrome disease progression.,"Dominant X-linked diseases are uncommon due to female X chromosome inactivation (XCI). While random XCI usually protects females against X-linked mutations, Rett syndrome (RTT) is a female neurodevelopmental disorder caused by heterozygous MECP2 mutation. After 6-18 months of typical neurodevelopment, RTT girls undergo a poorly understood regression. We performed longitudinal snRNA-seq on cerebral cortex in a construct-relevant Mecp2e1 mutant mouse model of RTT, revealing transcriptional effects of cell type, mosaicism, and sex on progressive disease phenotypes. Across cell types, we observed sex differences in the number of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) with 6x more DEGs in mutant females than males. Unlike males, female DEGs emerged prior to symptoms, were enriched for homeostatic gene pathways in distinct cell types over time and correlated with disease phenotypes and human RTT cortical cell transcriptomes. Non-cell-autonomous effects were prominent and dynamic across disease progression of Mecp2e1 mutant females, indicating that wild-type-expressing cells normalize transcriptional homeostasis. These results advance our understanding of RTT progression and treatment.","Osman Sharifi, Viktoria Haghani, Kari E Neier, Keith J Fraga, Ian Korf, Sophia M Hakam, Gerald Quon, Nelson Johansen, Dag H Yasui, Janine M LaSalle",2024
Site-Blocking Antisense Oligonucleotides as a Mechanism to Fine-Tune MECP2 Expression.,"Rett syndrome (RTT) is a neurodevelopmental disorder caused by loss-of-function mutations in the methyl CpG binding protein 2 (MECP2) gene. Despite its severe phenotype, studies in mouse models suggest that restoring MeCP2 levels can reverse RTT symptomology. Nevertheless, traditional gene therapy approaches are hindered by MECP2's narrow therapeutic window, complicating the safe delivery of viral constructs without overshooting the threshold for toxicity. The 3' untranslated region (3'UTR) plays a key role in gene regulation, where factors like miRNAs bind to pre-mRNA and fine-tune expression. Given that each miRNA's contribution is modest, blocking miRNA binding may represent a potential therapeutic strategy for diseases with high dosage sensitivity, like RTT. Here, we present a series of site-blocking antisense oligonucleotides (sbASOs) designed to outcompete repressive miRNA binding at the MECP2 3'UTR. This strategy aims to increase MECP2 levels in patients with missense or late-truncating mutations, where the hypomorphic nature of the protein can be offset by increased abundance. Our results demonstrate that sbASOs can elevate MECP2 levels in a dose-dependent manner in SH-SY5Y and patient fibroblast cell lines, plateauing at levels projected to be safe. Confirming in vivo functionality, sbASO administration in wild-type mice led to significant MeCP2 upregulation and the emergence of phenotypes associated with MeCP2 overexpression. In a T158M neural stem cell model of RTT, sbASO treatment significantly increased MECP2 expression and levels of the downstream effector protein, brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF). These findings highlight the potential of sbASO-based therapies for MECP2-related disorders and advocate for their continued development.","Amanda M Vanderplow, Grace E Dodis, Yewon Rhee, Jakub J Cikowski, Sonia Gonzalez, Mackenzie L Smith, Rocco G Gogliotti",2024
The epigenetic modification of DNA methylation in neurological diseases.,"Methylation, a key epigenetic modification, is essential for regulating gene expression and protein function without altering the DNA sequence, contributing to various biological processes, including gene transcription, embryonic development, and cellular functions. Methylation encompasses DNA methylation, RNA methylation and histone modification. Recent research indicates that DNA methylation is vital for establishing and maintaining normal brain functions by modulating the high-order structure of DNA. Alterations in the patterns of DNA methylation can exert significant impacts on both gene expression and cellular function, playing a role in the development of numerous diseases, such as neurological disorders, cardiovascular diseases as well as cancer. Our current understanding of the etiology of neurological diseases emphasizes a multifaceted process that includes neurodegenerative, neuroinflammatory, and neurovascular events. Epigenetic modifications, especially DNA methylation, are fundamental in the control of gene expression and are critical in the onset and progression of neurological disorders. Furthermore, we comprehensively overview the role and mechanism of DNA methylation in in various biological processes and gene regulation in neurological diseases. Understanding the mechanisms and dynamics of DNA methylation in neural development can provide valuable insights into human biology and potentially lead to novel therapies for various neurological diseases.","Linke Li, Rui Chen, Hui Zhang, Jinsheng Li, Hao Huang, Jie Weng, Huan Tan, Tailin Guo, Mengyuan Wang, Jiang Xie",2024
USP15 inhibits hypoxia-induced IL-6 signaling by deubiquitinating and stabilizing MeCP2.,"Methyl-CpG binding protein 2 (MeCP2) is an important X-linked DNA methylation reader and a key heterochromatin organizer. The expression level of MeCP2 is crucial, as indicated by the observation that loss-of-function mutations of MECP2 cause Rett syndrome, whereas an extra copy spanning the MECP2 locus results in MECP2 duplication syndrome, both being progressive neurodevelopmental disorders. Our previous study demonstrated that MeCP2 protein expression is rapidly induced by renal ischemia-reperfusion injury (IRI) and protects the kidney from IRI through transcriptionally repressing the interleukin-6 (IL-6)/signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 signaling pathway. However, the mechanisms underlying the upregulation of MeCP2 have remained elusive. Here, by using two hypoxia cell models, hypoxia and reoxygenation and cobalt chloride stimulation, we confirmed that the removal of lysine 48-linked ubiquitination from MeCP2 prevented its proteasome-dependent degradation under hypoxic conditions. Through unbiased screening based on a deubiquitinating enzymes library, we identified ubiquitin-specific protease 15 (USP15) as a stabilizer of MeCP2. Further studies revealed that USP15 could attenuate hypoxia-induced MeCP2 degradation by cleaving lysine 48-linked ubiquitin chains from MeCP2, primarily targeting its C-terminal domain. Consistently, USP15 inhibited hypoxia-induced signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 activation, resulting in reduced transcription of IL-6 downstream genes. In summary, our study reveals an important role for USP15 in the maintenance of MeCP2 stability and the regulation of IL-6 signaling.","Zi-Tong Zhang, Shu-Xuan Niu, Chen-Hao Yu, Shi-Yuan Wan, Jiao Wang, Cheng-Yu Liu, Ling Zheng, Kun Huang, Yu Zhang",2024

The Multifaceted Role of L-Type Amino Acid Transporter 1 at the Blood-Brain Barrier: Structural Implications and Therapeutic Potential.,"L-type amino acid transporter 1 (LAT1) is integral to the transport of large neutral amino acids across the blood-brain barrier (BBB), playing a crucial role in brain homeostasis and the delivery of therapeutic agents. This review explores the multifaceted role of LAT1 in neurological disorders, including its structural and functional aspects at the BBB. Studies using advanced BBB models, such as induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived systems and quantitative proteomic analyses, have demonstrated LAT1's significant impact on drug permeability and transport efficiency. In Alzheimer's disease, LAT1-mediated delivery of anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective agents shows promise in overcoming BBB limitations. In Parkinson's disease, LAT1's role in transporting L-DOPA and other therapeutic agents highlights its potential in enhancing treatment efficacy. In phenylketonuria, studies have revealed polymorphisms and genetic variations of LAT1, which could be correlated to disease severity. Prodrugs of valproic acid, pregabalin, and gabapentin help use LAT1-mediated transport to increase the therapeutic activity and bioavailability of the prodrug in the brain. LAT1 has also been studied in neurodevelopment disorders like autism spectrum disorders and Rett syndrome, along with neuropsychiatric implications in depression. Its implications in neuro-oncology, especially in transporting therapeutic agents into cancer cells, show immense future potential. Phenotypes of LAT1 have also shown variations in the general population affecting their ability to respond to painkillers and anti-inflammatory drugs. Furthermore, LAT1-targeted approaches, such as functionalized nanoparticles and prodrugs, show promise in overcoming chemoresistance and enhancing drug delivery to the brain. The ongoing exploration of LAT1's structural characteristics and therapeutic applications reiterates its critical role in advancing treatments for neurological disorders.",H Shafeeq Ahmed,2024
Functional Neural Networks in Human Brain Organoids.,"Human brain organoids are 3-dimensional brain-like tissues derived from human pluripotent stem cells and hold promising potential for modeling neurological, psychiatric, and developmental disorders. While the molecular and cellular aspects of human brain organoids have been intensively studied, their functional properties such as organoid neural networks (ONNs) are largely understudied. Here, we summarize recent research advances in understanding, characterization, and application of functional ONNs in human brain organoids. We first discuss the formation of ONNs and follow up with characterization strategies including microelectrode array (MEA) technology and calcium imaging. Moreover, we highlight recent studies utilizing ONNs to investigate neurological diseases such as Rett syndrome and Alzheimer's disease. Finally, we provide our perspectives on the future challenges and opportunities for using ONNs in basic research and translational applications.","Longjun Gu, Hongwei Cai, Lei Chen, Mingxia Gu, Jason Tchieu, Feng Guo",2024
Involvement of extracellular vesicle microRNA clusters in developing healthy and Rett syndrome brain organoids.,"Rett syndrome (RTT) is a neurodevelopmental disorder caused by de novo mutations in the MECP2 gene. Although miRNAs in extracellular vesicles (EVs) have been suggested to play an essential role in several neurological conditions, no prior study has utilized brain organoids to profile EV-derived miRNAs during normal and RTT-affected neuronal development. Here we report the spatiotemporal expression pattern of EV-derived miRNAs in region-specific forebrain organoids generated from female hiPSCs with a MeCP2:R255X mutation and the corresponding isogenic control. EV miRNA and protein expression profiles were characterized at day 0, day 13, day 40, and day 75. Several members of the hsa-miR-302/367 cluster were identified as having a time-dependent expression profile with RTT-specific alterations at the latest developmental stage. Moreover, the miRNA species of the chromosome 14 miRNA cluster (C14MC) exhibited strong upregulation in RTT forebrain organoids irrespective of their spatiotemporal location. Together, our results suggest essential roles of the C14MC and hsa-miR-302/367 clusters in EVs during normal and RTT-associated neurodevelopment, displaying promising prospects as biomarkers for monitoring RTT progression.","Nasim Bahram Sangani, Jarno Koetsier, Ana Rita Gomes, Maria Margarida Diogo, Tiago G Fernandes, Freek G Bouwman, Edwin C M Mariman, Mehrnaz Ghazvini, Joost Gribnau, Leopold M G Curfs, Chris P Reutelingsperger, Lars M T Eijssen",2024
Neural precursor cells rescue symptoms of Rett syndrome by activation of the Interferon γ pathway.,"The beneficial effects of Neural Precursor Cell (NPC) transplantation in several neurological disorders are well established and they are generally mediated by the secretion of immunomodulatory and neurotrophic molecules. We therefore investigated whether Rett syndrome (RTT), that represents the first cause of severe intellectual disability in girls, might benefit from NPC-based therapy. Using in vitro co-cultures, we demonstrate that, by sensing the pathological context, NPC-secreted factors induce the recovery of morphological and synaptic defects typical of Mecp2 deficient neurons. In vivo, we prove that intracerebral transplantation of NPCs in RTT mice significantly ameliorates neurological functions. To uncover the molecular mechanisms underpinning the mediated benefic effects, we analyzed the transcriptional profile of the cerebellum of transplanted animals, disclosing the possible involvement of the Interferon γ (IFNγ) pathway. Accordingly, we report the capacity of IFNγ to rescue synaptic defects, as well as motor and cognitive alterations in Mecp2 deficient models, thereby suggesting this molecular pathway as a potential therapeutic target for RTT.","Angelisa Frasca, Federica Miramondi, Erica Butti, Marzia Indrigo, Maria Balbontin Arenas, Francesca M Postogna, Arianna Piffer, Francesco Bedogni, Lara Pizzamiglio, Clara Cambria, Ugo Borello, Flavia Antonucci, Gianvito Martino, Nicoletta Landsberger",2024
Clinical-grade intranasal NGF fuels neurological and metabolic functions of Mecp2-deficient mice.,"MECP2 deficiency causes a broad spectrum of neuropsychiatric disorders that can affect both genders. Rett syndrome is the most common and is characterized by an apparently normal growth period followed by a regression phase in which patients lose most of their previously acquired skills. After this dramatic period, various symptoms progressively appear, including severe intellectual disability, epilepsy, apraxia, breathing abnormalities and motor deterioration. MECP2 encodes for an epigenetic transcription factor that is particularly abundant in the brain; consequently, several transcriptional defects characterize the Rett syndrome brain. The well-known deficiency of several neurotrophins and growth factors, together with the positive effects exerted by Trofinetide, a synthetic analogue of insulin-like growth factor 1, in Rett patients and in mouse models of Mecp2 deficiency, prompted us to investigate the therapeutic potential of nerve growth factor. Initial in vitro studies demonstrated a healing effect of rhNGF on neuronal maturation and activity in cultured Mecp2-null neurons. Subsequently, we designed in vivo studies with clear translational potential using intranasally administered recombinant human GMP-grade NGF (rhNGF) already used in the clinic. Efficacy of rhNGF in vivo in Mecp2-null hemizygous male mice and heterozygous female mice was assessed. General well-being was evaluated by a conventional phenotypic score and motor performance through the Pole and Beam Walking tests, while cognitive function and interaction with the environment were measured by the Novel Object Recognition Test and the Marble Burying test, respectively. At the end of the treatment, mouse cortices were dissected and bulk RNA sequencing was performed to identify the molecular pathways involved in the protective effects of rhNGF. rhNGF exerted positive effects on cognitive and motor functions in both male and female mouse models of Rett syndrome. In male hemizygous mice, which suffer from significantly more severe and rapidly advancing symptoms, the drug's ability to slow the disease's progression was more pronounced. The unbiased research for the molecular mechanisms triggering the observed benefits revealed a strong positive effect on gene sets related to oxidative phosphorylation, mitochondrial structure and function. These results were validated by demonstrating the drug's ability to improve mitochondrial structure and respiration in Mecp2-null cerebral cortices. Furthermore, GO analyses indicated that NGF exerted the expected improvement in neuronal maturation. We conclude that intranasal administration of rhNGF is a non-invasive and effective route of administration for the treatment of Rett syndrome and possibly for other neurometabolic disorders with overt mitochondrial dysfunction.","Diego Pozzer, Marzia Indrigo, Martina Breccia, Elena Florio, Camilla Aurora Franchino, Giuseppina De Rocco, Francesca Maltecca, Antonio Fadda, Marzia Rossato, Andrea Aramini, Marcello Allegretti, Angelisa Frasca, Lidia De Filippis, Nicoletta Landsberger",2024
Pharmacological inhibition of the CB1 cannabinoid receptor restores abnormal brain mitochondrial CB1 receptor expression and rescues bioenergetic and cognitive defects in a female mouse model of Rett syndrome.,"Defective mitochondria and aberrant brain mitochondrial bioenergetics are consistent features in syndromic intellectual disability disorders, such as Rett syndrome (RTT), a rare neurologic disorder that severely affects mainly females carrying mutations in the X-linked MECP2 gene. A pool of CB1 cannabinoid receptors (CB1R), the primary receptor subtype of the endocannabinoid system in the brain, is located on brain mitochondrial membranes (mtCB1R), where it can locally regulate energy production, synaptic transmission and memory abilities through the inhibition of the intra-mitochondrial protein kinase A (mtPKA). In the present study, we asked whether an overactive mtCB1R-mtPKA signaling might underlie the brain mitochondrial alterations in RTT and whether its modulation by systemic administration of the CB1R inverse agonist rimonabant might improve bioenergetics and cognitive defects in mice modeling RTT.","Livia Cosentino, Chiara Urbinati, Chiara Lanzillotta, Domenico De Rasmo, Daniela Valenti, Mattia Pellas, Maria Cristina Quattrini, Fabiana Piscitelli, Magdalena Kostrzewa, Fabio Di Domenico, Donatella Pietraforte, Tiziana Bisogno, Anna Signorile, Rosa Anna Vacca, Bianca De Filippis",2024
The Kir channel in the nucleus tractus solitarius integrates the chemosensory system with REM sleep executive machinery for homeostatic balance.,"The locus coeruleus (LC), nucleus tractus solitarius (NTS), and retrotrapezoid nucleus (RTN) are critical chemosensory regions in the brainstem. In the LC, acid-sensing ion channels and proton pumps serve as H<sup>+</sup> sensors and facilitate the transition from non-rapid eye movement (NREM) to rapid eye movement (REM) sleep. Interestingly, the potassium inward rectifier (KIR) channels in the LC, NTS, and RTN also act as H<sup>+</sup>-sensors and are a primary target for improving sleep in obstructive sleep apnea and Rett syndrome patients. However, the role of Kir channels in NREM to REM sleep transition for H<sup>+</sup> homeostasis is not known. Male Wistar rats were surgically prepared for chronic sleep-wake recording and drug delivery into the LC, NTS, and RTN. In different animal cohorts, microinjections of the Kir channel inhibitor, barium chloride (BaCl<sub>2</sub>), at concentrations of 1 mM (low dose) and 2 mM (high dose) in the LC and RTN significantly increased wakefulness and decreased NREM sleep. However, BaCl<sub>2</sub> microinjection into the LC notably reduced REM sleep, whereas it didn't change in the RTN-injected group. Interestingly, BaCl<sub>2</sub> microinjections into the NTS significantly decreased wakefulness and increased the percent amount of NREM and REM sleep. Additionally, with the infusion of BaCl<sub>2</sub> into the NTS, the mean REM sleep episode numbers significantly increased, but the length of the REM sleep episode didn't change. These findings suggest that the Kir channels in the NTS, but not in the LC and RTN, modulate state transition from NREM to REM sleep.","Fayaz A Mir, Sushil K Jha",2024
Vglut2-based glutamatergic signaling in central noradrenergic neurons is dispensable for normal breathing and chemosensory reflexes.,"Central noradrenergic (NA) neurons are key constituents of the respiratory homeostatic network. NA dysfunction is implicated in several developmental respiratory disorders including Congenital Central Hyperventilation Syndrome (CCHS), Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS), and Rett Syndrome. The current unchallenged paradigm in the field, supported by multiple studies, is that glutamate co-transmission in subsets of central NA neurons plays a role in breathing control. If true, NA-glutamate co-transmission may also be mechanistically important in respiratory disorders. However, the requirement of NA-derived glutamate in breathing has not been directly tested and the extent of glutamate co-transmission in the central NA system remains uncharacterized. Therefore, we fully characterized the cumulative fate maps and acute adult expression patterns of all three vesicular glutamate transporters (<i>Slc17a7</i> (Vglut1), <i>Slc17a6</i> (Vglut2), and <i>Slc17a8</i> (Vglut3)) in NA neurons, identifying a novel, dynamic expression pattern for Vglut2 and an undescribed co-expression domain for Vglut3 in the NA system. In contrast to our initial hypothesis that NA-derived glutamate is required to breathing, our functional studies showed that loss of Vglut2 throughout the NA system failed to alter breathing or metabolism under room air, hypercapnia, or hypoxia in unrestrained and unanesthetized mice. These data demonstrate that Vglut2-based glutamatergic signaling within the central NA system is not required for normal baseline breathing and hypercapnic, hypoxic chemosensory reflexes. These outcomes challenge the current understanding of central NA neurons in the control of breathing and suggests that glutamate may not be a critical target to understand NA neuron dysfunction in respiratory diseases.","Yuan Chang, Savannah Lusk, Andersen Chang, Christopher S Ward, Russell S Ray",2024
Modeling antisense oligonucleotide therapy in MECP2 duplication syndrome human iPSC-derived neurons reveals gene expression programs responsive to MeCP2 levels.,"Genomic copy-number variations (CNVs) that can cause neurodevelopmental disorders often encompass many genes, which complicates our understanding of how individual genes within a CNV contribute to pathology. MECP2 duplication syndrome (MDS or MRXSL in OMIM; OMIM#300260) is one such CNV disorder caused by duplications spanning methyl CpG-binding protein 2 (MECP2) and other genes on Xq28. Using an antisense oligonucleotide (ASO) to normalize MECP2 dosage is sufficient to rescue abnormal neurological phenotypes in mouse models overexpressing MECP2 alone, implicating the importance of increased MECP2 dosage within CNVs of Xq28. However, because MDS CNVs span MECP2 and additional genes, we generated human neurons from multiple MDS patient-derived induced pluripotent cells (iPSCs) to evaluate the benefit of using an ASO against MECP2 in a MDS human neuronal context. Importantly, we identified a signature of genes that is partially and qualitatively modulated upon ASO treatment, pinpointed genes sensitive to MeCP2 function, and altered in a model of Rett syndrome, a neurological disorder caused by loss of MeCP2 function. Furthermore, the signature contained genes that are aberrantly altered in unaffected control human neurons upon MeCP2 depletion, revealing gene expression programs qualitatively sensitive to MeCP2 levels in human neurons. Lastly, ASO treatment led to a partial rescue of abnormal neuronal morphology in MDS neurons. All together, these data demonstrate that ASOs targeting MECP2 benefit human MDS neurons. Moreover, our study establishes a paradigm by which to evaluate the contribution of individual genes within a CNV to pathogenesis and to assess their potential as a therapeutic target.","Sameer S Bajikar, Yehezkel Sztainberg, Alexander J Trostle, Harini P Tirumala, Ying-Wooi Wan, Caroline L Harrop, Jesse D Bengtsson, Claudia M B Carvalho, Davut Pehlivan, Bernhard Suter, Jeffrey L Neul, Zhandong Liu, Paymaan Jafar-Nejad, Frank Rigo, Huda Y Zoghbi",2024

MeCP2 Deficiency Alters the Response Selectivity of Prefrontal Cortical Neurons to Different Social Stimuli.,"Rett syndrome (RTT), a severe neurodevelopmental disorder caused by mutations in the MeCP2 gene, is characterized by cognitive and social deficits. Previous studies have noted hypoactivity in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) pyramidal neurons of MeCP2-deficient mice (RTT mice) in response to both social and nonsocial stimuli. To further understand the neural mechanisms behind the social deficits of RTT mice, we monitored excitatory pyramidal neurons in the prelimbic region of the mPFC during social interactions in mice. These neurons' activity was closely linked to social preference, especially in wild-type mice. However, RTT mice showed reduced social interest and corresponding hypoactivity in these neurons, indicating that impaired mPFC activity contributes to their social deficits. We identified six mPFC neural ensembles selectively tuned to various stimuli, with RTT mice recruiting fewer neurons to ensembles responsive to social interactions and consistently showing lower stimulus-ON ensemble transient rates. Despite these lower rates, RTT mice exhibited an increase in the percentage of social-ON neurons in later sessions, suggesting a compensatory mechanism for the decreased firing rate. This highlights the limited plasticity in the mPFC caused by MeCP2 deficiency and offers insights into the neural dynamics of social encoding. The presence of multifunctional neurons and those specifically responsive to social or object stimuli in the mPFC emphasizes its crucial role in complex behaviors and cognitive functions, with selective neuron engagement suggesting efficiency in neural activation that optimizes responses to environmental stimuli.","Natalie Boyle, Yipeng Li, Xiaoqian Sun, Pan Xu, Chien-Hsien Lai, Sarah Betts, Dian Guo, Rahul Simha, Chen Zeng, Jianyang Du, Hui Lu",2024
Integrating DIA Single-Cell Proteomics Data with the DiagnoMass Proteomic Hub for Biological Insights.,"Single-cell proteomics has emerged as a powerful technology for unraveling the complexities of cellular heterogeneity, enabling insights into individual cell functions and pathologies. One of the primary challenges in single-cell proteomics is data generation, where low mass spectral signals often preclude the triggering of MS2 events. This challenge is addressed by Data Independent Acquisition (DIA), a data acquisition strategy that does not depend on peptide ion isotopic signatures to generate an MS2 event. In this study, we present data generated from the integration of DIA single-cell proteomics with a version of the DiagnoMass Proteomic Hub that was adapted to handle DIA data. DiagnoMass employs a hierarchical clustering methodology that enables the identification of tandem mass spectral clusters that are discriminative of biological conditions, thereby reducing the reliance on search engine biases for identifications. Nevertheless, a search engine (in this work, DIA-NN) can be integrated with DiagnoMass for spectral annotation. We used single-cell proteomic data from iPSC-derived neuroprogenitor cell cultures as a test study of this integrated approach. We were able to differentiate between control and Rett Syndrome patient cells to discern the proteomic variances potentially contributing to the disease's pathology. Our research confirms that the DiagnoMass-DIA synergy significantly enhances the identification of discriminative proteomic signatures, highlighting critical biological variations such as the presence of unique spectra that could be related to Rett Syndrome pathology.","Aline M A Martins, Marlon D M Santos, Amanda C Camillo-Andrade, Aline Lima Leite, Janaina Sena Souza, Sandra Sánchez, Alysson R Muotri, Paulo Costa Carvalho, John R Yates",2024
