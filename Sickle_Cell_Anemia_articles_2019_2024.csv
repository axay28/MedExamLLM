Changes in indicators of cerebral metabolic stress following treatment with voxelotor in children and adolescents with sickle cell anemia.,"Voxelotor is a small molecule that reduces the polymerization of sickle hemoglobin by increasing its affinity for oxygen. In patients with sickle cell anemia, it has been postulated that increasing hemoglobin-oxygen affinity could limit oxygen offloading from hemoglobin, causing an increase in cerebral metabolic stress. To investigate this hypothetical concern, we used multimodal brain imaging to define the effects of voxelotor on cerebral blood flow and oxygen extraction. We followed four patients for 2-5 months during and/or after voxelotor therapy. This study showed no observable increase in cerebral blood flow or oxygen extraction fraction during treatment.","Andrew M Heitzer, Ping Zou, Jason Hodges, Clark Brown, Mark Davis, Sandy Dixon, Robert J Ogg, Jeremie Estepp, Jane S Hankins, Ranganatha Sitaram, Clifford M Takemoto",2024
"Prevalence and associated risk factors of myocardial ischemia in children living with sickle cell anemia in Lagos, Nigeria.","Myocardial ischemia (MI) in children living with sickle cell anemia (SCA) is rarely reported. MI among children living with this disease could portend untoward outcomes on their quality of life and survival. This study evaluated the prevalence and associated risk factors of MI in children living with SCA during a vaso-occlusive crisis (VOC) compared with those with SCA who had no symptoms nor an MI in the past (those in ""steady state"") in Lagos, Nigeria. This comparative cross-sectional study was conducted over 10 months (between March and December 2019) among 250 children living with SCA aged 6 months-18 years (125 in VOC and 125 age and sex-matched controls in steady state). The assessment of MI was determined by measuring cardiac troponin T (cTnT) and electrocardiography (ECG). The prevalence of MI measuring cTnT alone in children with SCA during VOC and steady state was 42.4% and 23.2%, respectively. Comparatively, measuring ECG alone, the prevalence of MI in VOC and steady state was 40.8% and 20.8%, respectively. The prevalence of MI measuring cTnT and ECG in children with SCA in VOC and steady state was 38.4% and 20%, respectively. Older age, severity of pain, longer duration of illness, frequent crises per year, elevated white blood cells, and platelet count were significantly associated with MI in participants with SCA. However, with multivariate analysis, age, severity of pain, and elevated platelet counts remained significantly associated with the occurrence of MI. This study affirms the high prevalence of MI in children with SCA irrespective of the diagnostic criteria. Routine evaluation should be done in this cohort to avert MI-associated sequelae.","Oluwatoyin Adeniyi, Abideen Salako, Ogochukwu Sokunbi, Oluwatosin Odubela, Oladapo Aworanti, Christy Okoromah, Adebola Akinsulie",2024
Opioid Control for Patients With Sickle Cell Anemia in Emergency Departments in the Western Region of Saudi Arabia.,"Introduction Sickle cell anemia (SCA) affects the Saudi Arabian population significantly, with 4.2% carriers and 0.26% affected. Vaso-occlusive crises cause severe pain due to blood vessel blockage by sickled cells, leading to frequent emergency visits, where treatment includes the use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), oxygen, and opioids. This study examines opioid use in managing SCA crises in Saudi emergency departments. Method A retrospective cross-sectional study in western Saudi Arabia surveyed board-certified emergency physicians (consultants, fellows, specialists) via the Sickle Cell Disease Implementation Consortium (SCDIC). Non-board-certified physicians and general practitioners were excluded. Data were gathered through structured surveys and supplemented by interviews. Results The study included 53 emergency physicians, mostly specialists (60.4%), with one to three years' experience, primarily from King Abdul Aziz University Hospital (28.3%) and King Abdullah Medical Complex (22.6%). While more than half of the participants felt adequately trained for SCA management, 20.8% faced challenges referring patients to case management programs. Major barriers included department overcrowding and the opioid epidemic. Conclusion The study reveals challenges in managing SCA in Saudi emergency departments, particularly with opioid use. Despite physician training, gaps in administrative support, medication access, and follow-up care persist. Institutional policies and opioid epidemic concerns restrict Schedule-II opioid prescriptions. Implementing a comprehensive opioid administration tracking system and standardizing protocols are crucial for enhancing patient outcomes. Future efforts should focus on improving resources and inter-institutional collaboration.","Mansoor Radwi, Wisam Jamal, Abrar A Aljubayri, Abdulrahman S Hassan, Haitham S Alamri, Osama A Alraddadi, Saeed Alghamdi, Abdualrahman T Alashari, Hisham A Rizk",2024
mARC1 Is the Main Contributor to Metabolic Reduction of <i>N</i>-Hydroxyurea.,"<i>N</i>-Hydroxyurea has been known since the 1960s as an antiproliferative drug and is used both in oncology and for treatment of hematological disorders such as sickle cell anemia where very high daily doses are administered. It is assumed that the cellular effect of <i>N</i>-hydroxyurea is caused by inhibition of ribonucleotide reductase, while alternative mechanisms, e.g., generation of nitric oxide, have also been proposed. Despite its many therapeutic applications, the metabolism of hydroxyurea is largely unexplored. The major elimination pathway of <i>N</i>-hydroxyurea is the reduction to urea. Since the mitochondrial amidoxime reducing component (mARC) is known for its <i>N</i>-reductive activity, we investigated the reduction of NHU by this enzyme system. This study presents <i>in vitro</i> and <i>in vivo</i> evidence that this reductive biotransformation is specifically mediated by the mARC1. Inactivation by mARC1 is a possible explanation for the high doses of NHU required for treatment.","Cathrin Klopp, Xiaomei Zhang, Morgan K Campbell, David Kvaskoff, Michel A Struwe, Curtis R Warren, Besnik Bajrami, Axel J Scheidig, Amanda K Jones, Bernd Clement",2024
The Association Between Sickle Cell Anemia and Cognitive Dysfunction: A Systematic Review.,"A kind of hemoglobinopathy known as sickle cell anemia (SCA) is characterized by aberrant hemoglobin molecules. The most frequent neurological side effects linked to SCA include neurocognitive dysfunction, asymptomatic cerebral infarction, and ischemic stroke. This study aims to investigate the relationship between SCA and cognitive dysfunction. We systematically searched electronic databases like PubMed, MEDLINE, Science Direct, and Scopus. Two independent reviewers screened and extracted data from eligible studies. Eighteen studies, including 2,457 participants in total and nearly half of them 1,151 (46.8%) were males, were included in our data. The prevalence of cognitive dysfunction in the adult population ranged from 11.5% to 70%. Cognitive dysfunction among adults was significantly associated with poorer educational status, reduced family income, decreased kidney function, older age, stroke history, and vasculopathy. The prevalence of cognitive dysfunction in children ranged from 10.2% to 68.2%. The decline in cognitive function among adults was significantly associated with children over the age of four, abnormal transcranial Doppler and previous stroke, school absence, age beyond 13, and increased BMI. Cognitive function deficiencies are a defining feature of SCA that affects people of all ages. These findings suggest that if cognitive decline is not slowed down, or better still, stopped, medical interventions targeting a variety of sequelae in this population will be ineffective. Future analyses of this population's cognition should evaluate the environmental and other biological variables.","Mohammed Alpakra, Nazim F Hamed, Zainab E Almakki, Esmaeel Al Bakrah",2024
Nitrosyl hemoglobin formation from nitrite in normal and sickle blood.,"Sickle cell anemia is caused by a single mutation in the gene encoding the beta subunit of hemoglobin. Due to this mutation, sickle cell hemoglobin (HbS) polymerizes under hypoxic conditions, decreasing red blood cell deformability and leading to multiple pathological effects that cause substantial morbidity and mortality. Several pre-clinical and human studies have demonstrated that the anion nitrite has potential therapeutic benefits for patients with sickle cell disease. Nitrite is reduced to nitric oxide (NO) by deoxygenated hemoglobin contributing to vasodilation, decreasing platelet activation, decreasing cellular adhesion to activated endothelium, and decreasing red cell hemolysis; all of which could ameliorate patient morbidities. Previous work on extracellular hemoglobin has shown that solution phase HbS reduces nitrite to NO faster than normal adult hemoglobin (HbA), while polymerized HbS reduces nitrite slower than HbA. In this work, we compared the rate of nitrite reduction to NO measured by the formation of nitrosyl hemoglobin in sickle and normal red blood cells at varying hemoglobin oxygen saturations. We found the overall rate of nitrite reduction between normal and sickle red blood cells was similar and confirmed this result under partially oxygenated conditions, but normal red blood cells reduced nitrite faster than sickle red blood cells under anoxia where HbS polymerization is maximal. These results are consistent with previous work using extracellular hemoglobin where the rate of reduction by solution phase HbS makes up for the slower reduction by polymer phase HbS under partially oxygenated conditions, but the polymer phase kinetics dominates in the complete absence of oxygen.","Laxman Poudel, Elmira Alipour, Silvie Suriany, Honglei Liu, Stephen R Baker, Thilini Karunarathna, Alex George, Jon Detterich, Daniel B Kim-Shapiro",2024
Delivery Aspects for Implementing siRNA Therapeutics for Blood Diseases.,"Hematological disorders result in significant health consequences, and traditional therapies frequently entail adverse reactions without addressing the root cause. A potential solution for hematological disorders characterized by gain-of-function mutations lies in the emergence of small interfering RNA (siRNA) molecules as a therapeutic option. siRNAs are a class of RNA molecules composed of double-stranded RNAs that can degrade specific mRNAs, thereby inhibiting the synthesis of underlying disease proteins. Therapeutic interventions utilizing siRNA can be tailored to selectively target genes implicated in diverse hematological disorders, including sickle cell anemia, β-thalassemia, and malignancies such as lymphoma, myeloma, and leukemia. The development of efficient siRNA silencers necessitates meticulous contemplation of variables such as the RNA backbone, stability, and specificity. Transportation of siRNA to specific cells poses a significant hurdle, prompting investigations of diverse delivery approaches, including chemically modified forms of siRNA and nanoparticle formulations with various biocompatible carriers. This review delves into the crucial role of siRNA technology in targeting and treating hematological malignancies and disorders. It sheds light on the latest research, development, and clinical trials, detailing how various pharmaceutical approaches leverage siRNA against blood disorders, mainly concentrating on cancers. It outlines the preferred molecular targets and physiological barriers to delivery while emphasizing the growing potential of various therapeutic delivery methods. The need for further research is articulated in the context of overcoming the shortcomings of siRNA in order to enrich discussions around siRNA's role in managing blood disorders and aiding the scientific community in advancing more targeted and effective treatments.","Saba Abbasi Dezfouli, Marcel E Michailides, Hasan Uludag",2024

Metabolic profile characterization of voxelotor in human urine based on in vivo and in vitro models for doping control.,"Voxelotor was approved for the treatment of sickle cell anemia as a potent hemoglobin S polymerization inhibitor. Owing to its ability to affect blood components and its potential to enhance athletic performance, voxelotor was included in the prohibited list issued by the World Anti-Doping Agency in 2023, banning its use both in and out of competition. This study aimed to comprehensively investigate the metabolic profile of voxelotor in human urine and identify suitable metabolites for long-term analytical retrospectivity in doping control. A novel strategy for metabolite identification was established by combining in vivo human administration with isotope labeling-based in vitro metabolism analysis. A single microdose of voxelotor was administered orally to five volunteers, and urine samples were collected for up to 28 days post-administration. Concurrently, in vitro incubation of human liver microsomes with voxelotor and D3-voxelotor was conducted, and the microsomal incubates were analyzed via liquid chromatography-high-resolution mass spectrometry. Targeted metabolite searches in human urine samples and automated nontargeted screening of isotope metabolite ion pairs in incubation samples led to the discovery of 9 phase I metabolites and 23 phase II metabolites. Analysis of the urine excretion curves revealed that 4 metabolites, along with voxelotor, were suitable for long-term anti-doping monitoring, with a detection window exceeding 20 days. Using both in vivo and in vitro metabolic models, this study provides comprehensive insight into the metabolic profile of voxelotor in human urine for the first time, enhancing the capacity for doping screening and extending the retrospectivity of voxelotor detection.","Xueqi Liang, Tian Tian, Ziling Zheng, Hao Geng, Yuanhong Shan, Xiaojun Deng",2024
"Sickle cell anaemia control mission: Implementation of a comprehensive care model in Anuppur, Madhya Pradesh.","Background & objectives Sickle cell disease (SCD) is a common genetic disorder, predominantly found in the tribal population of India. The examples of models providing comprehensive care and management to individuals with SCD in public health facilities are sparse. The Sickle Cell Anaemia Control Mission is one such model implemented by Jan Swasthya Sahyog, a non-profit organization in collaboration with the National Health Mission in the Anuppur district of Madhya Pradesh. This article aimed to identify the key learnings from this programme that can guide the public health system strengthening with respect to SCD. Methods The Sickle Cell Anemia Control Mission Programme included door to door screening for anaemia, SCD and blood group. SCD cases were included in the programme and other individuals with Anemia were referred for further care. Care for individuals with SCD included counselling, provision of hydroxyurea, regular follow up of clinical parameters and management of complications. Care for individuals with SCD was provided through monthly patient support group (PSG) meetings and regular outpatient /in-patient care at public health facilities. Quantitative data on programme design, screening and patient management collected during programme implementation were used for analysis. Results A total of 39421 persons were screened in 18 months (August 2018-March 2020). Of these 81.9 per cent persons were anaemic, 16.9 per cent had sickle cell trait and 779 (1.98%) had SCD. Eighty-six already diagnosed individuals joined the programme for care. People from all caste categories were diagnosed with SCD. Out of 865 individuals with SCD, 157 underwent regular 9-11 months follow up and showed improvement in clinical symptoms and drug compliance. Interpretation & conclusions Central India has a significant burden of anaemia and SCD. This study found that SCD is present in non-tribals as well. PSGs are an efficient way to deliver non-emergency care for chronic diseases such as SCD.",N/A,N/A
Advancing life: innovative approaches to enhance survival in sickle cell anemia patients.,"Sickle cell anemia (SCA) is a severe genetic disorder characterized by the production of abnormal hemoglobin S, leading to the formation of sickle-shaped red blood cells that cause chronic anemia, pain, and organ damage. This review explores recent innovative strategies aimed at improving survival rates and quality of life for SCA patients. Genetic therapies, particularly gene editing with CRISPR-Cas9 and gene therapy using lentiviral vectors, have shown significant potential in correcting the genetic defects responsible for SCA. Clinical trials demonstrate that these approaches can reduce sickle cell crises and minimize the need for blood transfusions by enabling the production of healthy red blood cells. Novel pharmacological treatments such as voxelotor, crizanlizumab, and L-glutamine provide additional mechanisms to prevent hemoglobin polymerization, reduce vaso-occlusive episodes, and decrease oxidative stress, respectively. These therapies offer new hope for patients, particularly those who do not respond adequately to existing treatments. Improved blood transfusion protocols, including automated red cell exchange and advanced donor-matching techniques, have enhanced the safety and efficacy of transfusions, reducing complications like alloimmunization. Comprehensive care models, integrating multidisciplinary care teams, patient education, and telemedicine, have further contributed to better disease management. By providing holistic care that addresses both medical and psychosocial needs, these models improve patient adherence to treatment and overall health outcomes. This review highlights the importance of these innovative strategies and calls for continued research and development to sustain and expand these advancements in SCA care.","Emmanuel Ifeanyi Obeagu, Teddy Charles Adias, Getrude Uzoma Obeagu",2024
Potassium dynamics in sickle cell anemia: clinical implications and pathophysiological insights.,"Potassium dynamics are critical in the pathophysiology of sickle cell anemia (SCA), a genetic disorder characterized by the presence of abnormally shaped red blood cells that lead to various complications such as vaso-occlusive crises and hemolytic anemia. This review focuses on the clinical implications and pathophysiological insights of potassium regulation in SCA, highlighting its impact on disease progression and potential therapeutic strategies. The dysregulation of potassium transport in SCA leads to significant K+ efflux and cellular dehydration, exacerbating the sickling process. Dehydrated sickle cells, due to potassium loss, become more rigid and prone to causing blockages in small blood vessels, leading to painful vaso-occlusive crises and ischemia. Furthermore, chronic hemolysis in SCA, aggravated by potassium imbalance, contributes to severe anemia and systemic complications. These insights underscore the importance of maintaining potassium homeostasis to mitigate disease severity and improve patient outcomes. Therapeutic strategies targeting potassium regulation show promise in managing SCA. Inhibitors of the Gardos channel, such as senicapoc, have demonstrated potential in reducing sickling and hemolysis. Additionally, hydration therapy plays a crucial role in maintaining electrolyte balance and preventing RBC dehydration. A comprehensive approach that includes monitoring and correcting electrolyte imbalances, along with standard treatments like hydroxyurea and blood transfusions, is essential for effective disease management.",Emmanuel Ifeanyi Obeagu,2024
Novel single-cell measurements suggest irreversibly sickled cells are neither dense nor dehydrated.,"In sickle cell anemia, deoxygenation causes erythrocytes to distort, while reoxygenation permits them to recover a normal biconcave disk shape. Irreversibly sickled cells (ISCs) remain distorted when reoxygenated and have been thought to have among the highest intracellular hemoglobin concentrations of the sickle red cell population and therefore the greatest vulnerability to vasoocclusion. Using a new optical method, which we describe, we have made precise measurements of the intracellular hemoglobin concentration, and intracellular O<sub>2</sub> saturation, of ISCs, as well as oxygenated sickle cells with a normal biconcave disc shape, and cells with shapes distorted by the sickle fibers they contain. This method also provides good estimates of cell volumes, and hemoglobin per red cell. The concentration distribution of the ISCs is found to be similar to normal, discoid cells. Average ISC volumes exceed their discoid counterparts, with a much broader distribution, arguing against dehydration as their origin. The concentration distribution of the polymer-laden sickled cells is significantly higher in mean value, and their volume distributions indicate some dehydration. Previous assumptions about ISCs may have thus been colored by the presence of sickle cells that did contain polymer, and true ISCs may be much more benign than once thought, which underscores the importance of accurate measurement on individual cells. This method could be used to follow changes in individual cell properties under various specific perturbations, and where characterization by flow cytometry is infeasible.","Thomas J Reese, Eli H Worth, Mark K Fugate, M T Levitt, Frank A Ferrone",2024
Impaired microvascular function in patients with sickle cell anemia and leg ulcers improved with healing.,"Leg Ulcer (LU) pathophysiology is still not well understood in sickle cell anaemia (SCA). We hypothesised that SCA patients with LU would be characterised by lower microvascular reactivity. The aim of the present study was to compare the microcirculatory function (transcutaneous oxygen pressure (TcPO<sub>2</sub>) on the foot and laser Doppler flowmetry on the arm) and several blood biological parameters between nine SCA patients with active LU (LU+) and 56 SCA patients with no positive history of LU (LU-). We also tested the effects of plasma from LU+ and LU- patients on endothelial cell activation. We observed a reduction of the TcPO<sub>2</sub> in LU+ compared to LU- patients. In addition, LU+ patients exhibited lower cutaneous microvascular vasodilatory capacity in response to acetylcholine, current and local heating compared to LU- patients. Inflammation and endothelial cell activation in response to plasma did not differ between the two groups. Among the nine patients from the LU+ group, eight were followed and six achieved healing in 4.4 ± 2.5 months. Among thus achieving healing, microvascular vasodilatory capacity in response to acetylcholine, current and local heating and TcPO<sub>2</sub> improved after healing. In conclusion, microcirculatory function is impaired in patients with LU, and improves with healing.","Judith Catella, Etienne Turpin, Philippe Connes, Elie Nader, Romain Carin, Marie Martin, Hamdi Rezigue, Christophe Nougier, Yesim Dargaud, Audrey Josset-Lamaugarny, Justine Dugrain, Muriel Marano, Alexandre Leuci, Camille Boisson, Celine Renoux, Philippe Joly, Solène Poutrel, Arnaud Hot, Nicolas Guillot, Berengère Fromy",2024

Immunization strategies for individuals with sickle cell anemia: A narrative review.,"Sickle cell anemia (SCA) is a hereditary blood disorder characterized by the production of abnormal hemoglobin, leading to the formation of sickle-shaped red blood cells. These distorted cells can obstruct blood flow, causing vaso-occlusive crises and increasing the risk of severe infections due to functional asplenia and immune system dysregulation. Immunization is a crucial strategy to mitigate infection-related complications in individuals with SCA, necessitating a comprehensive and tailored vaccination approach. Current immunization guidelines for individuals with SCA recommend a combination of standard and additional vaccines to address their heightened susceptibility to infections. Key vaccines include pneumococcal conjugate (PCV13) and polysaccharide (PPSV23) vaccines, meningococcal conjugate (MenACWY) and serogroup B (MenB) vaccines, Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib) vaccine, annual influenza vaccine, and hepatitis A and B vaccines. These vaccinations aim to provide broad protection against pathogens that pose significant risks to patients with SCA. Despite generally adequate immune responses, the variability in vaccine efficacy due to immune dysfunction necessitates booster doses and additional vaccinations. This narrative review highlights the importance of adhering to current immunization recommendations and addresses challenges such as access to care, vaccine hesitancy, and monitoring vaccination status.","Emmanuel Ifeanyi Obeagu, Getrude Uzoma Obeagu",2024

As parents/caregivers hold primary disease management responsibility during childhood, their involvement in disease management activities, including medical decision-making, is critical to successful and timely management of pediatric SCD. However, the processes through which caregivers make SCD-related decisions remain unknown. The current paper examined caregivers' decision-making processes and priorities when managing their child's SCD.","Ariel O Blakey, Christina M Amaro, Jenna Sandler Eilenberg, Annelise Brochier, Patricia L Kavanagh, Arvin Garg, Mari-Lynn Drainoni, Kristin Long",2024
Therapeutic Gene Editing for Hemoglobinopathies.,"In the last ten years, a consistent number of clinical studies have evaluated different gene approaches for the treatment of patients with sickle cell disease (SCD) and transfusion-dependent β-thalassemia (TDT). Initial studies of gene therapy for hemoglobinopathies involved the use of lentiviral vectors to add functional copies of the gene encoding β-globin in defective CD34 cells; more recently, gene editing techniques have been used involving either CRISPR-Cas9, transcription activation-like effector protein nuclease, zinc finger nuclease, and base editing to either induce fetal hemoglobin production at therapeutic levels or to genetically repair the underlying molecular defect causing the disease. Here, we review recent gene editing studies that have started the development of a new era in the treatment of hemoglobinopathies and, in general, monoallelic hereditary diseases.","Ugo Testa, Giuseppe Leone, Maria Domenica Cappellini",2024
Global awareness of antigenic peptides - Unraveling the impact on sickle cell anemia patients in the presence of pathogens: A narrative review.,"Sickle cell anemia (SCA) is a genetic blood disorder characterized by the production of abnormal hemoglobin S (HbS), leading to sickle-shaped red blood cells and various complications, including increased susceptibility to infections. The presence of antigenic peptides, short amino acid sequences derived from pathogens or altered self-proteins, plays a crucial role in immune responses. This review explores the global awareness of antigenic peptides, their role in immune responses in SCA patients, and the challenges and opportunities in managing infections within this vulnerable population. Antigenic peptides are central to the adaptive immune response, facilitating the recognition and elimination of pathogens by T-cells. In SCA, altered antigen presentation and impaired T-cell responses due to chronic inflammation, functional asplenia, and ongoing hemolysis contribute to increased susceptibility to infections. Pathogens such as Streptococcus pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae pose significant risks to SCA patients, highlighting the importance of robust immune responses mediated by antigenic peptides. Strategies such as vaccination and immunotherapy aim to enhance immune function by targeting specific antigenic peptides, thereby reducing infection rates and improving patient outcomes. Advances in genomics and proteomics offer insights into individual variations in antigen presentation and immune responses, guiding the development of tailored therapeutic interventions. Global collaborations are essential to address disparities in healthcare access and implement effective preventive measures, ensuring equitable outcomes for SCA patients worldwide.",Emmanuel Ifeanyi Obeagu,2024
