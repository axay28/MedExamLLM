Efficacy and safety of gene therapy with onasemnogene abeparvovec in children with spinal muscular atrophy in the D-A-CH-region: a population-based observational study.,"Real-world data on gene addition therapy (GAT) with onasemnogene abeparvovec (OA), including all age groups and with or without symptoms of the disease before treatment are needed to provide families with evidence-based advice and realistic therapeutic goals. Aim of this study is therefore a population-based analysis of all patients with SMA treated with OA across Germany, Austria and Switzerland (D-A-CH).","Claudia Weiß, Lena-Luise Becker, Johannes Friese, Astrid Blaschek, Andreas Hahn, Sabine Illsinger, Oliver Schwartz, Günther Bernert, Maja von der Hagen, Ralf A Husain, Klaus Goldhahn, Janbernd Kirschner, Astrid Pechmann, Marina Flotats-Bastardas, Gudrun Schreiber, Ulrike Schara, Barbara Plecko, Regina Trollmann, Veronka Horber, Ekkehard Wilichowski, Matthias Baumann, Andrea Klein, Astrid Eisenkölbl, Cornelia Köhler, Georg M Stettner, Sebahattin Cirak, Oswald Hasselmann, Angela M Kaindl, Sven F Garbade, Jessika Johannsen, Andreas Ziegler",2024
Treatment preferences in spinal muscular atrophy: A swing weighting study for caregivers of patients with SMA types 1 and 2.,"Spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) is a genetic neuromuscular disorder characterized by skeletal muscle weakness and atrophy. Patients with SMA types 1 and 2 develop severe disabilities conferring substantial patient and caregiver burden. Caregiver treatment characteristic preferences are useful for informing treatment choices and improving adherence. We aimed to identify drivers of SMA treatment preference from the perspective of caregivers of patients with SMA types 1 or 2 in the United States. We quantified the relative importance of different treatment characteristics and compared preferences for hypothetical treatment scenarios. Treatment attributes and attribute levels elicited were based on a literature search and interviews with caregivers and health care professionals. The most important treatment characteristics from the perspective of health care professionals and caregivers were identified and used in a survey to quantify relative importance for caregivers. Caregivers completed surveys regarding their preferences using swing weighting methodology. These results were used to estimate the relative value of four hypothetical SMA treatment scenarios exploring different modes of treatment administration. The swing weighting survey, completed by 20 caregivers, demonstrated that the attributes driving treatment preference were reduction in permanent ventilation needs and risk of severe adverse events, followed by treatment access (including cost coverage and availability), increased ability to sit without support, and less treatment administration burden. The hypothetical SMA treatment scenarios with the highest relative value offered an easier mode of administration, lowest risk of severe adverse events, less need of permanent ventilation, and highest ability of patients to feed and sit without support. Our findings suggest that caregivers prefer a treatment with reduced clinical burden and risk in which the cost is covered and treatment is available in the short term. These results can provide important contextual information for decision-makers and help promote patient-centered care for patients with SMA.","Anish Patel, Walter Toro, Siobhan Bourke, Yemi Oluboyede, Sylvaine Barbier, Nataliya Bogoeva, Sandra P Reyna, Omar Dabbous",2024

Experiences and the psychosocial situation of parental caregivers of children with spinal muscular atrophy against the background of new treatment options: a qualitative interview study.,"Spinal muscular atrophy is a rare neurodegenerative disorder in children which leads untreated to muscle wasting, respiratory impairments, and a shortened life expectancy. Parents as primary caregivers are often physically and psychologically burdened. In recent years, new and promising treatment options have been approved, but it remains unclear if they have an impact on the psychosocial situation of affected families.","Maja Brandt, Joenna Driemeyer, Jessika Johannsen, Jonas Denecke, Laura Inhestern, Corinna Bergelt",2024
Sm-site containing mRNAs can accept Sm-rings and are downregulated in Spinal Muscular Atrophy.,"Sm-ring assembly is important for the biogenesis, stability, and function of uridine-rich small nuclear RNAs (U snRNAs) involved in pre-mRNA splicing and histone pre-mRNA processing. Sm-ring assembly is cytoplasmic and dependent upon the Sm-site sequence and structural motif, ATP, and <i>Survival motor neuron</i> (SMN) protein complex. While RNAs other than U snRNAs were previously shown to associate with Sm proteins, whether this association follows Sm-ring assembly requirements is unknown. We systematically identified Sm-sites within the human and mouse transcriptomes and assessed whether these sites can accept Sm-rings. In addition to snRNAs, Sm-sites are highly prevalent in the 3' untranslated regions of long messenger RNAs. RNA immunoprecipitation experiments confirm that Sm-site containing mRNAs associate with Sm proteins in the cytoplasm. In modified Sm-ring assembly assays, Sm-site containing RNAs, from either bulk polyadenylated RNAs or those transcribed <i>in vitro</i> , specifically associate with Sm proteins in an Sm-site and ATP-dependent manner. In cell and animal models of Spinal Muscular Atrophy (SMA), mRNAs containing Sm-sites are downregulated, suggesting reduced Sm-ring assembly on these mRNAs may contribute to SMA pathogenesis. Together, this study establishes that Sm-site containing mRNAs can accept Sm-rings and identifies a novel mechanism for Sm proteins in regulation of cytoplasmic mRNAs.","Anton J Blatnik, Manu Sanjeev, Jacob Slivka, Benjamin Pastore, Caleb M Embree, Wen Tang, Guramrit Singh, Arthur H M Burghes",2024

Taldefgrobep Alfa and the Phase 3 RESILIENT Trial in Spinal Muscular Atrophy.,"Spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) is a rare, genetic neurodegenerative disorder caused by insufficient production of survival motor neuron (SMN) protein. Diminished SMN protein levels lead to motor neuron loss, causing muscle atrophy and weakness that impairs daily functioning and reduces quality of life. SMN upregulators offer clinical improvements and increased survival in SMA patients, although significant unmet needs remain. Myostatin, a TGF-β superfamily signaling molecule that binds to the activin II receptor, negatively regulates muscle growth; myostatin inhibition is a promising therapeutic strategy for enhancing muscle. Combining myostatin inhibition with SMN upregulation, a comprehensive therapeutic strategy targeting the whole motor unit, offers promise in SMA. Taldefgrobep alfa is a novel, fully human recombinant protein that selectively binds to myostatin and competitively inhibits other ligands that signal through the activin II receptor. Given a robust scientific and clinical rationale and the favorable safety profile of taldefgrobep in patients with neuromuscular disease, the RESILIENT phase 3, randomized, placebo-controlled trial is investigating taldefgrobep as an adjunct to SMN upregulators in SMA (NCT05337553). This manuscript reviews the role of myostatin in muscle, explores the preclinical and clinical development of taldefgrobep and introduces the phase 3 RESILIENT trial of taldefgrobep in SMA.","Laurent Servais, Lindsey Lee Lair, Anne M Connolly, Barry J Byrne, Karen S Chen, Vlad Coric, Irfan Qureshi, Susan Durham, Daniel J Campbell, Grant Maclaine, Jackie Marin, Clifford Bechtold",2024
Oral functions in adult persons with spinal muscular atrophy compared to a healthy control group: a prospective cross-sectional study with a multimodal approach.,"Oral function tests have been shown to reliably detect impaired bulbar function in adults with spinal muscular atrophy (SMA). Although not routinely recorded, it is known that persons with SMA are affected to varying degrees. Detecting differences in bite and tongue force, endurance, and maximum mouth opening has become particularly promising since the introduction of causal therapy for SMA. This study aimed to compare oral function among adult persons with SMA with different SMA types, walking abilities, and treatment status to a healthy control group.","Teresa Kruse, Diana Leflerovà, Annette Cap, Sara Portegys, Brunhilde Wirth, Raoul Heller, Svenja Brakemeier, Tim Hagenacker, Bert Braumann, Gilbert Wunderlich",2024

Cognitive impairment in children with 5q-associated spinal muscular atrophy type 1: two case reports and the review of the literature.,"Spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) is an autosomal recessive disease caused by mutations in the survival motor neuron 1 (SMN1) gene on chromosome 5, leading to the degeneration of lower motor neurons. There are few studies on cognitive impairment comorbid with SMA. Here, we report two cases of severe cognitive impairment in Chinese children with SMA type 1, marking the first such reports in this demographic. We propose that severe cognitive dysfunction may be a comorbidity of SMA. Clinicians should consider SMA in patients presenting with severe muscle weakness and atrophy accompanied by cognitive impairments, to avoid misdiagnosis and oversight.","Hua Yang, Jie Yang, Yawen Xue, Lihui Liao, Qianyun Cai, Rong Luo",2024
Why should a 5q spinal muscular atrophy neonatal screening program be started?,"Spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) is a genetic neuromuscular progressive disorder that is currently treatable. The sooner the disease-modifying therapies are started, the better the prognosis. Newborn screening for SMA, which is already performed in many countries, has been scheduled to begin in the near future. The development of a well-organized program is paramount to achieve favorable outcomes for the child who is born with the disease and for the costs involved in health care. We herein present a review paper hoping to point out that SMA neonatal screening is urgent and will not increase the cost of its care.","Michele Michelin Becker, Flávia Nardes, Tamara Dangouloff, Laurent Servais, Alexandra Prufer de Queiroz Campos Araujo, Juliana Gurgel-Giannetti",2024

Spinal muscular atrophy carrier screening program: awareness and attitude of healthcare professionals in Turkey.,"Spinal Muscular Atrophy (SMA) is an autosomal recessive disease caused by variants in the SMN1 gene, leading to progressive muscle weakness. The carrier frequency of SMN1 gene variants, including variant and copy number variations, is estimated to be around 1 in 50 people, while the global prevalence of SMA is 1-3 per 10,000 live births. In response to the increasing carrier proportion, especially due to consanguineous marriages, Turkey launched the SMA Carrier Screening Program in 2021. Notably, recent SMA cases have been observed in the children of healthcare workers who did not undergo carrier screening, prompting us to evaluate their awareness of this program. After receiving ethics approval, 1,322 healthcare professionals completed a 15-item survey based on the SMA Carrier Screening Guidelines. Of these, 5.8% were unaware of SMA, and 26% lacked information about the national screening program. Awareness of the screening program was significantly lower among secondary and tertiary healthcare professionals compared to primary healthcare professionals (p < 0.0001) and among non-physician healthcare professionals compared to physicians (p < 0.0001). Additionally, a serious lack of knowledge was observed concerning the parts of the screening covering the pregnancy period. Although there is generally high awareness of the SMA Carrier Screening Program among healthcare professionals, significant knowledge gaps exist. These findings highlight the need for increased efforts to more effectively deliver screening programs and continue the education of healthcare professionals. Education and awareness campaigns can enhance program awareness and effectiveness, reach wider audiences, and contribute to preventive measures for the health of future generations.","Kubra Muge Celik, Canan Ceylan Kose, Derya Kaya, Koray Tekin, Fatma Silan",2024
Long-term natural history in type II and III spinal muscular atrophy: a 4-year international study on the Hammersmith Functional Motor Scale Expanded.,"Spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) is a genetic disorder caused by SMN1 gene mutations. Although studies on available disease-modifying treatments have reported their efficacy and safety, long-term natural history data are lacking for comparison. The aim of this prospective study was to report 4-year changes on the Hammersmith Functional Motor Scale Expanded (HFMSE) in type II and III SMA in relation to several variables such as age, functional status and SMN2 copy number.","Giorgia Coratti, Francesca Bovis, Maria Carmela Pera, Matthew Civitello, Annemarie Rohwer, Francesca Salmin, Allan M Glanzman, Jacqueline Montes, Amy Pasternak, Roberto De Sanctis, Sally Dunaway Young, Tina Duong, Irene Mizzoni, Evelin Milev, Maria Sframeli, Simone Morando, Emilio Albamonte, Adele D'Amico, Michela Catteruccia, Noemi Brolatti, Marika Pane, Mariacristina Scoto, Sonia Messina, Jesica Exposito Escudero, Liesbeth De Waele, Michio Hirano, Zarazuela Zolkipli-Cunningham, Basil T Darras, Enrico Bertini, Andres Nascimiento Osorio, Claudio Bruno, Natalie Goemans, Valeria A Sansone, John Day, Giovanni Baranello, Francesco Muntoni, Richard Finkel, Eugenio Mercuri",2024
Profiling neuroinflammatory markers and response to nusinersen in paediatric spinal muscular atrophy.,"Neuroinflammation is an emerging clinical feature in spinal muscular atrophy (SMA). Characterizing neuroinflammatory cytokines in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) in SMA and their response to nusinersen is important for identifying new biomarkers and understanding the pathophysiology of SMA. We measured twenty-seven neuroinflammatory markers in CSF from twenty SMA children at different time points, and correlated the findings with motor function improvement. At baseline, MCP-1, IL-7 and IL-8 were significantly increased in SMA1 patients compared to SMA2, and were significantly correlated with disease severity. After six months of nusinersen treatment, CSF levels of eotaxin and MIP-1β were markedly reduced, while IL-2, IL-4 and VEGF-A were increased. The decreases in eotaxin and MIP-1β were associated with changes in motor scores in SMA1. We also detected a transient increase in MCP-1, MDC, MIP-1α, IL-12/IL-23p40 and IL-8 after the first or second injection of nusinersen, followed by a steady return to baseline levels within six months. Our study provides a detailed profile of neuroinflammatory markers in SMA CSF. Our data confirms the potential of MCP-1, eotaxin and MIP-1β as new neuroinflammatory biomarkers in SMA1 and indicates the presence of a subtle inflammatory response to nusinersen during the early phase of treatment.","Qiang Zhang, Ying Hong, Chiara Brusa, Mariacristina Scoto, Nikki Cornell, Parth Patel, Giovanni Baranello, Francesco Muntoni, Haiyan Zhou",2024
A systematic review of economic evaluations of orphan medicines for the management of spinal muscular atrophy.,"Spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) is a rare inherited autosomal recessive progressive disease of a varying phenotype, with varying clinical symptoms, and as a result the patients suffering from it require multiple types of care. It was deemed useful to conduct a systematic literature review on the pharmacoeconomic evaluations of all currently registered disease-modifying therapies in order to inform policy and highlight research gaps. Pharmacoeconomic analyses written in English and published after 2016 were considered for inclusion. PubMed/Medline, Global Health and Embase were systematically and separately searched between 16 October and 23 October 2023. Hand-searching was also conducted on PubMed based on reference lists of published literature. After the exclusion criteria were applied, 14 studies were included. BMJ checklist was used for quality assessment and the Consolidated Health Economic Evaluation Reporting Standards (CHEERS) checklist was used to assess the quality of reporting of all included studies. Data extraction was performed manually. Regarding evidence synthesis, data were heterogeneous and are thus presented based on comparison. This study confirms the need for pharmacoeconomic analyses (cost-effectiveness or cost-utility) also in cases when the cost of treatment is very high and the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio values exceed the usual, acceptable values for standard therapy. Specific willingness to pay thresholds for orphan medicines are of the utmost importance, to allow patients with SMA to have access to safe and effective treatments. With such economic evaluations, it is possible to compare the value of medications with the same indication, but it should be emphasized that in the interpretation of data and in making decisions about the use of medicines, the impact of new knowledge should be considered.","Andrej Belančić, Andrea Katrin Faour, Elvira Meni Maria Gkrinia, Dinko Vitezić",2024
Spinal presentations in children with spinal muscular atrophy type 1 following gene therapy treatment with onasemnogene abeparvovec - The SMA REACH UK network experience.,"Spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) is a neuromuscular disorder of mainly early onset and variable severity. Prior to the introduction of disease modifying therapies (DMTs), children with SMA type 1 typically died before 2 years of age and management was primarily palliative. Onasemnogene abeparvovec (OA), nusinersen, and risdiplam are novel DMTs which ameliorate the effects of the underlying genetic defect at least partially making SMA a treatable condition. Survival and achievement of previously unmet developmental milestones result in treated SMA type 1 children spending more time upright than expected based on the natural history of the treatment-naïve condition. Consequently, spinal asymmetry and kyphosis, features not typically seen in untreated SMA type 1 children due to early mortality, are increasingly common complications. Precise data regarding their prevalence, severity, and management are currently limited. This study describes the spinal features and management in 75 children with SMA type 1 who received OA between March 2021 and December 2022. Retrospective analysis from SMA REACH UK data showed that 44/75 (59 %) clinically had spinal asymmetry and 37 (49 %) had kyphosis. This study aims to raise awareness of this important feature as part of the changed natural history of SMA type 1 post OA treatment.","Amy Wolfe, Jennie Sheehan, Alex Schofield, Helen Cranney, Emer O'Reilly, Georgia Stimpson, Alice Andrews, Maria Vanegas, Jonathan Lucas, Mariacristina Scoto, Vasantha Gowda, Elizabeth Wraige, Heinz Jungbluth",2024
Antisense oligonucleotides and their applications in rare neurological diseases.,"Rare diseases affect almost 500 million people globally, predominantly impacting children and often leading to significantly impaired quality of life and high treatment costs. While significant contributions have been made to develop effective treatments for those with rare diseases, more rapid drug discovery strategies are needed. Therapeutic antisense oligonucleotides can modulate target gene expression with high specificity through various mechanisms determined by base sequences and chemical modifications; and have shown efficacy in clinical trials for a few rare neurological conditions. Therefore, this review will focus on the applications of antisense oligonucleotides, in particular splice-switching antisense oligomers as promising therapeutics for rare neurological diseases, with key examples of Duchenne muscular dystrophy and spinal muscular atrophy. Challenges and future perspectives in developing antisense therapeutics for rare conditions including target discovery, antisense chemical modifications, animal models for therapeutic validations, and clinical trial designs will also be briefly discussed.","Simon McDowall, May Aung-Htut, Steve Wilton, Dunhui Li",2024

Recent Advance in Disease Modifying Therapies for Spinal Muscular Atrophy.,"Spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) is an autosomal recessive motor neuron disease characterized by progressive weakness and atrophy of skeletal muscles. With homozygous survival motor neuron 1 (SMN1) gene mutation, all SMA patients have at least one copy of the SMN2 gene, which provides an opportunity for drug targeting to enhance SMN expression. Current three disease modifying drugs, including nusinersen, onasemnogene abeparvovec, and risdiplam, have demonstrated impressive effectiveness in SMA treatment. Nusinersen is an antisense oligonucleotide targeting SMN2 pre-messenger RNA (mRNA) to modify alternative splicing and is effective in SMA children and adults, administrating via intermittent intrathecal injection. Onasemnogene abeparvovec is an adeno-associated viral vector carrying human SMN1 gene, featuring intravenous injection once in a lifetime for SMA patients less than 2 years of the age. Risdiplam is a small molecule also targeting SMN2 pre-mRNA and is effective in SMA children and adults with administration via oral intake once per day. Patients with SMA should receive these disease modifying therapies as soon as possible to not only stabilize disease progression, but potentially obtain neurological improvement. The development in these therapies has benefited patients with SMA and will potentially provide insight in future drug discovery for other neurodegenerative diseases.

Development of an ultrasound-based metric of muscle functional capacity for use in patients with neuromuscular disease.,"Spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) and Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) are progressive neuromuscular disorders characterized by severe muscle weakness and functional decline (Pillen et al., Muscle Nerve 2008; 37(6):679-693). With new therapeutics, objective methods with increased sensitivity are needed to assess muscle function. Ultrasound imaging is a promising approach for assessing muscle fat and fibrosis in neuromuscular disorders. This study builds on prior work by combining ultrasound-based measurements of muscle size, shape, and quality, relating these measures to muscle strength, and proposing a multivariable image-based estimate of muscle function.","Allison N McCrady, Chelsea D Masterson, Laura E Barnes, Rebecca J Scharf, Silvia S Blemker",2024

Evaluating the clinical efficacy of a long-read sequencing-based approach for carrier screening of spinal muscular atrophy.,"Spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) is the second most common fatal genetic disease in infancy. It is caused by deletion or intragenic pathogenic variants of the causative gene SMN1, which degenerates anterior horn motor neurons and leads to progressive myasthenia and muscle atrophy. Early treatment improves motor function and prognosis in patients with SMA, but drugs are expensive and do not cure the disease. Therefore, carrier screening seems to be the most effective way to prevent SMA birth defects. In this study, we genetically analyzed 1400 samples using multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA) and quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR), and compared the consistency of the results. We randomly selected 44 samples with consistent MLPA and qPCR results for comprehensive SMA analysis (CASMA) using a long-read sequencing (LRS)-based approach. CASMA results showed 100% consistency, visually and intuitively explained the inconsistency between exons 7 and 8 copy numbers detected by MLPA in 13 samples. A total of 16 samples showed inconsistent MLPA and qPCR results for SMN1 exon 7. CASMA was performed on all samples and the results were consistent with those of resampling for MLPA and qPCR detection. CASMA also detected an additional intragenic variant c.-39A>G in a sample with two copies of SMN1 (RT02). Finally, we detected 23 SMA carriers, with an estimated carrier rate of 1/61 in this cohort. In addition, CASMA identified the ""2 + 0"" carrier status of SMN1 and SMN2 in a family by analyzing the genotypes of only three samples (parents and one sibling). CASMA has great advantages over MLPA and qPCR assays, and could become a powerful technical support for large-scale screening of SMA.","Ju Long, Di Cui, Chunhui Yu, Wanli Meng",2024
Onasemnogene-abeparvovec administration to premature infants with spinal muscular atrophy.,"Twin girls born at 30 weeks' gestation with spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) received onsasemnogene-abeparvovec (OA) at 3.5 weeks of life. They had no treatment-related adverse events, normal acquisition of motor milestones, and normal neurological examination at 19 months. Genotyping revealed 0 copies of SMN1 and a single, hybrid SMN2 gene containing the positive genetic modifier c.835-44A>G. This was associated with full-length SMN2 blood mRNA expression levels similar to a 2 copy SMA infant. The observed favorable outcomes are likely due to the genetic modifier combined with early drug administration enabled by prematurity.","Stephen M Brown, Aparna S Ajjarapu, Divya Ramachandra, Laura Blasco-Pérez, Mar Costa-Roger, Eduardo F Tizzano, Charlotte J Sumner, Katherine D Mathews",2024
