Novel <i>HexA</i> splice site mutations in a patient with late atypical onset Tay-Sachs disease: importance of combined NGS and biochemical analysis.,"Tay-Sachs disease (TSD) is a rare genetic disorder with diverse clinical manifestations, often leading to underdiagnosis due to symptom similarities with other neurological conditions. In this study, we aimed to identify the genetic mutations underlying late-onset TSD in a 27-year-old patient with progressive neurological symptoms. Whole-exome sequencing revealed two <i>hexA</i> gene mutations associated with TSD: a previously known variant, c.805G > A (p.Gly269Ser), and a novel splice-site mutation, c.346 + 2dupT. Through clinical assessments, genetic analysis, and functional investigations-including RNA sequencing and enzymatic activity assays-we confirmed the pathogenicity of the novel mutation. Our findings highlight the efficacy of advanced genomic technologies in diagnosing intricate genetic disorders and emphasize the significance of functional validation to confirm the effects of mutations. Identifying compound heterozygous mutations in the <i>hexA</i> gene also provides insight into Mendelian inheritance patterns. This case highlights the diagnostic challenges posed by overlapping clinical phenotypes and emphasizes the need for increased genetic awareness among clinicians. Accurate diagnosis of TSD has significant implications for patients and their families, allowing for informed genetic counseling and guiding clinical management decisions. While current treatment options are limited, timely and accurate diagnosis holds promise for future research and therapeutic interventions. This study highlights the value of a multidisciplinary approach in exploring the molecular basis of complex genetic diseases and informing clinical decisions.","Alina Bilyalova, Elena Shagimardanova, Airat Bilyalov, Marina Zaripova, Leyla Shigapova, Guzel Gazizova, Pavel Mazin, Bukina Tatiana, Oleg Gusev",2024
Treating late-onset Tay Sachs disease: Brain delivery with a dual trojan horse protein.,"Tay-Sachs (TS) disease is a neurodegenerative disease resulting from mutations in the gene encoding the α-subunit (HEXA) of lysosomal β-hexosaminidase A (HexA). We report that (1) recombinant HEXA alone increased HexA activity and decreased GM2 content in human TS glial cells and peripheral mononuclear blood cells; 2) a recombinant chimeric protein composed of HEXA linked to two blood-brain barrier (BBB) entry elements, a transferrin receptor binding sequence and granulocyte-colony stimulating factor, associates with HEXB <i>in vitro</i>; reaches human cultured TS cells lysosomes and mouse brain cells, especially neurons, <i>in vivo</i>; lowers GM2 in cultured human TS cells; lowers whole brain GM2 concentration by approximately 40% within 6 weeks, when injected intravenously (IV) to adult TS-mutant mice mimicking the slow course of late-onset TS; and increases forelimbs grip strength. Hence, a chimeric protein equipped with dual BBB entry elements can transport a large protein such as HEXA to the brain, decrease the accumulation of GM2, and improve muscle strength, thereby providing potential treatment for late-onset TS.","Esther Osher, Yossi Anis, Ruth Singer-Shapiro, Nataly Urshanski, Tamar Unger, Shira Albeck, Oren Bogin, Gary Weisinger, Fortune Kohen, Avi Valevski, Aviva Fattal-Valevski, Liora Sagi, Michal Weitman, Yulia Shenberger, Nadav Sagiv, Ruth Navon, Meir Wilchek, Naftali Stern",2024

Immune responses to central nervous system directed adeno-associated virus gene therapy: Does direct CNS delivery make a difference?,"Adeno-associated virus (AAV) mediated gene therapy is a leading gene delivery platform with potential to transform the landscape of treatment for neurological disorders. While AAV is deemed non-immunogenic compared to other viral vectors, adverse immune reactions have been observed in the clinic, raising concerns. As the central nervous system (CNS) has a tightly regulated immune system, characterized by a degree of tolerance, it has been considered a unique target for AAV gene therapy. AAV vectors have shown promising results for the treatment of several CNS disorders including Spinal Muscular Atrophy, Giant Axonal Neuropathy, Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis, Tay Sachs Disease, Parkinson's Disease, and others, demonstrating safety and success. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval of Zolgensma and European Medicines Agency (EMA) approval of Upstaza, for Spinal Muscular Atrophy (SMA) and Aromatic l-amino acid decarboxylase deficiency (AADC) respectively, represent this success, all while highlighting significant differences in immune responses to AAV, particularly with regards to therapeutic administration route. AAV therapies like Upstaza that are injected directly into the immune-specialized brain have been characterized by mild immune response profiles and minor adverse events, whereas therapies like Zolgensma that are injected systemically demonstrate more robust immune stimulation and off-target toxicities. Despite these contrasting parallels, these therapeutics and others in the clinic have demonstrated clinical benefit for patients, warranting further exploration of immune responses to CNS-directed AAV clinical trials. Thus, in this review, we discuss effects of different routes of AAV administration on eliciting local and peripheral immune responses specifically observed in CNS-targeted trials.","Ashley L Harkins, Prajakta P Ambegaokar, Allison M Keeler",2024
Burden of rare genetic disorders in India: twenty-two years' experience of a tertiary centre.,"Rare disorders comprise of ~ 7500 different conditions affecting multiple systems. Diagnosis of rare diseases is complex due to dearth of specialized medical professionals, testing labs and limited therapeutic options. There is scarcity of data on the prevalence of rare diseases in different populations. India being home to a large population comprising of 4600 population groups, of which several thousand are endogamous, is likely to have a high burden of rare diseases. The present study provides a retrospective overview of a cohort of patients with rare genetic diseases identified at a tertiary genetic test centre in India.","Jayesh Sheth, Aadhira Nair, Frenny Sheth, Manali Ajagekar, Tejasvi Dhondekar, Inusha Panigrahi, Ashish Bavdekar, Sheela Nampoothiri, Chaitanya Datar, Ajit Gandhi, Mamta Muranjan, Anupriya Kaur, Manisha Desai, Mehul Mistri, Chitra Patel, Premal Naik, Maulin Shah, Koumudi Godbole, Seema Kapoor, Neerja Gupta, Sunita Bijarnia-Mahay, Sandeep Kadam, Dhaval Solanki, Soham Desai, Anand Iyer, Ketan Patel, Harsh Patel, Raju C Shah, Shalmi Mehta, Ruchi Shah, Riddhi Bhavsar, Jhanvi Shah, Mili Pandya, Bhagyadhan Patel, Sudhir Shah, Heli Shah, Shalin Shah, Shruti Bajaj, Siddharth Shah, Nilam Thaker, Umesh Kalane, Mahesh Kamate, Vykunta Raju Kn, Naresh Tayade, Sujatha Jagadeesan, Deepika Jain, Mitesh Chandarana, Jitendra Singh, Sanjiv Mehta, Beena Suresh, Harsh Sheth",2024
Tandem mass spectrometric enzyme assay for simultaneous detection of Tay-Sachs and Sandhoff diseases in dried blood spots for newborn screening.,"GM2 gangliosidosis is a group of rare lysosomal storage disorders (LSDs) including Tay-Sachs disease (TSD) and Sandhoff disease (SD), caused by deficiency in activity of either β-hexosaminidase A (HexA) or both β-hexosaminidase A and β-hexosaminidase B (HexB). Methods for screening and diagnosis of TSD and SD include measurement and comparison of the activity of these two enzymes. Here we report a novel method for duplex screening of dried blood spots (DBS) for TSD and SD by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). The method requires incubation of a single 3 mm DBS punch with the assay cocktail followed by the injection into the LC-MS/MS. The performance of the method was evaluated by comparing the confirmed TSD and SD patient DBS to random healthy newborn DBS which showed easy discrimination between the three cohorts. The method is multiplexable with other LSD MS/MS enzyme assays which is critical to the continued expansion of the NBS panels.","Zackary M Herbst, Stephan Hold, Michael H Gelb, Hamid Khaledi",2024
Clinical outcome assessments of disease burden and progression in late-onset GM2 gangliosidoses.,"The late-onset GM2 gangliosidoses, comprising late-onset Tay-Sachs and Sandhoff diseases, are rare, slowly progressive, neurogenetic disorders primarily characterized by neurogenic weakness, ataxia, and dysarthria. The aim of this longitudinal study was to characterize the natural history of late-onset GM2 gangliosidoses using a number of clinical outcome assessments to measure different aspects of disease burden and progression over time, including neurological, functional, and quality of life, to inform the design of future clinical interventional trials. Patients attending the United States National Tay-Sachs & Allied Diseases Family Conference between 2015 and 2019 underwent annual clinical outcome assessments. Currently, there are no clinical outcome assessments validated to assess late-onset GM2 gangliosidoses; therefore, instruments used or designed for diseases with similar features, or to address various aspects of the clinical presentations, were used. Clinical outcome assessments included the Friedreich's Ataxia Rating Scale, the 9-Hole Peg Test, and the Assessment of Intelligibility of Dysarthric Speech. Twenty-three patients participated in at least one meeting visit (late-onset Tay-Sachs, n = 19; late-onset Sandhoff, n = 4). Patients had high disease burden at baseline, and scores for the different clinical outcome assessments were generally lower than would be expected for the general population. Longitudinal analyses showed slow, but statistically significant, neurological progression as evidenced by worsening scores on the 9-Hole Peg Test (2.68%/year, 95% CI: 0.13-5.29; p = 0.04) and the Friedreich's Ataxia Rating Scale neurological examination (1.31 points/year, 95% CI: 0.26-2.35; p = 0.02). Time since diagnosis to study entry correlated with worsening scores on the 9-Hole Peg Test (r = 0.728; p < 0.001), Friedreich's Ataxia Rating Scale neurological examination (r = 0.727; p < 0.001), and Assessment of Intelligibility of Dysarthric Speech intelligibility (r = -0.654; p = 0.001). In summary, patients with late-onset GM2 gangliosidoses had high disease burden and slow disease progression. Several clinical outcome assessments suitable for clinical trials showed only small changes and standardized effect sizes (change/standard deviation of change) over 4 years. These longitudinal natural history study results illustrate the challenge of identifying responsive endpoints for clinical trials in rare, slowly progressive, neurogenerative disorders where arguably the treatment goal is to halt or decrease the rate of decline rather than improve clinical status. Furthermore, powering such a study would require a large sample size and/or a long study duration, neither of which is an attractive option for an ultra-rare disease with no available treatment. These findings support the development of potentially more sensitive late-onset GM2 gangliosidoses-specific rating instruments and/or surrogate endpoints for use in future clinical trials.","Julie Kissell, Camille Rochmann, Pascal Minini, Florian Eichler, Christopher D Stephen, Heather Lau, Camilo Toro, Jean M Johnston, Robert Krupnick, Alaa Hamed, Gerald F Cox",2024
"Cinnamic acid, a natural plant compound, exhibits neuroprotection in a mouse model of Sandhoff disease via PPARα.","Tay-Sachs disease (TSD) and its severe form Sandhoff disease (SD) are autosomal recessive lysosomal storage metabolic disorders, which often result into excessive GM2 ganglioside accumulation predominantly in lysosomes of nerve cells. Although patients with these diseases appear normal at birth, the progressive accumulation of undegraded GM2 gangliosides in neurons leads to early death accompanied by manifestation of motor difficulties and gradual loss of behavioral skills. Unfortunately, there is still no effective treatment available for TSD/SD. The present study highlights the importance of cinnamic acid (CA), a naturally occurring aromatic fatty acid present in a number of plants, in inhibiting the disease process in a transgenic mouse model of SD. Oral administration of CA significantly attenuated glial activation and inflammation and reduced the accumulation of GM2 gangliosides/glycoconjugates in the cerebral cortex of Sandhoff mice. Besides, oral CA also improved behavioral performance and increased the survival of Sandhoff mice. While assessing the mechanism, we found that oral administration of CA increased the level of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor α (PPARα) in the brain of Sandhoff mice and that oral CA remained unable to reduce glycoconjugates, improve behavior and increase survival in Sandhoff mice lacking PPARα. Our results indicate a beneficial function of CA that utilizes a PPARα-dependent mechanism to halt the progression of SD and thereby increase the longevity of Sandhoff mice.","Sumita Raha, Ramesh K Paidi, Debashis Dutta, Kalipada Pahan",2024
Eukaryotic release factor 1 from Euplotes promotes frameshifting at premature stop codons in human cells.,"Human physiology is highly susceptible to frameshift mutations within coding regions, and many hereditary diseases and cancers are caused by such indels. Presently, therapeutic options to counteract them are limited and, in the case of direct genome editing, risky. Here, we show that release factor 1 (eRF1) from Euplotes, an aquatic protist known for frequent +1 frameshifts in its coding regions, can enhance +1 ribosomal frameshifting at slippery heptameric sequences in human cells without an apparent requirement for an mRNA secondary structure. We further show an increase in frameshifting rate at the premature termination sequence found in the HEXA gene of Tay-Sachs disease patients, or a breast cancer cell line that harbors a tumor-driving frameshift mutation in GATA3. Although the overall increase in frameshifting would need further improvement for clinical applications, our results underscore the potential of exogenous factors, such as Eu eRF1, to increase frameshifting in human cells.","Bozhidar-Adrian Stefanov, Elvis Ajuh, Sarah Allen, Mariusz Nowacki",2024

CRISPR-Based Gene Editing Techniques in Pediatric Neurological Disorders.,"The emergence of gene editing technologies offers a unique opportunity to develop mutation-specific treatments for pediatric neurological disorders. Gene editing systems can potentially alter disease trajectory by correcting dysfunctional mutations or therapeutically altering gene expression. Clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)-based approaches are attractive gene therapy platforms to personalize treatments because of their specificity, ease of design, versatility, and cost. However, many such approaches remain in the early stages of development, with ongoing efforts to optimize editing efficiency, minimize unintended off-target effects, and mitigate pathologic immune responses. Given the rapid evolution of CRISPR-based therapies, it is prudent for the clinically based child neurologist to have a conceptual understanding of what such therapies may entail, including both benefits and risks and how such therapies may be clinically applied. In this review, we describe the fundamentals of CRISPR-based therapies, discuss the opportunities and challenges that have arisen, and highlight preclinical work in several pediatric neurological diseases.","Stephen Chrzanowski, Ranjan Batra",2024
Infantile Monosialoganglioside2 (GM2) Gangliosidosis With Concurrent Bronchopneumonia: An Extraordinary Case of Tay-Sachs Disease.,"Tay-Sachs disease (TSD) is a rare, fatal neurodegenerative disorder characterized by the deficiency of the enzyme hexosaminidase-A (Hex A), which results in the accumulation of monosialoganglioside2 (GM2) ganglioside within nerve cells, predominantly affecting individuals of Ashkenazi Jewish descent. We report a remarkable case of a three-year-old South Asian male with infantile GM2 gangliosidosis, compounded by bronchopneumonia, a rarely documented complication in Tay-Sachs patients. The patient presented with recurrent seizures, fever, cough, and developmental delay. Confirmation of the diagnosis was obtained through reduced Hex A enzyme activity, corroborated by imaging and blood and urine analyses. Family history was significant for consanguinity and similar sibling fatalities. Despite the progressive nature of the disease, symptomatic management, including antiepileptic drugs, antibiotic therapy, and supportive care, led to an improvement in clinical condition, though ongoing monitoring remains essential. In this case, the coexistence of bronchopneumonia with Tay-Sachs disease is unusual, reflecting the necessity for this case report. The patient's response highlights the potential for symptomatic management, the importance of genetic counseling, and the imperative for research into gene and enzyme replacement therapies. The uniqueness of this case provides novel insights into the disease's spectrum, enhancing awareness, encouraging early diagnosis, and refining care strategies for Tay-Sachs disease, aligning with the broader goals of improving patient outcomes and advancing medical research.","Han Grezenko, Shadi S Al-Deir, Filagot D Eshete, Nuzhat Faran, Ciara S Mimms, Muhammad Ibrahim",2024
Lithium treatment rescues dysfunctional autophagy in the cell models of Tay-Sachs disease.,"Tay-Sachs disease is a rare lysosomal storage disorder (LSD) caused by a mutation in the HexA gene coding β-hexosaminidase A enzyme. The disruption of the HexA gene causes the accumulation of GM2 ganglioside resulting in progressive neurodegeneration in humans. Surprisingly, Hexa-/- mice did not show neurological phenotypes. Our group recently generated a murine model of Tay-Sachs disease exhibiting excessive GM2 accumulation and severe neuropathological abnormalities mimicking Tay-Sachs patients. Previously, we reported impaired autophagic flux in the brain of Hexa/-Neu3-/- mice. However, regulation of autophagic flux using inducers has not been clarified in Tay-Sachs disease cells. Here, we evaluated the effects of lithium treatment on dysfunctional autophagic flux using LC3 and p62 in the fibroblast and neuroglia of Hexa-/-Neu3-/- mice and Tay-Sachs patients. We discovered the clearance of accumulating autophagosomes, aggregate-prone metabolites, and GM2 ganglioside under lithium-induced conditions. Our data suggest that targeting autophagic flux with an autophagy inducer might be a rational therapeutic strategy for the treatment of Tay-Sachs disease.","Hande Basirli, Melike Can, Tugce Sengul, Volkan Seyrantepe",2024
Intrathecal delivery of a bicistronic AAV9 vector expressing β-hexosaminidase A corrects Sandhoff disease in a murine model: A dosage study.,"The pathological accumulation of GM2 ganglioside associated with Tay-Sachs disease (TSD) and Sandhoff disease (SD) occurs in individuals who possess mutant forms of the heterodimer β-hexosaminidase A (Hex A) because of mutation of the <i>HEXA</i> and <i>HEXB</i> genes, respectively. With a lack of approved therapies, patients experience rapid neurological decline resulting in early death. A novel bicistronic vector carrying both <i>HEXA</i> and <i>HEXB</i> previously demonstrated promising results in mouse models of SD following neonatal intravenous administration, including significant reduction in GM2 accumulation, increased levels of Hex A, and a 2-fold extension of survival. The aim of the present study was to identify an optimal dose of the bicistronic vector in 6-week-old SD mice by an intrathecal route of administration along with transient immunosuppression, to inform possible clinical translation. Three doses of the bicistronic vector were tested: 2.5e11, 1.25e11, and 0.625e11 vector genomes per mouse. The highest dose provided the greatest increase in biochemical and behavioral parameters, such that treated mice lived to a median age of 56 weeks (>3 times the lifespan of the SD controls). These results have direct implications in deciding a human equivalent dose for TSD/SD and have informed the approval of a clinical trial application (NCT04798235).","Alex E Ryckman, Natalie M Deschenes, Brianna M Quinville, Karlaina J L Osmon, Melissa Mitchell, Zhilin Chen, Steven J Gray, Jagdeep S Walia",2024
Lipids as Emerging Biomarkers in Neurodegenerative Diseases.,"Biomarkers are molecules that can be used to observe changes in an individual's biochemical or medical status and provide information to aid diagnosis or treatment decisions. Dysregulation in lipid metabolism in the brain is a major risk factor for many neurodegenerative disorders, including frontotemporal dementia, Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Thus, there is a growing interest in using lipids as biomarkers in neurodegenerative diseases, with the anionic phospholipid bis(monoacylglycerol)phosphate and (glyco-)sphingolipids being the most promising lipid classes thus far. In this review, we provide a general overview of lipid biology, provide examples of abnormal lysosomal lipid metabolism in neurodegenerative diseases, and discuss how these insights might offer novel and promising opportunities in biomarker development and therapeutic discovery. Finally, we discuss the challenges and opportunities of lipid biomarkers and biomarker panels in diagnosis, prognosis, and/or treatment response in the clinic.","Justin Wei, Li Chin Wong, Sebastian Boland",2023
Lipid-Lowering Drug Gemfibrozil Protects Mice from Tay-Sachs Disease via Peroxisome Proliferator-Activated Receptor α.,"Tay-Sachs disease (TSD) is a progressive heritable neurodegenerative disorder characterized by the deficiency of the lysosomal β-hexosaminidase enzyme (Hex<sup>-/-</sup>) and the storage of GM2 ganglioside, as well as other related glycoconjugates. Along with motor difficulties, TSD patients also manifest a gradual loss of skills and behavioral problems, followed by early death. Unfortunately, there is no cure for TSD; however, research on treatments and therapeutic approaches is ongoing. This study underlines the importance of gemfibrozil (GFB), an FDA-approved lipid-lowering drug, in inhibiting the disease process in a transgenic mouse model of Tay-Sachs. Oral administration of GFB significantly suppressed glial activation and inflammation, while also reducing the accumulation of GM2 gangliosides/glycoconjugates in the motor cortex of Tay-Sachs mice. Furthermore, oral GFB improved behavioral performance and increased the life expectancy of Tay-Sachs mice. While investigating the mechanism, we found that oral administration of GFB increased the level of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor α (PPARα) in the brain of Tay-Sachs mice, and that GFB remained unable to reduce glycoconjugates and improve behavior and survival in Tay-Sachs mice lacking PPARα. Our results indicate a beneficial function of GFB that employs a PPARα-dependent mechanism to halt the progression of TSD and increase longevity in Tay-Sachs mice.","Sumita Raha, Debashis Dutta, Ramesh K Paidi, Kalipada Pahan",2023
"Quantitative brain morphometry identifies cerebellar, cortical, and subcortical gray and white matter atrophy in late-onset Tay-Sachs disease.","Cerebellar atrophy is a characteristic sign of late-onset Tay-Sachs disease (LOTS). Other structural neuroimaging abnormalities are inconsistently reported. Our study aimed to perform a detailed whole-brain analysis and quantitatively characterize morphometric changes in LOTS patients. Fourteen patients (8 M/6F) with LOTS from three centers were included in this retrospective study. For morphometric brain analyses, we used deformation-based morphometry, voxel-based morphometry, surface-based morphometry, and spatially unbiased cerebellar atlas template. The quantitative whole-brain morphometric analysis confirmed the finding of profound pontocerebellar atrophy with most affected cerebellar lobules V and VI in LOTS patients. Additionally, the atrophy of structures mainly involved in motor control, including bilateral ventral and lateral thalamic nuclei, primary motor and sensory cortex, supplementary motor area, and white matter regions containing corticospinal tract, was present. The atrophy of the right amygdala, hippocampus, and regions of occipital, parietal and temporal white matter was also observed in LOTS patients in contrast with controls (p < 0.05, FWE corrected). Patients with dysarthria and those initially presenting with ataxia had more severe cerebellar atrophy. Our results show predominant impairment of cerebellar regions responsible for speech and hand motor function in LOTS patients. Widespread morphological changes of motor cortical and subcortical regions and tracts in white matter indicate abnormalities in central motor circuits likely coresponsible for impaired speech and motor function.","Jitka Májovská, Igor Nestrašil, Alia Ahmed, Monica T Bondy, Jiří Klempíř, Helena Jahnová, Susanne A Schneider, Dana Horáková, Jan Krásenský, Pavel Ješina, Manuela Vaneckova, David R Nascene, Chester B Whitley, Jeanine R Jarnes, Martin Magner, Petr Dušek",2024
The diagnostic journey for patients with late-onset GM2 Gangliosidoses.,"Late-onset forms of GM2 gangliosidosis-mainly, Tay-Sachs disease and Sandhoff disease-are under-recognized in clinical practice. In these rare lysosomal storage disorders, deficiency of β-hexosaminidase A results in excessive accumulation of GM2 ganglioside primarily within neurons, leading to cell death and progressive neurodegenerative symptoms, including ataxia, dysarthria, muscle weakness, tremors, atrophy, and psychosis. Presentation is variable and often mimics more common neurodegenerative disorders. We conducted semi-structured interviews on GM2 gangliosidoses diagnosis and treatment with five experts, 30 neurologists, and 28 patients and caregivers. Symptom onset occurred during adolescence/early adulthood in 92% of patients (median age: 14 years). Patients first visited a healthcare provider at a median age of 20 years and received a GM2 diagnosis at a median age of 26 years. Nearly all patients reported problems with their legs and balance starting from symptom onset. Problems with memory, attention span, speech and fatigue were reported more after diagnosis. Patients visited an average of eight healthcare providers before receiving a diagnosis; 64% were diagnosed by a neurologist. Four neurologists (13%) in our sample were aware that there are late-onset forms of GM2 gangliosidosis. The path to diagnosis is long for this late-onset form of a classically fatal infantile disease.","Mariah C Lopshire, Cynthia Tifft, John Burns, Rebecca Gould, Riliang Zheng, Isabela Batsu",2023
Efficacy of Adeno-Associated Virus Serotype 9-Mediated Gene Therapy for AB-Variant GM2 Gangliosidosis.,"GM2 gangliosidoses are a group of neurodegenerative lysosomal storage disorders that are characterized by the accumulation of GM2 gangliosides (GM2), leading to rapid neurological decline and death. The hydrolysis of GM2 requires the specific synthesis, processing, and combination of products of three genes-<i>HEXA</i>, <i>HEXB</i>, and <i>GM2A</i>-within the cell's lysosomes. Mutations in these genes result in Tay-Sachs disease, Sandhoff disease, or AB-variant GM2 gangliosidosis (ABGM2), respectively. ABGM2, the rarest of the three types, is characterized by a mutation in the <i>GM2A</i> gene, which encodes the GM2 activator (GM2A) protein. Being a monogenic disease, gene therapy is a plausible and likely effective method of treatment for ABGM2. This study aimed at assessing the effects of administering a one-time intravenous treatment of single-stranded Adeno-associated virus serotype 9 (ssAAV9)-<i>GM2A</i> viral vector at a dose of 1 × 10<sup>14</sup> vector genomes (vg) per kilogram per mouse in an ABGM2 mouse model (<i>Gm2a</i><sup>-/-</sup>). <i>ssAAV9-GM2A</i> was administered at 1-day (neonatal) or 6-weeks of age (adult-stage). The results demonstrated that, in comparison to <i>Gm2a</i><sup>-/-</sup> mice that received a vehicle injection, the treated mice had reduced GM2 accumulation within the central nervous system and had long-term persistence of vector genomes in the brain and liver. This proof-of-concept study is a step forward towards the development of a clinically therapeutic approach for the treatment of patients with ABGM2.","Meera Vyas, Natalie M Deschenes, Karlaina J L Osmon, Zhilin Chen, Imtiaz Ahmad, Shalini Kot, Patrick Thompson, Chris Richmond, Steven J Gray, Jagdeep S Walia",2023
Late-onset Tay-Sachs disease presenting with a neuromuscular phenotype-a case series.,"Tay-Sachs disease is a rare and often fatal, autosomal recessive, lysosomal storage disease.

Nursing Care Plan for Patients with Tay-Sachs-A Rare Paediatric Disease.,"Tay-Sachs disease is classified as a rare paediatric disease of metabolic origin. It is an autosomal recessive inherited disease. The gene responsible for the disease is known as HEXA, and it is located on chromosome 15(15q23). There is currently no effective treatment for Tay-Sachs disease; hence, it is an incurable disease in which patients do not live for more than five years, meaning that nursing care takes on greater importance to maintain quality of life. The main objective of this work is to develop a specific standard nursing care plan by applying an inductive research method supported by nursing methodology using the NANDA-NIC-NOC taxonomy and validated by the Delphi method. This care plan will improve the knowledge of health professionals on this topic and support future studies on the disease. Following its implementation, the care plan proposed in this study aims to increase the quality of life of patients diagnosed with this disease.","Jonathan Cortés-Martín, Beatriz Piqueras-Sola, Juan Carlos Sánchez-García, Andrés Reinoso-Cobo, Laura Ramos-Petersen, Lourdes Díaz-Rodríguez, Raquel Rodríguez-Blanque",2023
From amaurotic idiocy to biochemically defined lipid storage diseases: the first identification of GM1-Gangliosidosis.,"On February 23<sup>rd</sup> 1936, a boy-child (""Kn"") died in an asylum near Munich after years of severe congenital disease, which had profoundly impaired his development leading to inability to walk, talk and see as well as to severe epilepsy. While a diagnosis of ""Little's disease"" was made during life, his postmortem brain investigation at Munich neuropathology (""Deutsche Forschungsanstalt für Psychiatrie"") revealed the diagnosis of ""amaurotic idiocy"" (AI). AI, as exemplified by Tay-Sachs-Disease (TSD), back then was not yet understood as a specific inborn error of metabolism encompassing several disease entities. Many neuropathological studies were performed on AI, but the underlying processes could only be revealed by new scientific techniques such as biochemical analysis of nervous tissue, deciphering AI as nervous system lipid storage diseases, e.g. GM2-gangliosidosis. In 1963, Sandhoff & Jatzkewitz published an article on a ""biochemically special form of AI"" reporting striking differences when comparing their biochemical observations of hallmark features of TSD to tissue composition in a single case: the boy Kn. This was the first description of ""GM1-Gangliosidosis"", later understood as resulting from genetically determined deficiency in beta-galactosidase. Here we present illustrative materials from this historic patient, including selected diagnostic slides from the case ""Kn"" in virtual microscopy, original records and other illustrative material available. Finally, we present results from genetic analysis performed on archived tissue proving beta-galactosidase-gene mutation, verifying the 1963 interpretation as correct. This synopsis shall give a first-hand impression of this milestone finding in neuropathology. <b>Original paper:</b> On a biochemically special form of infantile amaurotic idiocy.

"Genesis of a Fact: Tay-Sachs Disease as a ""Simple Recessive"".","""Obvious"" recessive inheritance of Tay-Sachs disease (TSD; OMIM # 272800) took over half a century to be established. Points now taken for granted were problematic, that: (1) TSD is a biological entity, not an artificial selection of concurrent findings, (2) manifestations have narrow limits, (3) it was not part of a spectrum of disorders, and can be differentiated from other conditions, (4) it will not change to another disease, (5) it is due to a single specific gene, (6) there are no secondary causes, (7) the gene has no apparent clinical effects unrelated to TSD, and (8) the gene is inherited only as a clinical recessive. To a large extent, resolution reflected biochemical understanding that took until mid-20th century, and beyond, to change how physicians viewed diseases in general. With this, biochemical carrier screening and prenatal biochemical diagnosis have become routinely available, and it is a model for carrier population screening, while gene therapy for the disease has been reported with some degree of success. Here, the history of medical ideas about TSD and its inheritance are reviewed to show how it achieved its current status as a distinct recessive disorder.",Mark Lubinsky,2023
Increasing β-hexosaminidase A activity using genetically modified mesenchymal stem cells.,"GM2 gangliosidoses are a group of autosomal-recessive lysosomal storage disorders. These diseases result from a deficiency of lysosomal enzyme β-hexosaminidase A (HexA), which is responsible for GM2 ganglioside degradation. HexA deficiency causes the accumulation of GM2-gangliosides mainly in the nervous system cells, leading to severe progressive neurodegeneration and neuroinflammation. To date, there is no treatment for these diseases. Cell-mediated gene therapy is considered a promising treatment for GM2 gangliosidoses. This study aimed to evaluate the ability of genetically modified mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs-HEXA-HEXB) to restore HexA deficiency in Tay-Sachs disease patient cells, as well as to analyze the functionality and biodistribution of MSCs in vivo. The effectiveness of HexA deficiency cross-correction was shown in mutant MSCs upon interaction with MSCs-HEXA-HEXB. The results also showed that the MSCs-HEXA-HEXB express the functionally active HexA enzyme, detectable in vivo, and intravenous injection of the cells does not cause an immune response in animals. These data suggest that genetically modified mesenchymal stem cells have the potentials to treat GM2 gangliosidoses.","Alisa A Shaimardanova, Daria S Chulpanova, Valeriya V Solovyeva, Shaza S Issa, Aysilu I Mullagulova, Angelina A Titova, Yana O Mukhamedshina, Anna V Timofeeva, Alexander M Aimaletdinov, Islam R Nigmetzyanov, Albert A Rizvanov",2024
Efficacy and safety of miglustat in the treatment of GM2 gangliosidosis: A systematic review.,"Since the results of previous studies regarding the safety and efficacy of miglustat in GM2 gangliosidosis (GM2g) were inconsistent, we aimed to assess miglustat therapy in GM2g patients.","Vahid Mansouri, Ali Reza Tavasoli, Masoud Khodarahmi, Mohammad Sedigh Dakkali, Sara Daneshfar, Mahmoud Reza Ashrafi, Morteza Heidari, Sareh Hosseinpour, Fariborz Sharifianjazi, Maryam Bemanalizadeh",2023
Autophagic flux is impaired in the brain tissue of Tay-Sachs disease mouse model.,"Tay-Sachs disease is a lethal lysosomal storage disorder caused by mutations in the HexA gene encoding the α subunit of the lysosomal β-hexosaminidase enzyme (HEXA). Abnormal GM2 ganglioside accumulation causes progressive deterioration in the central nervous system in Tay-Sachs patients. Hexa-/- mouse model failed to display abnormal phenotype. Recently, our group generated Hexa-/-Neu3-/- mouse showed severe neuropathological indications similar to Tay-Sachs patients. Despite excessive GM2 ganglioside accumulation in the brain and visceral organs, the regulation of autophagy has not been clarified yet in the Tay-Sachs disease mouse model. Therefore, we investigated distinct steps of autophagic flux using markers including LC3 and p62 in four different brain regions from the Hexa-/-Neu3-/- mice model of Tay-Sachs disease. Our data revealed accumulated autophagosomes and autophagolysosomes indicating impairment in autophagic flux in the brain. We suggest that autophagy might be a new therapeutic target for the treatment of devastating Tay-Sachs disease.","Tugce Sengul, Melike Can, Nurselin Ateş, Volkan Seyrantepe",2023
Biochemical and mutational analyses of HEXA in a cohort of Egyptian patients with infantile Tay-Sachs disease. Expansion of the mutation spectrum.,"Tay-Sachs disease (TSD), an autosomal recessively inherited neurodegenerative lysosomal storage disease, reported worldwide with a high incidence among population of Eastern European and Ashkenazi Jewish descent. Mutations in the alpha subunit of HEXA that encodes for the β-hexosaminidase-A lead to deficient enzyme activity and TSD phenotype. This study is the first to highlight the HEXA sequence variations spectrum in a cohort of Egyptian patients with infantile TSD.","Doaa M A Ibrahim, Ola S M Ali, Hala Nasr, Ekram Fateen, Alice AbdelAleem",2023
