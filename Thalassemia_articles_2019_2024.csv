Exploring alterations of gut/blood microbes in addressing iron overload-induced gut dysbiosis and cognitive impairment in thalassemia patients.,"Iron overload causes cognitive impairment in thalassemia patients. The gut-brain axis plays an important role in cognitive function. However, the association between gut/blood microbiome, cognition, and iron burden in thalassemia patients has not been thoroughly investigated. We aimed to determine those associations in thalassemia patients with different blood-transfusion regimens. Sixty participants: healthy controls, transfusion-dependent thalassemia (TDT) patients, and non-transfusion-dependent (NTDT) patients, were recruited to evaluate iron overload, cognition, and gut/blood microbiome. TDT patients exhibited greater iron overload than NTDT patients. Most thalassemia patients developed gut dysbiosis, and approximately 25% of the patients developed minor cognitive impairment. Increased Fusobacteriota and Verrucomicrobiota with decreased Fibrobacterota were observed in both TDT and NTDT groups. TDT patients showed more abundant beneficial bacteria: Verrucomicrobia. Iron overload was correlated with cognitive impairment. Increased Butyricimonas and decreased Paraclostridium were associated with higher cognitive function. No trace of blood microbiota was observed. Differences in blood bacterial profiles of thalassemia patients and controls were insignificant. These findings suggest iron overload plays a role in the imbalance of gut microbiota and impaired cognitive function in thalassemia patients. Harnessing probiotic potential from those microbes could prevent the gut-brain disturbance in thalassemia patients.","Kanokphong Suparan, Kornkanok Trirattanapa, Pokpong Piriyakhuntorn, Sirawit Sriwichaiin, Chanisa Thonusin, Wichwara Nawara, Sasiwan Kerdpoo, Nipon Chattipakorn, Adisak Tantiworawit, Siriporn C Chattipakorn",2024
Impact of Empagliflozin on the Outcomes of β-Thalassemia Major in Patients With Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus: The THALEMPA Observational Study.,"Beta-thalassemia major (β-TM) is a genetic disorder characterized by ineffective erythropoiesis and chronic hemolytic anemia, necessitating lifelong blood transfusions and leading to severe complications. This study, termed THALEMPA by the authors, investigated the effect of empagliflozin (EMPA) on β-TM outcomes in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), focusing on disease severity and associated complications of iron overload and hyperuricemia.","Anas Ibraheem, Waseem F Al Tameemi",2024
Acute disseminated encephalomyelitis (ADEM) in a patient with post streptococcal glomerulonephritis (PSGN): A case report.,Concurrent recurrence of acute disseminated encephalomyelitis (ADEM) and poststreptococcal glomerulonephritis (PSGN) in a thalassemia intermedia patient is rare and underscores the complexity of autoimmune disorders.

Prevalence and Molecular Characterization of β-Thalassemia in Kirkuk Province of Northern Iraq.,"To determine the prevalence and molecular basis of β-thalassemia in the Northeastern Iraqi province of Kirkuk, a total of 3954 individuals attending the provincial premarital screening center were recruited. The prevalence of β-thalassemia minor among the screened individuals was found to be 3.0%, while those of Hemoglobin E, and δβ-thalassemia carrier states were 0.05%, and 0.03% respectively. Molecular characterization of the β-thalassemia mutations was achieved by multiplex PCR and reverse hybridization, followed by next generation sequencing for those left uncharacterized by the former technique. Among 19 β-thalassemia mutations identified, seven were the most frequent, namely: IVS-II-1 (G > A), codon 8/9 (+G), IVS-I-6 (T > C), IVS-I-110 (G > A), IVS-I-I (G > A), IVS-I-5 (G > C) and codon 44 (-C) accounting for 78.5% of the mutations. This study further illustrates the heterogeneity of the spectrum of β-thalassemia in different parts of Iraq, and provides an essential step to facilitate prenatal diagnosis in the setting of a future national thalassemia prevention program.","Raghad A Abbas, Riyad H Hassan, Israa M Taghlubee, Safaa I Mohammed, Huda H Mohammed, Hanan H Hasan, Ashwaq T Judi, Luqman S Ali, Wisam J Mohammed, Hiba M Shihab, Thamir A Hussein, Nawras A Al-Kareem, Meaad K Hassan, Nasir Al-Allawi",2024
"The roles of blood picture, haemoglobinopathy traits, and blood groups determined in routine antenatal tests in the screening for complications in pregnancy.","Routine antenatal tests include haemoglobin measurement, usually with red blood cell indices, white cell and platelet counts, and ABO and Rhesus blood groups, are aimed to screen for iron deficiency anaemia, carriage of haemoglobinopathy traits, and other forms of anaemia or other underlying but undiagnosed conditions. Iron deficiency anaemia has been associated with most of the common pregnancy complications including pre-eclampsia, preterm birth, antepartum and postpartum haemorrhage, low birthweight and small-for-gestational age infants, and impacts long-term neurocognitive and developmental outcomes in the offspring. Increased adverse pregnancy and perinatal outcomes are also found with high haemoglobin, thalassaemia and sickle cell traits, and the non-O blood groups especially group AB. Total white cell, neutrophil, and platelet counts and platelet indices can help to predict gestational diabetes mellitus. Results from these tests can be useful by themselves or used in combination with demographics and biomarkers to enhance the screening for high-risk pregnancies.",Terence T Lao,2024

Structural insights into the DNA-binding mechanism of BCL11A: The integral role of ZnF6.,"The transcription factor BCL11A is a critical regulator of the switch from fetal hemoglobin (HbF: α<sub>2</sub>γ<sub>2</sub>) to adult hemoglobin (HbA: α<sub>2</sub>β<sub>2</sub>) during development. BCL11A binds at a cognate recognition site (TGACCA) in the γ-globin gene promoter and represses its expression. DNA-binding is mediated by a triple zinc finger domain, designated ZnF456. Here, we report comprehensive investigation of ZnF456, leveraging X-ray crystallography and NMR to determine the structures in both the presence and absence of DNA. We delve into the dynamics and mode of interaction with DNA. Moreover, we discovered that the last zinc finger of BCL11A (ZnF6) plays a different role compared to ZnF4 and 5, providing a positive entropic contribution to DNA binding and γ-globin gene repression. Comprehending the DNA binding mechanism of BCL11A opens avenues for the strategic, structure-based design of novel therapeutics targeting sickle cell disease and β-thalassemia.","Thibault Viennet, Maolu Yin, Abhilash Jayaraj, Woojin Kim, Zhen-Yu J Sun, Yuko Fujiwara, Kevin Zhang, Davide Seruggia, Hyuk-Soo Seo, Sirano Dhe-Paganon, Stuart H Orkin, Haribabu Arthanari",2024
"A novel synthetic compound, deferiprone-resveratrol hybrid (DFP-RVT), promotes hepatoprotective effects and ameliorates iron-induced oxidative stress in iron-overloaded β-thalassemic mice.","A high amount of iron in β-thalassemia patients can lead to oxidative stress and organ dysfunction, especially liver, the main iron accumulated organ. Iron catabolism causes the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), triggering liver inflammation, fibrosis, and cirrhosis. Deferiprone-resveratrol hybrid (DFP-RVT) is chemically synthesized by combining deferiprone (DFP) and resveratrol (RVT) which shows an iron-chelating property along with antioxidant activity. This study explored the hepatoprotective effect of DFP-RVT in iron overloaded β-knockout (BKO) thalassemic mice. The results revealed that DFP-RVT treatment improved liver function in iron-overloaded BKO mice by reducing liver enzymes and increasing hepcidin levels compared to iron overload control mice. Both DFP alone and DFP-RVT treatment groups demonstrated iron chelation effects by decreasing liver iron content (LIC), iron profiles, and iron deposition in the liver. Moreover, DFP-RVT powerfully showed antioxidant properties by decreasing liver and plasma thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARs) and increasing reduced glutathione (GSH) and superoxide dismutase (SOD). Interestingly, transforming growth factor β1 (TGFβ1), which can contribute to chronic liver disease through liver injury, inflammation, fibrosis, and cirrhosis, is highly expressed in iron-overloaded mice. However, both DFP and DFP-RVT treatment significantly reduced TGFβ1 levels compared to the iron-overloaded group. Therefore, DFP-RVT could be a potent hepatoprotective compound through the mobilization of iron, reduction of ROS, improvement of liver enzymes, and alleviation of liver damage, potentially relieving liver dysfunction in iron-overloaded BKO mice.","Jin Li, Hataichanok Chuljerm, Kornvipa Settakorn, Honghong Xu, Yongmin Ma, Woranontee Korsieporn, Narisara Paradee, Somdet Srichairatanakool, Pimpisid Koonyosying",2024
"Clinical implications of miRNAs in erythropoiesis, anemia, and other hematological disorders.","Erythropoiesis is regulated by the differential expression of many genes. Besides being transcriptionally regulated, these genes are also with the oath of epigenetic regulation by the microRNAs (miRNAs), in particular. Various miRNAs appear to be very important for the normal process of erythropoiesis and various hematological abnormalities in humans. Therefore, the review aims to summarize the significance of miRNAs in erythropoiesis and different hematological diseases with clinical importance. Our analysis indicates that specific miRNAs regulate erythropoiesis in a stage-specific manner from hematopoietic stem cells to differentiated erythrocytes. Further, many miRNAs have been reported to be linked with various hematological diseases. The importance of miRNAs as biomarkers or therapeutic drug targets for various hematological disorders like anemia, β-thalassemia, and leukemia has been revealed through various clinical studies and clinical trials. The miR-34a mimic and miR-155 inhibitor demonstrate promising therapeutic effects in various hematological malignancies. Additionally, miR-34a, miR-538e, miR-193e, and miR-198 exhibit diagnostic potential in acute myeloid leukemia, while miR-451, miR-151-5p, and miR-1290 show diagnostic potential in B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Thus, this review encompasses the latest observations and implications of specific miRNAs in erythropoiesis and various hematological disorders. However, challenges persist in developing safe and efficient delivery strategies to target miRNAs specifically, minimizing off-target effects and enhancing therapeutic outcomes. Future mechanistic pre-clinical and clinical research would contribute to overcoming these challenges.","Jayanta Kumar Pal, Subhayan Sur, Smriti P K Mittal, Saurabh Dey, Monali Prakash Mahale, Arijit Mukherjee",2024
β-Thalassemia Major Complicated by Acute Myeloid Leukemia.,"This report describes the rare co-occurrence of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) French-American-British type M2 in a 4.5-year-old boy with previously diagnosed thalassemia major, an inherited hemoglobinopathy, typically presenting with severe, transfusion-dependent anemia. Chronic transfusions, though lifesaving, can lead to iron overload, which may generate free radicals and potentially contribute to malignancy. Our case highlights the importance of close monitoring for secondary malignancies in thalassemia patients. Our patient born to consanguineous parents, presented with persistent fever, abdominal pain, and splenomegaly. Hematological investigations revealed severe cytopenias (low blood cell counts) and many immature blood cells (blasts). Bone marrow examination confirmed AML M2, characterized by an overabundance of myeloid blasts. Despite the initiation of myeloid leukemia-directed aggressive chemotherapy, the patient, unfortunately, succumbed to the disease within a month of diagnosis.","Mehreen Khalid, Maymoona Suhail, Alizah Faisal, Fnu Poombal",2024

Gene Therapy in Transfusion-Dependent Non-β0/β0 Genotype β-Thalassemia: First Real-World Experience of Beti-cel.,"Gene addition and editing strategies for transfusion-dependent β-thalassemia have gained momentum as potentially curative treatment options, with studies showcasing their efficacy and safety. We report the first real-world application of betibeglogene autotemcel (beti-cel; ZYNTEGLO™) during its period of active license in Europe from January 2020 to March 2022 for patients aged ≥ 12 years without a β0/β0 genotype and without a human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-matched sibling donor, before beti-cel marketing authorization was withdrawn by its holder due to non-safety reasons. Among 15 screened patients, 4 opted out for fertility and safety concerns, 2 were excluded because of marked hepatic siderosis, and 1 had apheresis collection failure. Eight patients received beti-cel post busulfan myeloablative conditioning, all achieving transfusion independence within 8 to 59 days with posttreatment hemoglobin levels ranging from 11.3 to 19.3 g/dL. No deaths occurred, but acute toxicity mirrored busulfan's known effects. Posttreatment platelet management faced challenges due to HLA-antibodies in 3 patients. Monitoring up to Month 24 revealed pituitary-gonadal endocrine dysfunction in all 3 female and in 2 of 5 male patients. Additionally, we observed unexpected posttreatment sequelae: 1 patient developed polycythemia that could not be explained by known genetic or acquired mechanisms, 1 patient developed posttreatment depression and anxiety prohibiting her from returning to work, and 1 patient developed fatigue severely compromising both quality of life and work capacity. This real-world experience corroborates beti-cel's efficacy and safety and provides information on adverse events observed during real-world use of the therapy.","Adil Mirza, Mona-Lisa Ritsert, Gloria Tao, Himal Thakar, Stephan Lobitz, Sabine Heine, Leila Koscher, Matthias Dürken, Anita Schmitt, Michael Schmitt, Petra Pavel, Sascha Laier, Donate Jakoby, Johann Greil, Joachim B Kunz, Andreas Kulozik",2024

"Routine hemostasis profile in steady state sickle cell disease adult patients compared to laboratory values, between phenotypes and during pregnancy: A retrospective, descriptive study.","Sickle cell disease is a rare genetic disease resulting from an abnormality in hemoglobin. Hemostasis in the steady state, defined as ≥2 months without vaso-occlusive crises, is poorly described in the literature. We report the routine hemostasis profile in steady state patients with sickle cell disease (SCD), including during pregnancy and according to phenotype. This retrospective study collected data over the period 2010 to 2021. Data on routine hemostasis parameters (prothrombin time [PT] activated partial thromboplastin time [aPTT], and platelets) were collected from medical records and were compared with laboratory norms including during pregnancy; the HbSS phenotype was compared with the HbSC, HbSB°thalassemia, and HbSB+thalassemia phenotypes. we included 119 adults (representing 190 day-hospitals) with SCD who had attended at least one checkup in the steady state. Seven patients (15 day-hospitals) on anticoagulants were excluded. Eleven (17 day-hospitals) were pregnant. Mean routine hemostasis parameters were within normal values regardless of pregnancy. Mean PT was lower during pregnancy (12.3 ± 0.6 s vs. 13.2 ± 1.0 s; <i>P</i> = .01). PT and platelet counts were higher (<i>P</i> = .01) and aPTT was lower (<i>P</i> = .03) in men and nonpregnant women in the HbSS group compared with those in the HbSC group. routinely collected hemostasis parameters in steady state patients were within normal laboratory values, including in pregnant women.

AZD8055 Is More Effective Than Rapamycin in Inhibiting Proliferation and Promoting Mitochondrial Clearance in Erythroid Differentiation.,"<b>Background:</b> As an important downstream effector of various signaling pathways, mTOR plays critical roles in regulating many physiological processes including erythropoiesis. It is composed of two distinct complexes, mTORC1 and mTORC2, which differ in their components and downstream signaling effects. Our previous study revealed that the inhibition of mTORC1 by rapamycin significantly repressed the erythroid progenitor expansion in the early stage but promoted enucleation and mitochondria clearance in the late stage of erythroid differentiation. However, the particular roles and differences of mTORC1 and mTORC2 in the regulation of erythropoiesis still remain largely unknown. In the present study, we investigated the comparative effects of dual mTORC1/mTORC2 mTOR kinase inhibitor AZD8055 and mTORC1 inhibitor rapamycin on erythroid differentiation in K562 cells induced by hemin and erythropoiesis in β-thalassemia mouse model. <b>Materials and Methods:</b> In vitro erythroid differentiation model of hemin-induced K562 cells and β-thalassemia mouse model were treated with AZD8055 and rapamycin. Cell Counting Kit-8 was used to detect cell viability. The cell proliferation, cell cycle, erythroid surface marker expression, mitochondrial content, and membrane potential were determined and analyzed by flow cytometry and laser scanning confocal microscopy. Globin gene expression during erythroid differentiation was measured by RT-qPCR. The mTORC2/mTORC1 and autophagy pathway was evaluated using western blotting. <b>Results:</b> Both AZD8055 and rapamycin treatments increased the expression levels of the erythroid differentiation-specific markers, CD235a, <i>α</i>-globin, <i>γ</i>-globin, and <i>ε</i>-globin. Notably, AZD8055 suppressed the cell proliferation and promoted the mitochondrial clearance of hemin-induced K562 cells more effectively than rapamycin. In a mouse model of <i>β</i>-thalassemia, both rapamycin and AZD8055 remarkably improve erythroid cell maturation and anemia. Moreover, AZD8055 and rapamycin treatment inhibited the mTORC1 pathway and enhanced autophagy, whereas AZD8055 enhanced autophagy more effectively than rapamycin. Indeed, AZD8055 treatment inhibited both mTORC2 and mTORC1 pathway in hemin-induced K562 cells. <b>Conclusion:</b> AZD8055 is more effective than rapamycin in inhibiting proliferation and promoting mitochondrial clearance in erythroid differentiation, which might provide us one more therapeutic option other than rapamycin for ineffective erythropoiesis treatment in the future. These findings also provide some preliminary information indicating the roles of mTORC1 and mTORC2 in erythropoiesis, and further studies are necessary to dissect the underlying mechanisms.","Qian Liu, Tao Hao, Ze Lin, Yipeng Fang, Lei Li, Daqi Huang, Jianbo Wu, Yanchao Zhao, Xin Zhang",2024

"Neutrophil Diversity (Immature, Aged, and Low-Density Neutrophils) and Functional Plasticity: Possible Impacts of Iron Overload in β-Thalassemia.","Neutrophil dysfunction is a form of immune suppression in patients with β-thalassemia (Beta-thal), although data on this are limited. In this study, blood from patients and healthy volunteers was analyzed. Flow cytometry analysis demonstrated an increase in immature neutrophils (CD16- CD62L+) and aged (senescent) neutrophils (CD16+ CD62L-) in Beta-thal patients compared to healthy volunteers. The Beta-thal neutrophils demonstrated less prominent chemotaxis and phagocytosis than healthy neutrophils at the baseline. With phorbol myristate acetate (PMA) or lipopolysaccharide (LPS) stimulations, some of the indicators, including the flow cytometry markers (CD11b, CD62L, CD66b, CD63, apoptosis, and reactive oxygen species) and neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs; detected by anti-citrullinated histone 3 immunofluorescence), were lower than the control. Additionally, low-density neutrophils (LDNs), which are found in the peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) fraction, were observed in Beta-thal patients but not in the control group. The expression of CD11b, CD66b, CD63, arginase I, and ROS in LDNs was higher than the regular normal-density neutrophils (NDNs). The proliferation rate of CD3+ T cells isolated from the PBMC fraction of healthy volunteers was higher than that of the cells from patients with Beta-thal. The incubation of red blood cell (RBC) lysate plus ferric ions with healthy NDNs transformed the NDNs into the aged neutrophils (decreased CD62L) and LDNs. In conclusion, iron overload induces neutrophil diversity along with some dysfunctions.","Kritsanawan Sae-Khow, Awirut Charoensappakit, Asada Leelahavanichkul",2024
Serum ferritin is a risk factor for pulmonary dysfunction in young patients with transfusion-dependent thalassemia.,"Research into the pulmonary function of patients with transfusion-dependent thalassemia (TDT) is limited, with existing studies presenting conflicting results. We carried out a retrospective study involving 140 patients with TDT. The mean patient age was 8.7 ± 3.2 years, with a median serum ferritin (SF) level of 3791.4 ng/ml (IQR: 2424.1-5733.3 ng/ml). Pulmonary function abnormalities were detected in 46.43 % (65 out of 140) of patients, primarily manifesting as diffusion dysfunction (26.43 %), followed by ventilatory dysfunction (5.0 %), and mixed pulmonary dysfunction (15.0 %). A serum ferritin level above 2500 ng/ml significantly correlated with the occurrence of these abnormalities(OR = 3.187, 95%CI:1.312-7.741, P = 0.010), while higher hemoglobin concentrations demonstrated a protective effect (OR = 0.966, 95%CI: 0.943-0.989, P = 0.004). Our study highlights diffusion dysfunction as the most prevalent type of pulmonary function abnormalities in TDT patients.

δβ-Thalassemia and α-Triplication: Is Genetic Retesting Worthwhile in Case of Non-Coherent Phenotype?,"Thalassemia is a heterogenous group of hemoglobinopathies; intermediate thalassemia's phenotype can be very variegated due to different genetic matching. Before NGS-era, diagnosis often mismatched with phenotypes, hiding some genetic findings that nowadays could completely explain clinical presentation. In this report, we emphasize the importance of reevaluating genetic testing to achieve a correct diagnosis in case of phenotype mismatch thalassemia. Starting from a suspect of δ/β thalassemia heterozygosity, reevaluating revealed heterozygosity for α-gene triplication combined to δ and β heterozygosity, a new finding that completely suited patient's clinical manifestation. This case provided the opportunity to underline that an extended study on total globin genes is essential for correct diagnosis of thalassemia, especially when clinical onset phenotypes are more divisive and questionable at a first clinical work-up.","Cristina Giubbilei, Simona D'Angelo, Ilaria Fotzi, Massimo Mogni, Paola Guglielmelli, Alessandro Maria Vannucchi, Valentina Carrai",2024
Hypercoagulability in hemoglobinopathies: Decoding the thrombotic threat.,"Beta (β)-thalassemia and sickle cell disease (SCD) are characterized by a hypercoagulable state, which can significantly influence organ complication and disease severity. While red blood cells (RBCs) and erythroblasts continue to play a central role in the pathogenesis of thrombosis in β-thalassemia and SCD, additional factors such as free heme, inflammatory vasculopathy, splenectomy, among other factors further contribute to the complexity of thrombotic risk. Thus, understanding the role of the numerous factors driving this hypercoagulable state will enable healthcare practitioners to enhance preventive and treatment strategies and develop novel therapies for the future. We herein describe the pathogenesis of thrombosis in patients with β-thalassemia and SCD. We also identify common mechanisms underlying the procoagulant profile of hemoglobinopathies translating into thrombotic events.
