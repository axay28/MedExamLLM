DYRK1A interacts with the tuberous sclerosis complex and promotes mTORC1 activity.,"DYRK1A, a ubiquitously expressed kinase<i>,</i> is linked to the dominant intellectual developmental disorder, microcephaly, and Down syndrome in humans. It regulates numerous cellular processes such as cell cycle, vesicle trafficking, and microtubule assembly. DYRK1A is a critical regulator of organ growth; however, how it regulates organ growth is not fully understood. Here, we show that the knockdown of <i>DYRK1A</i> in mammalian cells results in reduced cell size, which depends on mTORC1. Using proteomic approaches, we found that DYRK1A interacts with the tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) proteins, namely TSC1 and TSC2, which negatively regulate mTORC1 activation. Furthermore, we show that DYRK1A phosphorylates TSC2 at T1462, a modification known to inhibit TSC activity and promote mTORC1 activity. We also found that the reduced cell growth upon knockdown of DYRK1A can be rescued by overexpression of RHEB, an activator of mTORC1. Our findings suggest that DYRK1A inhibits TSC complex activity through inhibitory phosphorylation on TSC2, thereby promoting mTORC1 activity. Furthermore, using the <i>Drosophila</i> neuromuscular junction as a model, we show that the <i>mnb,</i> the fly homologs of <i>DYRK1A</i>, is rescued by RHEB overexpression, suggesting a conserved role of <i>DYRK1A</i> in TORC1 regulation.","Pinhua Wang, Sunayana Sarkar, Menghuan Zhang, Tingting Xiao, Fenhua Kong, Zhe Zhang, Deepa Balasubramanian, Nandan Jayaram, Sayantan Datta, Ruyu He, Ping Wu, Peng Chao, Ying Zhang, Michael Washburn, Laurence A Florens, Sonal Nagarkar-Jaiswal, Manish Jaiswal, Man Mohan",2024
Recent Advances in Pharmacologic Treatments of Drug-Resistant Epilepsy: Breakthrough in Sight.,"Epilepsy affects approximately 1% of the world population. Patients have recurrent seizures, increased physical and psychiatric comorbidities, and higher mortality rate than the general population. Over the last 40 years, research has resulted in 20 new antiseizure medications (ASMs) approved between 1990 and 2018. In spite of this, up to one-third of patients (~ 1 million patients in the USA) have drug-resistant epilepsy (DRE), with little change between 1982 and 2018, a period of intense new ASM development. A minority of patients with DRE may benefit from surgical treatment, but this specialized care remains challenging to scale. Therefore, the greatest hope for breakthroughs for patients with DRE is in pharmacologic therapies. Recently, several advances promise to change the outcomes for patients with DRE. Cenobamate, a drug with dual mechanisms of modulating sodium channel currents and GABA-A receptors, achieves 90-100% seizure reduction in 25-33% of patients with focal DRE, a response not observed with other ASMs. Fenfluramine, a serotonin-acting drug, dramatically reduces the frequency of convulsive seizures in Dravet syndrome, a devastating developmental epileptic encephalopathy with severe DRE. Both drugs reduce mortality. In addition, the possibility of DRE prevention was recently raised in patients with tuberous sclerosis complex, a relatively common genetic form of epilepsy. A paradigm shift is emerging in the treatment of epilepsy. Seizure freedom has become attainable in a significant proportion of patients with focal DRE, and dramatic seizure reduction has been achieved in a developmental encephalopathy. Coupled with a rich pipeline of new compounds under clinical development, the long sought-after breakthrough in the treatment of epilepsy may finally be in sight.","Pavel Klein, Daniel Friedman, Patrick Kwan",2024
Identification of a novel TSC1 variant in a family with developmental and epileptic encephalopathies: A case report and literature review.,"Tuberous sclerosis (TSC) is an autosomal dominant neurocutaneous syndrome resulting from mutations in the tumor suppressor genes TSC1 and TSC2. Unfortunately, the absence of accurate diagnosis has significantly impacted the well-being of both patients and their families. Furthermore, the pathogenicity of numerous variants remains unverified, which could potentially result in misinterpretation of their functional implications.","Chao Wang, Jin-Xia Zhai, Yong-Jun Chen",2024
Cenobamate's Efficacy for Seizure Treatment in Tuberous Sclerosis Complex.,"Epilepsy is prevalent, and seizure control is challenging in patients with tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC). Cenobamate (CBM) has proven efficacy in several studies; however, its benefit in the TSC population is not known.","Gewalin Aungaroon, Alexander Cooke, David Ritter, Darcy Krueger, Paul Horn, David N Franz",2024
Longitudinal multi-omics reveals pathogenic <i>TSC2</i> variants disrupt developmental trajectories of human cortical organoids derived from Tuberous Sclerosis Complex.,"Tuberous Sclerosis Complex (TSC), an autosomal dominant condition, is caused by heterozygous mutations in either the <i>TSC1</i> or <i>TSC2</i> genes, manifesting in systemic growth of benign tumors. In addition to brain lesions, neurologic sequelae represent the greatest morbidity in TSC patients. Investigations utilizing <i>TSC1/2</i> -knockout animal or human stem cell models suggest that TSC deficiency-causing hyper-activation of mTOR signaling might precipitate anomalous neurodevelopmental processes. However, how the pathogenic variants of <i>TSC1/2</i> genes affect the longitudinal trajectory of human brain development remains largely unexplored. Here, we employed 3-dimensional cortical organoids derived from induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) from TSC patients harboring <i>TSC2</i> variants, alongside organoids from age- and sex-matched healthy individuals as controls. Through comprehensively longitudinal molecular and cellular analyses of TSC organoids, we found that <i>TSC2</i> pathogenic variants dysregulate neurogenesis, synaptogenesis, and gliogenesis, particularly for reactive astrogliosis. The altered developmental trajectory of TSC organoids significantly resembles the molecular signatures of neuropsychiatric disorders, including autism spectrum disorders, epilepsy, and intellectual disability. Intriguingly, single cell transcriptomic analyses on TSC organoids revealed that <i>TSC2</i> pathogenic variants disrupt the neuron/reactive astrocyte crosstalk within the NLGN-NRXN signaling network. Furthermore, cellular and electrophysiological assessments of TSC cortical organoids, along with proteomic analyses of synaptosomes, demonstrated that the <i>TSC2</i> variants precipitate perturbations in synaptic transmission, neuronal network activity, mitochondrial translational integrity, and neurofilament formation. Notably, similar perturbations were observed in surgically resected cortical specimens from TSC patients. Collectively, our study illustrates that disease-associated <i>TSC2</i> variants disrupt the neurodevelopmental trajectories through perturbations of gene regulatory networks during early cortical development, leading to mitochondrial dysfunction, aberrant neurofilament formation, impaired synaptic formation and neuronal network activity.","Weibo Niu, Shaojun Yu, Xiangru Li, Zhen Wang, Rui Chen, Christina Michalski, Arman Jahangiri, Youssef Zohdy, Joshua J Chern, Ted J Whitworth, Jianjun Wang, Jie Xu, Ying Zhou, Zhaohui Qin, Bingshan Li, Michael J Gambello, Junmin Peng, Zhexing Wen",2024
Subependymal Giant Cell Astrocytoma: The Molecular Landscape and Treatment Advances.,"Subependymal giant cell astrocytoma (SEGA) is most often found in patients with TSC (Tuberous Sclerosis Complex). Although it has been classified as a benign tumor, it may create a serious medical problem leading to grave consequences, including young patient demise. Surgery and chemotherapy belong to the gold standard of treatment. A broader pharmacological approach involves the ever-growing number of rapalogs and ATP-competitive inhibitors, as well as compounds targeting other kinases, such as dual PI3K/mTOR inhibitors and CK2 kinase inhibitors. Novel approaches may utilize noncoding RNA-based therapeutics and are extensively investigated to this end. The purpose of our review was to characterize SEGA and discuss the latest trends in the diagnosis and therapy of this disease.","Emanuela Pucko, Dorota Sulejczak, Robert P Ostrowski",2024
Cannabinoids and Genetic Epilepsy Models: A Review with Focus on CDKL5 Deficiency Disorder.,"Pediatric genetic epilepsies, such as CDKL5 Deficiency Disorder (CDD), are severely debilitating, with early-onset seizures occurring more than ten times daily in extreme cases. Existing antiseizure drugs frequently prove ineffective, which significantly impacts child development and diminishes the quality of life for patients and caregivers. The relaxation of cannabis legislation has increased research into potential therapeutic properties of phytocannabinoids such as cannabidiol (CBD) and Δ9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC). CBD's antiseizure properties have shown promise, particularly in treating drug-resistant genetic epilepsies associated with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (LGS), Dravet syndrome (DS), and Tuberous Sclerosis Complex (TSC). However, specific research on CDD remains limited. Much of the current evidence relies on anecdotal reports of artisanal products lacking accurate data on cannabinoid composition. Utilizing model systems like patient-derived iPSC neurons and brain organoids allows precise dosing and comprehensive exploration of cannabinoids' pharmacodynamics. This review explores the potential of CBD, THC, and other trace cannabinoids in treating CDD and focusing on clinical trials and preclinical models to elucidate the cannabinoid's potential mechanisms of action in disrupted CDD pathways and strengthen the case for further research into their potential as anti-epileptic drugs for CDD. This review offers an updated perspective on cannabinoid's therapeutic potential for CDD.","Sean Massey, Anita Quigley, Simone Rochfort, John Christodoulou, Nicole J Van Bergen",2024

Multisystem diseases in the abdomen and pelvis: imaging manifestations and diagnostic roles of cross-sectional imaging.,"Systemic diseases, such as IgG4-related disease, sarcoidosis, and amyloidosis, usually involve multiple systems or organs simultaneously or sequentially. The gastrointestinal tract, hepatobiliary system, and genitourinary tract are commonly involved in many multisystem diseases and can also be the first sites with disease involvement. Cross-sectional imaging, such as CT and MR, plays an important role in the diagnosis and management of multisystem diseases by aiding in the evaluation of multiorgan involvement. Here, common imaging features of frequently affected organs are reviewed in multisystem diseases that we often encounter in the abdomen and pelvis, and the diagnostic roles of cross-sectional imaging for these diseases are also discussed.","Mi Hye Yu, Young Jun Kim, Sungeun Park, Hee Sun Park, Sung Il Jung",2024
MicroRNA-451 from Human Umbilical Cord-Derived Mesenchymal Stem Cell Exosomes Inhibits Alveolar Macrophage Autophagy <i>via</i> Tuberous Sclerosis Complex 1/Mammalian Target of Rapamycin Pathway to Attenuate Burn-Induced Acute Lung Injury in Rats.,Our previous studies established that microRNA (miR)-451 from human umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cell-derived exosomes (hUC-MSC-Exos) alleviates acute lung injury (ALI).

Angiomyolipomatous Lesions of the Nasal Cavity (Sinonasal Angioleiomyoma with Adipocytic Differentiation): A Multi-Institutional Immunohistochemical and Molecular Study.,"Mesenchymal neoplasms composed of vascular, smooth muscle, and adipocytic components are uncommon in the nasal cavity. While angioleiomyoma (AL) is a smooth muscle tumor in the Head & Neck WHO classification, it is considered of pericytic origin in the Skin as well as Soft Tissue and Bone classifications. For nasal AL with an adipocytic component, the terms AL with adipocytic differentiation and angiomyolipoma (AML) have been applied, among others. AML is a type of perivascular epithelioid cell tumor (PEComa), most often arising in the kidney, sometimes associated with the tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC). It is uncertain whether nasal cavity AML and AL are best considered hamartomas or neoplasms, as their genetics are largely unexplored.","Victoria M Jones, Lester D R Thompson, Jason R Pettus, Donald C Green, Joel A Lefferts, Parth S Shah, Gregory J Tsongalis, Dipti P Sajed, Julie M Guilmette, James S Lewis, Adam S Fisch, Laura J Tafe, Darcy A Kerr",2024

"Autism Spectrum Disorder Symptom Profiles in Fragile X Syndrome, Angelman Syndrome, Tuberous Sclerosis Complex and Neurofibromatosis Type 1.","Studying Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) heterogeneity in biologically homogeneous samples may increase our knowledge of ASD etiology. Fragile X syndrome (FXS), Angelman syndrome (AS), Tuberous Sclerosis Complex (TSC), and Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) are monogenic disorders with high a prevalence of ASD symptomatology. This study aimed to identify ASD symptom profiles in a large group of children and adolescents (0;9-28 years) with FXS, AS, TSC, and NF1. Data on ASD symptomatology (Autism Diagnostic Observation Scale (ADOS-2) & Social Responsiveness Scale (SRS-2)) were collected from children and adolescents with FXS (n = 54), AS (n = 93), TSC (n = 112), and NF1 (n = 278). To identify groups of individuals with similar ASD profiles, we performed two latent profile analyses. We identified a four-profile model based on the ADOS-2, with a (1) 'Non-spectrum symptom profile', (2) 'Social Affect symptom profile', (3)'Restricted/Repetitive Behaviors symptom profile', and (4)'ASD symptom profile'. We also identified a four-profile model based on the SRS, with a (1)'Non-clinical symptom profile', (2)'Mild symptom profile', (3)'Moderate symptom profile', and (4)'Severe symptom profile'. Although each syndrome group exhibited varying degrees of severity, they also displayed heterogeneity in the profiles in which they were classified. We found distinct ASD symptom profiles in a population consisting of children and adolescents with FXS, AS, TSC, and NF1. Our study highlights the importance of a personalized approach to the identification and management of ASD symptoms in rare genetic syndromes. Future studies should aim to include more domains of functioning and investigate the stability of latent profiles over time.","Kyra Lubbers, Kamil R Hiralal, Gwendolyn C Dieleman, Doesjka A Hagenaar, Bram Dierckx, Jeroen S Legerstee, Pieter F A de Nijs, André B Rietman, Rianne Oostenbrink, Karen G C B Bindels-de Heus, Marie-Claire Y de Wit, Manon H J Hillegers, Leontine W Ten Hoopen, Sabine E Mous",2024

Neuromodulation strategies in developmental and epileptic encephalopathies.,"Developmental and epileptic encephalopathies (DEEs) are a group of childhood-onset epilepsy syndromes characterized by frequent seizures, severe cognitive and behavioral impairments, and poor long-term outcomes. These conditions are typically refractory to currently available medical therapies, prompting recent exploration of neuromodulation treatments such as deep brain stimulation (DBS) and responsive neurostimulation (RNS), which aim to modulate epileptic networks spanning cortical and subcortical regions. These advances have occurred alongside an improved understanding of syndrome-specific and interictal epileptiform discharge/seizure-specific brain networks. By targeting key nodes within these networks, DBS and RNS hold promise for influencing seizures and associated cognitive and behavioral comorbidities. Initial experiences with centromedian (CM) thalamic DBS for Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (LGS) have shown modest efficacy across multiple seizure types. Reports also indicate the application of DBS and RNS across various genetic and structural etiologies commonly associated with DEEs, with mixed success. Although DBS and RNS are increasingly used in LGS and other DEEs, their mixed efficacy highlights a knowledge gap in understanding why some patients with LGS do not respond and which neuromodulation approach is most effective for other DEEs. To address these issues, this review first discusses recent neuroimaging studies showing similarities and differences in the epileptic brain networks underlying various DEEs, revealing the common involvement of the thalamus and the default-mode network (DMN) across multiple DEEs. We then examine thalamic DBS for LGS to illustrate how such network insights may be used to optimize neuromodulation. Although network-based neuromodulation is still in its infancy, the LGS model may serve as a framework for other DEEs, where optimal treatment necessitates consideration of the underlying epileptic networks. Lastly, the review suggests future research directions, including individualized connectivity assessment and biomarker identification through collaborative efforts, which may enhance the therapeutic potential of neuromodulation for individuals living with DEEs.","Debopam Samanta, Zulfi Haneef, Gregory W Albert, Sunil Naik, Puck C Reeders, Puneet Jain, Taylor J Abel, Ruba Al-Ramadhani, George M Ibrahim, Aaron E L Warren",2024
"A case report and review of rheumatoid arthritis co-occurring with tuberous sclerosis complex, a rare occurrence.","Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a common autoimmune disease. Tuberous sclerosis complex(TSC) is a rare autosomal dominant disorder. We report a case of RA with TSC. The patient was a 46-year-old woman with polyarthritis and cough symptoms, rheumatoid arthritis associated interstitial lung disease (RA-ILD) was initially considered, and after more than 3 months of anti-rheumatic treatment, the patient still had cough, and further examination revealed that the patient had lymphangioleiomyomatosis in the lungs, hepatic and renal angiomyolipomas, multiple subependymal nodules, Vertebral osteosclerotic nodules, as well as facial angiofibromas and periungual fibroma, RA was finally diagnosed with TSC, and everolimus 10mg qd was added to anti-rheumatic therapy for 1 month, and the patient's cough symptoms were relieved.","Hai-Qin Yin, Xue-Fei Li, Yao Fu, Hui-Ling Zhu, Yu-Sheng Luo",2024
"Tuberous sclerosis complex: Diagnostic features, surveillance, and therapeutic strategies.","Tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) is a rare neurocutaneous disorder of mTOR pathway dysregulation resulting from pathogenic variants in the TSC1 or TSC2 genes. Expression of this disorder may involve abnormal tissue growth and dysfunction within the brain, kidneys, heart, lungs, eyes, skin, bones, and teeth. Neurological manifestations can include subependymal giant cell astrocytomas (SEGAs), high rates of infantile spasms, drug-resistant epilepsy, developmental delay, cognitive impairment, autism spectrum disorder, and other neurobehavioral manifestations. Here we review the potential clinical manifestations of TSC by system, recommended diagnostic and surveillance testing, genetic testing, currently available therapeutic options, and considerations for education and social support resources given the unique challenges of this multi-system disorder.","Kristen H Arredondo, Kristina Jülich, E Steve Roach",2024
Genetic principles related to neurocutaneous disorders.,"A detailed understanding of genetics is critical to the diagnosis, management, and prognostication of neurocutaneous disorders. Inheritance patterns can provide a key to the identification of different neurocutaneous disorders. Autosomal dominant disorders, like neurofibromatosis type 1 and tuberous sclerosis complex, affect males and females equally and are typically seen in every generation of a pedigree due to pathogenic changes to one copy of a gene on a somatic chromosome. Autosomal recessive disorders, such as ataxia-telangiectasia, affect males and females equally but typically skip generations on pedigrees as there needs to be a pathogenic variant of the gene on each of the pair of somatic chromosomes. X-linked disorders such as incontinentia pigmenti and Fabry disease primarily affect males or affect them more severely, but in the case of incontinentia pigmenti, the condition is lethal in males and only females are noted to be affected. The pathogenic variant that is disease causing is on the X sex chromosome, of which females have two and males have one. Somatic mosaic disorders like Sturge Weber syndrome are due to pathogenic variants only in a subset of cells post-fertilization and are not present in gametes, and so are not passed on to the next generation. Conditions that are a result of germline mosaicism are usually identified as autosomal dominant conditions that have not been present in the family prior to a single child being affected, with suspicion strengthening if siblings are diagnosed with the same condition. Regardless of the suspected inheritance pattern, it is essential to consider the ethical implications of genetic testing, including family planning, discovery of consanguinity, disclosure to other potentially affected family members, and diagnostic uncertainty.","Leah Ferrante, Chelsey Ortman",2024
Spontaneous angiomyolipoma rupture: A case of hemorrhagic shock and urgent embolization.,"This case report discusses a 64-year-old male with tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC), a genetic disorder characterized by benign tumor formation across multiple organ systems. The patient presented with a spontaneous hemorrhage from a right renal angiomyolipoma, a common and potentially life-threatening manifestation of TSC, particularly in patients with TSC2 mutations. The patient's significant comorbidities, including hypertension and dyslipidemia, further complicated his clinical course. Initial management involved aggressive fluid resuscitation and blood product transfusion, followed by urgent embolization to control active bleeding. Despite developing complications such as transfusion-associated circulatory overload (TACO), the patient was successfully stabilized. This case highlights the necessity for careful monitoring and prompt intervention in patients with TSC, given the high risk of hemorrhage from angiomyolipomas, especially those larger than 3 cm. We also emphasize the importance of differentiating TSC-associated angiomyolipomas from other renal masses, considering the variability in clinical presentation and the potential for late-onset symptoms. Additionally, it highlights the critical role of a multidisciplinary approach in managing TSC patients, addressing both acute complications and long-term surveillance to prevent recurrence and other systemic manifestations of the disease.","Ameer Awashra, Zaid Sawaftah, Fathi Milhem, Dawoud Hamdan, Ali Bani Odah, Ahmad Sawafta, Ola Ahmad, Jehad Khamaysa, Mohammed Khader, Omar Naseef",2024
AKT-mediated phosphorylation of TSC2 controls stimulus- and tissue-specific mTORC1 signaling and organ growth.,"Mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) complex 1 (mTORC1) integrates diverse intracellular and extracellular growth signals to regulate cell and tissue growth. How the molecular mechanisms regulating mTORC1 signaling established through biochemical and cell biological studies function under physiological states in specific mammalian tissues are unknown. Here, we characterize a genetic mouse model lacking the 5 phosphorylation sites on the tuberous sclerosis complex 2 (TSC2) protein through which the growth factor-stimulated protein kinase AKT can active mTORC1 signaling in cell culture models. These phospho-mutant mice (TSC2-5A) are developmentally normal but exhibit reduced body weight and the weight of specific organs, such as brain and skeletal muscle, associated with cell intrinsic decreases in growth factor-stimulated mTORC1 signaling. The TSC2-5A mouse model demonstrates that TSC2 phosphorylation is a primary mechanism of mTORC1 activation in some, but not all, tissues and provides a genetic tool to facilitate studies on the physiological regulation of mTORC1.","Yann Cormerais, Samuel C Lapp, Krystle C Kalafut, Madi Y Cissé, Jong Shin, Benjamin Stefadu, Jean Personnaz, Sandra Schrotter, Angelica D'Amore, Emma R Martin, Catherine L Salussolia, Mustafa Sahin, Suchithra Menon, Vanessa Byles, Brendan D Manning",2024

Radiosensitivity in individuals with tuberous sclerosis complex.,"Benign tumors, but rarely cancer, are common in patients with tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC). Blood samples from patients undergoing treatment for TSC at our institution were analyzed for their individual sensitivity to ionizing radiation. Blood samples were collected from 13 adult patients with TSC. The samples were irradiated ex vivo and analyzed by 3-color fluorescence in situ hybridization. In each patient, aberrations were analyzed in 200 metaphases of chromosomes 1, 2, and 4 and scored as breaks. Radiosensitivity was determined by mean breaks per metaphase (B/M) and compared to both healthy donors and oncologic patients. The radiosensitivity (B/M) of the TSC patient cohort (n = 13; female: 46.2%, B/M: 0.48 ± 0.11) was clearly increased compared to healthy individuals of similar age (n = 90; female: 54.4%; B/M: 0.40 ± 0.09; p = 0.001). There was no difference compared to age-matched oncological patients (n = 78; female: 67.9%; B/M 0.49 ± 0.14; p = 0.246). Similarly, the proportion of radiosensitive (B/M > 0.5) and distinctly radiosensitive individuals (B/M > 0.6) was increased in the TSC and oncological patient cohorts (TSC: 30.8% and 7.7%, oncological patients: 46.2% and 14.1%) compared to the healthy individuals (11.1% and 2.2%). Although patients with TSC develop mostly benign and rarely malignant tumors, they are similarly sensitive to radiation as patients with malignant tumors.","Lukas Kuhlmann, Jenny Stritzelberger, Rainer Fietkau, Luitpold V Distel, Hajo M Hamer",2024

Gastrointestinal Symptoms in Autism Spectrum Disorder: A Case-Control Study.,"Background and objectives This study aimed to explore the frequency of gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms and associated risk factors among children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Methods This was a retrospective case-control study including children aged 2-14 years diagnosed with ASD by the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM)-5 criteria and the assessment card in the ASD center at King Salman Armed Forces Hospital. Data were obtained using a self-developed questionnaire that included demographic features, nutritional and behavioral characteristics, and GI symptoms in the previous six months. The control group consisted of typically developing (TD) children matched to the ASD group for age and gender. Syndromic autism with defined somatic abnormalities and recognized genetic causes (e.g., fragile X syndrome, tuberous sclerosis) were excluded Results A total of 146 ASD children and 114 normal children were included. No significant demographic differences were found between the groups. The ASD group had a higher frequency of low income and a significantly lower rate of exclusive breastfeeding in the first six months. GI symptoms, specifically constipation, abdominal gases and distension, diarrhea, undigested food particles in stool, and mouth ulcers, were significantly more frequent in the ASD group. Weight abnormalities (both increase and decrease) were also more common. Family history of ASD was significantly more in ASD children with GI symptoms while low maternal education was more in those without. Conclusion This study reveals a high prevalence of GI symptoms in ASD children. Family history of ASD and maternal education may influence the GI symptoms reported in ASD children.","Khaled Alqoaer, Maryam O Alenzi, Doha Abuharfel, Aziza Alenazi",2024
