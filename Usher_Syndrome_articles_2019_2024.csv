Intestinal Tuft Cells Are Enriched With Protocadherins.,"Intestinal tuft cells are rare cells that regulate diverse functions. They harbor chemosensory receptors and signal to the mucosal immune system in response to external stimuli, though their full function and structure remain unclear. Named for their apical ""tuft"" of long actin-rich microvilli, tuft cells facilitate chemoreception and other physiological responses. In enterocytes, microvilli are stabilized by intermicrovillar adhesion complexes (IMACs) composed of several proteins, including cadherin-related family member-2 (CDHR2) and cadherin-related family member-5 (CDHR5), Myosin 7b, and Usher syndrome type 1 C (USH1C). We hypothesized that IMACs would be enriched in tuft cells to regulate microvillar organization. Immunostaining of murine intestinal tissue revealed that CDHR2 and CDHR5 colocalize with the tuft cell markers, DCLK1, phospho-EGFR, advillin, and cytokeratin 18. CDHR2 was dispersed throughout murine tuft cells, while CDHR5 was concentrated on the apical surface. USH1C and Myosin 7b were present in tuft cells, but at lower levels. Human single-cell RNA sequencing revealed robust CDHR2 and CDHR5 expression in tuft cells in the small intestine and colon. Immunostaining of human intestinal tissue confirmed CDHR2 and CDHR5 localization to the apical surface of tuft cells. Our findings demonstrate that protocadherins are key components of murine and human intestinal tuft cells.","Rachel Stubler, Sarah A Dooley, Rachel Edens, Maribeth R Nicholson, Amy C Engevik",2024
Genotype Characterization and MiRNA Expression Profiling in Usher Syndrome Cell Lines.,"Usher syndrome (USH) is an inherited disorder characterized by sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL), retinitis pigmentosa (RP)-related vision loss, and vestibular dysfunction. USH presents itself as three distinct clinical types, 1, 2, and 3, with no biomarker for early detection. This study aimed to explore whether microRNA (miRNA) expression in USH cell lines is dysregulated compared to the miRNA expression pattern in a cell line derived from a healthy human subject. Lymphocytes from USH patients and healthy individuals were isolated and transformed into stable cell lines using Epstein-Barr virus (EBV). DNA from these cell lines was sequenced using a targeted panel to identify gene variants associated with USH types 1, 2, and 3. Microarray analysis was performed on RNA from both USH and control cell lines using NanoString miRNA microarray technology. Dysregulated miRNAs identified by the microarray were validated using droplet digital PCR technology. DNA sequencing revealed that two USH patients had USH type 1 with gene variants in USH1B (<i>MYO7A</i>) and USH1D (<i>CDH23</i>), while the other two patients were classified as USH type 2 (<i>USH2A</i>) and USH type 3 (<i>CLRN-1</i>), respectively. The NanoString miRNA microarray detected 92 differentially expressed miRNAs in USH cell lines compared to controls. Significantly altered miRNAs exhibited at least a twofold increase or decrease with a <i>p</i> value below 0.05. Among these miRNAs, 20 were specific to USH1, 14 to USH2, and 5 to USH3. Three miRNAs that are known as miRNA-183 family which are crucial for inner ear and retina development, have been significantly downregulated as compared to control cells. Subsequently, droplet digital PCR assays confirmed the dysregulation of the 12 most prominent miRNAs in USH cell lines. This study identifies several miRNA signatures in USH cell lines which may have potential utility in Usher syndrome identification.","Wesley A Tom, Dinesh S Chandel, Chao Jiang, Gary Krzyzanowski, Nirmalee Fernando, Appolinaire Olou, M Rohan Fernando",2024

MultiBac System-based Purification and Biophysical Characterization of Human Myosin-7a.,"Myosin-7a is an actin-based motor protein vital for auditory and visual processes. Mutations in myosin-7a lead to Usher syndrome type 1, the most common and severe form of deaf-blindness in humans. It is hypothesized that myosin-7a forms a transmembrane adhesion complex with other Usher proteins, essential for the structural-functional integrity of photoreceptor and cochlear hair cells. However, due to the challenges in obtaining pure, intact protein, the exact functional mechanisms of human myosin-7a remain elusive, with limited structural and biomechanical studies available. Recent studies have shown that mammalian myosin-7a is a multimeric motor complex consisting of a heavy chain and three types of light chains: regulatory light chain (RLC), calmodulin, and calmodulin-like protein 4 (CALML4). Unlike calmodulin, CALML4 does not bind to calcium ions. Both the calcium-sensitive, and insensitive calmodulins are critical for mammalian myosin-7a for proper fine-tuning of its mechanical properties. Here, we describe a detailed method to produce recombinant human myosin-7a holoenzyme using the MultiBac Baculovirus protein expression system. This yields milligram quantities of high-purity full-length protein, allowing for its biochemical and biophysical characterization. We further present a protocol for assessing its mechanical and motile properties using tailored in vitro motility assays and fluorescence microscopy. The availability of the intact human myosin-7a protein, along with the detailed functional characterization protocol described here, paves the way for further investigations into the molecular aspects of myosin-7a in vision and hearing.","Marvin Wright, Shayna Redford, Jacob Vehar, Kevin C Courtney, Neil Billington, Rong Liu",2024

Mucopolysaccharidosis Type IIIE: A Real Human Disease or a Diagnostic Pitfall?,"Mucopolysaccharidoses (MPS) comprise a group of 12 metabolic disorders where defects in specific enzyme activities lead to the accumulation of glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) within lysosomes. This classification expands to 13 when considering MPS IIIE. This type of MPS, associated with pathogenic variants in the <i>ARSG</i> gene, has thus far been described only in the context of animal models. However, pathogenic variants in this gene also occur in humans, but are linked to a different disorder, Usher syndrome (USH) type IV, which is sparking increasing debate. This paper gathers, discusses, and summarizes arguments both for and against classifying dysfunctions of arylsulfatase G (due to pathogenic variants in the <i>ARSG</i> gene) in humans as another subtype of MPS, called MPS IIIE. Specific difficulties in diagnostics and the classification of some inherited metabolic diseases are also highlighted and discussed.","Karolina Wiśniewska, Jakub Wolski, Magdalena Żabińska, Aneta Szulc, Lidia Gaffke, Karolina Pierzynowska, Grzegorz Węgrzyn",2024
Expanding the genetic landscape of Usher syndrome type IV caused by pathogenic ARSG variants.,"Usher syndrome (USH) is the most common cause of deafblindness. USH is autosomal recessively inherited and characterized by rod-cone dystrophy or retinitis pigmentosa (RP), often accompanied by sensorineural hearing loss. Variants in >15 genes have been identified as causative for clinically and genetically distinct subtypes. Among the ultra-rare and recently discovered genes is ARSG, coding for the lysosomal sulfatase Arylsulfatase G. This subtype was assigned as ""USH IV"" with a late onset of RP and usually late-onset progressive SNHL without vestibular involvement. Here, we describe nine new subjects and the clinical description of four cases with the USH IV phenotype bearing seven novel and two known pathogenic variants. Functional experiments indicated the complete loss of sulfatase enzymatic activity upon ectopic expression of mutated ARSG cDNA. Interestingly, we identified a homozygous missense variant, p.(Arg99His), previously described in dogs with neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis. Our study expands the genetic landscape of ARSG-USH IV and the number of known subjects by more than 30%. These findings highlight that USH IV likely has been underdiagnosed and emphasize the need to test molecularly unresolved subjects with deafblindness syndrome. Finally, testing of ARSG should be considered for the genetic work-up of apparent isolated inherited retinal diseases.","Miriam Bauwens, Vincent De Man, Isabelle Audo, Irina Balikova, Wadih M Zein, Vasily Smirnov, Sebastian Held, Sascha Vermeer, Elke Loos, Julie Jacob, Ingele Casteels, Julie Désir, Fanny Depasse, Stijn Van de Sompele, Mattias Van Heetvelde, Marieke De Bruyne, Camille Andrieu, Christel Condroyer, Aline Antonio, Robert Hufnagel, Ana Luísa Carvalho, João Pedro Marques, Christina Zeitz, Elfride De Baere, Markus Damme",2024
Concomitant ulcerative colitis and Usher syndrome in a Pakistani patient: A novel case report.,"Ulcerative colitis (UC) and Usher syndrome (USH) are debilitating diseases, compromising quality of life. Globally, half a million cases of UC have been reported, whereas USH is the leading cause of genetic deaf-blindness worldwide. The combined occurrence of both these diseases together is extremely rare. In this one-of-a-kind case report, we discuss the implication of a limited resource-setting on the diagnosis of those diseases. A 33-year-old Southeast Asian male, a known case of hepatitis C presented with a chronic reduction of vision and hearing loss and an acute presentation of loose stools, abdominal pain, and weight loss for 4-7 months. Raised inflammatory markers were reported with a C-Reactive Protein (CRP) level of 64.8 mg/dL. Ultrasound of the abdomen revealed mild abdominopelvic ascites. Colonoscopy showed multiple polyps and was biopsied to have fragments of colonic mucosa with moderate active colitis along with ulcer slough. A Computed Tomography (CT) scan with contrast of the abdomen and pelvis suggested thickened bowel, findings all suggestive of UC. For hearing and sight loss, fundoscopy showed retinitis pigmentosa (RP), and pure tone audiometry suggested bilateral sensorineural hearing loss. A probable diagnosis of mild UC and type II USH was made on clinical examination, radiological imaging, and histopathological sampling. UC and USH have genetic mutations that contribute to the disease manifestations; however, none occur mutually. UC has ophthalmic extraintestinal manifestations, but RP, which is the main reported manifestation in USH, is rarely reported in UC. Maximum efforts were exercised in diagnosing and managing the patient effectively despite the limited resources available. The coexisting USH and UC diagnosis in this patient presents as a rare case. More research is needed to further determine a shared immunological basis of the two disease etiologies and therapeutic advancement.","Fatima Zulfiqar Siddiqui, Anusha Ashkar, Saira Maryam Aamir",2024
Usher Syndrome Type 2 in An Iranian Family: A Novel Founder Variation in The <i>USH2A</i> Gene.,"This study delves into Usher syndrome type 2 (USH2), an uncommon genetic disorder characterized by sensorineural hearing loss (HL) and retinitis pigmentosa (RP), often associated with the <i>USH2A</i> gene. Focusing on an Iranian family exhibiting USH2 symptoms, exome-sequencing was employed for a comprehensive genome analysis in a 30-yearold patient. The investigation unveiled a novel variation (NM_206933.4: c.9389G>A; p.Trp3130*) within exon 48 of the <i>USH2A</i> gene, a previously unreported variant emphasizing the genetic diversity in USH2. Sanger sequencing was then utilized to assess variation segregation within the family, offering insights into the inheritance pattern. This discovery not only advances our understanding of the genetic basis of USH2 but also holds significant implications for genetic counseling, early management, and informed decision-making regarding prenatal options. By adopting an integrated approach, this study aims to empower affected families, facilitating a nuanced understanding of the disorder's complexities and ultimately improving patient outcomes and family well-being through informed decisionmaking and proactive management strategies.","Mostafa Neissi, Javad Mohammadi-Asl, Misagh Mohammadi-Asl, Mojdeh Roghani, Motahareh Sheikh-Hosseini, Adnan Issa Al-Badran",2024
A novel compound heterozygous variant of MYO7A in Usher syndrome type 1.,"Usher syndrome (USH) is a recessive genetic disorder manifested by congenital sensorineural hearing loss and progressive retinitis pigmentosa, which leads to audiovisual impairment. We report a patient with Usher syndrome type 1 with new compound heterozygous MYO7A variants. A total of four members from the USH family were included. Medical history and retinal examinations were taken and genomic DNA from peripheral blood was extracted in the proband and other members. 381 retinal disease-associated genes were screened using targeted sequence capture array technology and Sanger sequencing was used to confirm the screening results. Scanning laser ophthalmoscope showed bone spicule pigmentary deposits in the mid-peripheral retina and whitish and thin retinal blood vessels especially in the arterioles. Optical coherence tomography showed that the centrality of the macular ellipsoid band disappeared in both eyes, and only remained near the fovea. Visual field examination showed a progressive loss of the visual field in a concentric pattern in both eyes. The electroretinography showed a significant decrease in the amplitudes of a- and b-waves in the scotopic and photopic condition. DNA sequencing identified the compound heterozygous variants including c.1003+1G > A: p. (?) and c.5957_5958del: p.G1987Lfs*50 of MYO7A, with the latter being novel. In this study, we found a novel compound heterozygous variant in MYO7A, which enriched the mutation spectrum and expanded our understanding of the heterogeneity of phenotype and genotype of Usher syndrome type 1.","Wenchao Cao, Longhao Kuang, Run Gan, Tao Huang, Xiaohe Yan",2024
Investigating Splice Defects in <i>USH2A</i> Using Targeted Long-Read Sequencing.,"Biallelic variants in <i>USH2A</i> are associated with retinitis pigmentosa (RP) and Type 2 Usher Syndrome (USH2), leading to impaired vision and, additionally, hearing loss in the latter. Although the introduction of next-generation sequencing into clinical diagnostics has led to a significant uplift in molecular diagnostic rates, many patients remain molecularly unsolved. It is thought that non-coding variants or variants of uncertain significance contribute significantly to this diagnostic gap. This study aims to demonstrate the clinical utility of the reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR)-Oxford Nanopore Technology (ONT) sequencing of <i>USH2A</i> mRNA transcripts from nasal epithelial cells to determine the splice-altering effect of candidate variants. Five affected individuals with USH2 or non-syndromic RP who had undergone whole genome sequencing were recruited for further investigation. All individuals had uncertain genotypes in <i>USH2A</i>, including deep intronic rare variants, c.8682-654C>G, c.9055+389G>A, and c.9959-2971C>T; a synonymous variant of uncertain significance, c.2139C>T; p.(Gly713=); and a predicted loss of function duplication spanning an intron/exon boundary, c.3812-3_3837dup p.(Met1280Ter). In silico assessment using SpliceAI provided splice-altering predictions for all candidate variants which were investigated using ONT sequencing. All predictions were found to be accurate; however, in the case of c.3812-3_3837dup, the outcome was a complex cryptic splicing pattern with predominant in-frame exon 18 skipping and a low level of exon 18 inclusion leading to the predicted stop gain. This study detected and functionally characterised simple and complex mis-splicing patterns in <i>USH2A</i> arising from previously unknown deep intronic variants and previously reported variants of uncertain significance, confirming the pathogenicity of the variants.","Shwetha Chandrasekhar, Siying Lin, Neringa Jurkute, Kathryn Oprych, Leire Estramiana Elorrieta, Elena Schiff, Samantha Malka, Genevieve Wright, Michel Michaelides, Omar A Mahroo, Andrew R Webster, Gavin Arno",2024

Long-Term Outcomes of Cochlear Implantation in Usher Syndrome.,"Usher syndrome (USH), characterized by bilateral sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL) and retinitis pigmentosa (RP), prompts increased reliance on hearing due to progressive visual deterioration. It can be categorized into three subtypes: USH type 1 (USH1), characterized by severe to profound congenital SNHL, childhood-onset RP, and vestibular areflexia; USH type 2 (USH2), presenting with moderate to severe progressive SNHL and RP onset in the second decade, with or without vestibular dysfunction; and USH type 3 (USH3), featuring variable progressive SNHL beginning in childhood, variable RP onset, and diverse vestibular function. Previous studies evaluating cochlear implant (CI) outcomes in individuals with USH used varying or short follow-up durations, while others did not evaluate outcomes for each subtype separately. This study evaluates long-term CI performance in subjects with USH, at both short-term and long-term, considering each subtype separately.","Mirthe L A Fehrmann, Cris P Lanting, Lonneke Haer-Wigman, Helger G Yntema, Emmanuel A M Mylanus, Wendy J Huinck, Ronald J E Pennings",N/A

A Case Report on Senear-Usher Syndrome.,"Pemphigus erythematosus is an uncommon autoimmune bullous skin disorder with clinical, histological, and serological characteristics that overlap with lupus erythematosus and pemphigus foliaceus. The autoantigens are desmoglein 3, desmoglein 1, and desmosomal adhesion proteins in keratinocytes. When these bonds are disrupted, it causes acantholysis of keratinocytes, leading to the fluid collection between layers. Hence, the patient will present clinically with small flaccid bullae with crusting and scaling, mainly on the seborrheic areas. We report the case of a 21-year-old female presenting to us with multiple hyperkeratotic plaques, mainly on the seborrheic areas, including the face, chest, and elbows. The patient was evaluated further, and based on clinical and laboratory investigations, the diagnosis of pemphigus erythematosus associated with anti-double-stranded deoxyribonucleic acid (anti-dSDNA) and anti-nuclear antibody (ANA) positivity was made. The patient was then managed using immunosuppressant therapy, and the entire course has been detailed in this case report.","Shivani D Jangid, Bhushan Madke, Adarshlata Singh, Drishti M Bhatt, Arshiya Khan",2023
Elasticity and Thermal Stability are Key Determinants of Hearing Rescue by Mini-Protocadherin-15 Proteins.,"Protocadherin-15 is a core protein component of inner-ear hair-cell tip links pulling on transduction channels essential for hearing and balance. Protocadherin-15 defects can result in non-syndromic deafness or Usher syndrome type 1F (USH1F) with hearing loss, balance deficits, and progressive blindness. Three rationally engineered shortened versions of protocadherin-15 (mini-PCDH15s) amenable for gene therapy have been used to rescue function in USH1F mouse models. Two can successfully or partially rescue hearing, while another one fails. Here we show that despite varying levels of hearing rescue, all three mini-PCDH15 versions can rescue hair-cell mechanotransduction. Negative-stain electron microscopy shows that all three versions form dimers like the wild-type protein, while crystal structures of some engineered fragments show that these can properly fold and bind calcium ions essential for function. In contrast, simulations predict distinct elasticities and nano differential scanning fluorimetry shows differences in melting temperature measurements. Our data suggest that elasticity and thermal stability are key determinants of sustained hearing rescue by mini-PCDH15s.","Pedro De-la-Torre, Haosheng Wen, Joseph Brower, Karina Martínez-Pérez, Yoshie Narui, Frank Yeh, Evan Hale, Maryna V Ivanchenko, David P Corey, Marcos Sotomayor, Artur A Indzhykulian",2024

"Mice with deficiency in Pcdh15, a gene associated with bipolar disorders, exhibit significantly elevated diurnal amplitudes of locomotion and body temperature.","Genetic factors significantly affect the pathogenesis of psychiatric disorders. However, the specific pathogenic mechanisms underlying these effects are not fully understood. Recent extensive genomic studies have implicated the protocadherin-related 15 (PCDH15) gene in the onset of psychiatric disorders, such as bipolar disorder (BD). To further investigate the pathogenesis of these psychiatric disorders, we developed a mouse model lacking Pcdh15. Notably, although PCDH15 is primarily identified as the causative gene of Usher syndrome, which presents with visual and auditory impairments, our mice with Pcdh15 homozygous deletion (Pcdh15-null) did not exhibit observable structural abnormalities in either the retina or the inner ear. The Pcdh15-null mice showed very high levels of spontaneous motor activity which was too disturbed to perform standard behavioral testing. However, the Pcdh15 heterozygous deletion mice (Pcdh15-het) exhibited enhanced spontaneous locomotor activity, reduced prepulse inhibition, and diminished cliff avoidance behavior. These observations agreed with the symptoms observed in patients with various psychiatric disorders and several mouse models of psychiatric diseases. Specifically, the hyperactivity may mirror the manic episodes in BD. To obtain a more physiological, long-term quantification of the hyperactive phenotype, we implanted nano tag® sensor chips in the animals, to enable the continuous monitoring of both activity and body temperature. During the light-off period, Pcdh15-null exhibited elevated activity and body temperature compared with wild-type (WT) mice. However, we observed a decreased body temperature during the light-on period. Comprehensive brain activity was visualized using c-Fos mapping, which was assessed during the activity and temperature peak and trough. There was a stark contrast between the distribution of c-Fos expression in Pcdh15-null and WT brains during both the light-on and light-off periods. These results provide valuable insights into the neural basis of the behavioral and thermal characteristics of Pcdh15-deletion mice. Therefore, Pcdh15-deletion mice can be a novel model for BD with mania and other psychiatric disorders, with a strong genetic component that satisfies both construct and surface validity.","Daisuke Mori, Chihiro Inami, Ryosuke Ikeda, Masahito Sawahata, Shinji Urata, Sho T Yamaguchi, Yohei Kobayashi, Kosuke Fujita, Yuko Arioka, Hiroki Okumura, Itaru Kushima, Akiko Kodama, Toshiaki Suzuki, Takashi Hirao, Akira Yoshimi, Akira Sobue, Takahiro Ito, Yukikiro Noda, Hiroyuki Mizoguchi, Taku Nagai, Kozo Kaibuchi, Shigeo Okabe, Koji Nishiguchi, Kazuhiko Kume, Kiyofumi Yamada, Norio Ozaki",2024
