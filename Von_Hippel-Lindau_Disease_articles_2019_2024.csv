Spinal cord hemangioblastomas in von Hippel-Lindau disease.,von Hippel-Lindau disease (VHL) is an autosomal dominant familial neoplasia syndrome. The most common manifestation of VHL is central nervous system hemangioblastomas. VHL patients will often develop multiple hemangioblastomas along their craniospinal axis over their lifetime. Spinal cord hemangioblastomas account for nearly half of all nervous system hemangioblastomas in VHL.,"Daniel C Kreatsoulas, Russell R Lonser",2024
Current views on the role of HIF-2α in the pathogenesis and syndromic presentation of pheochromocytoma and paraganglioma.,"Pathogenic variants (PVs) in EPAS1, which encodes hypoxia-inducible factor-2α (HIF-2α), could be the underlying genetic cause of about 3%-6% of pheochromocytoma and paragangliomas (PPGLs). EPAS1-related PPGLs may occur as isolated tumors or as part of Pacak-Zhuang Syndrome (PZS) with two or more of a triad of PPGL, polycythemia, and somatostatinoma. HIF-2α plays a critical role in the regulation of the cellular hypoxia pathway. When a gain-of-function PV is acquired, HIF-2α evades steady-state hydroxylation by the prolyl hydroxylase type 2 (PHD2), which accelerates von Hippel-Lindau (VHL)-mediated proteasomal degradation. In this situation, HIF-2α is stabilized and can translocate to the nucleus, inducing the expression of several genes involved in tumorigenesis. This leads to the development of PPGL and other manifestations of PZS. EPAS1-related PPGLs usually occur in the second or third decade of life, more frequently in females, and are usually multiple, adrenal and extra-adrenal, and norepinephrine-secreting. In addition, these tumors carry an increased metastatic potential and have been reported with metastatic disease in up to 30% of cases. While polycythemia is fairly common in PZS, somatostatinomas are rare. It has been suggested that the character of the acquired PV in EPAS1, which affects its binding to PHD2, correlates with certain phenotypes in PZS. PVs in EPAS1 that have been found in related sporadic PPGLs have also been associated with hypoxic conditions including cyanotic congenital heart disease, hemoglobinopathies and high altitude. Understanding the hypoxia pathway and its role in the pathogenesis of PPGL may open a new avenue for developing effective therapies for these tumors. Indeed, one of these therapies is Belzutifan, a HIF-2α inhibitor that is being tested in the treatment of metastatic PPGLs.","Nicole Bechmann, Jared S Rosenblum, Ali S Alzahrani",2024
Comparative analysis of stereotactic radiosurgery outcomes for supratentorial hemangioblastomas in von hippel-lindau disease and sporadic cases: A multi-center international study.,"Hemangioblastomas (HBs) are rare, benign central nervous system (CNS) neoplasms that rarely occur in the supratentorial. Resection with the goal of gross total resection (GTR) is often considered the primary treatment. Stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) has been utilized more commonly in unresectable or partially resected cases. In this study, we aimed to evaluate SRS's effectiveness and clinical outcomes in supratentorial HBs.","Salem M Tos, Bardia Hajikarimloo, Georgios Mantziaris, Ahmed Shaaban, Duy Pham, Sam Dayawansa, Zhishuo Wei, Lindsay M McKendrick, Ajay Niranjan, L Dade Lunsford, Selcuk Peker, Yavuz Samanci, Roman Liscak, Jaromir May, David Mathieu, Piero Picozzi, Andrea Franzini, Ronald E Warnick, Jonathan E Schoenhals, Joshua D Palmer, Zhiyuan Xu, Jason P Sheehan",2024
Multisystem diseases in the abdomen and pelvis: imaging manifestations and diagnostic roles of cross-sectional imaging.,"Systemic diseases, such as IgG4-related disease, sarcoidosis, and amyloidosis, usually involve multiple systems or organs simultaneously or sequentially. The gastrointestinal tract, hepatobiliary system, and genitourinary tract are commonly involved in many multisystem diseases and can also be the first sites with disease involvement. Cross-sectional imaging, such as CT and MR, plays an important role in the diagnosis and management of multisystem diseases by aiding in the evaluation of multiorgan involvement. Here, common imaging features of frequently affected organs are reviewed in multisystem diseases that we often encounter in the abdomen and pelvis, and the diagnostic roles of cross-sectional imaging for these diseases are also discussed.","Mi Hye Yu, Young Jun Kim, Sungeun Park, Hee Sun Park, Sung Il Jung",2024
Follow-up report on pulmonary mucosa-associated lymphoma in a patient with von Hippel-Lindau disease.,"With the increasing opportunities for medical management of von Hippel-Lindau (VHL)-related lesions, fundamental questions are arising regarding the possibilities of the FDA-approved medication (Belzutifan) to delay the progression of other non-VHL-related tumors that are not requiring urgent surgical interventions. We present a follow-up report on a VHL patient, with a co-morbid history of pulmonary mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue lymphoma, who was initially described in the clinical scientific literature ~10 years ago. This patient's case highlights some of the challenges for some VHL patients with comorbid non-VHL-related tumors and potential opportunities for targeted support.","Bukola A Olarewaju, Judy B Tejon, Mayowa A Osundiji",2024
Genotype-phenotype correlation of ocular von Hippel-Lindau disease in Koreans.,"This scientific report aims to investigate the genotype-phenotype correlations of retinal hemangioblastoma (RH) in von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) disease. The study included 77 patients with genetically confirmed VHL disease who visited an ophthalmology clinic for the evaluation of RH. The presence, location, and size of RH were evaluated, Patients were categorized into three groups based on variants: HIF-1α binding site missense (HM), non-HIF-1α binding site missense (nHM), and truncating (TR) mutations. Fifty-six patients (72.7%) had RH in either eye, and 24 had bilateral RH. Sixteen patients (20.8%) had juxtapapillary RH in either eye. Nine patients had RH ≥ 2.0 disc diameters in size. VHL c.208G>A variant was the most frequent single mutation. Compared with patients having nHM mutations (15 patients) in VHL gene, patients with HM mutations (33 patients) or TR mutations (26 patients) presented a greater number of eyes affected (p = 0.007 and 0.004, respectively), a greater number of RH (p = 0.012 and 0.003, respectively), and more frequent presentation of large RH ≥ 2.0 disc diameters (p = 0.012, and 0.013, respectively). In conclusion, this study provides a deeper understanding of the genetic spectrum of VHL disease in Korean VHL disease and highlights the importance of the location of missense mutations regarding the risk of RH.","Sungsoon Hwang, Se Woong Kang, Jong-Won Kim, Sang Jin Kim",2024
Familial and early recurrent pheochromocytoma in a child with a novel in-frame duplication variant of <i>VHL</i>.,"Pheochromocytomas and paragangliomas (PPGLs) are rare neuroendocrine tumors often linked to underlying genetic variants. Genetic analysis can promote gene-adjusted, specific follow-up, and surveillance protocols for both patients and their families at risk. We report the case of a 7-yr-old boy with bilateral pheochromocytoma, which recurred a year after partial adrenalectomy. The patient's father developed bilateral pheochromocytomas at 25 yr of age. Both individuals possessed a novel heterogeneous in-frame duplication germline variant of <i>VHL</i>, yet neither exhibited other clinical manifestations of von Hippel-Lindau disease (VHL). Traditionally, <i>VHL</i> missense mutations have been associated with a higher risk of PPGL development, whereas truncating mutations typically confer a lower risk. In-frame duplication variants are rarely observed in patients with VHL but may lead to changes in the three-dimensional structure of the translated protein, similar to truncating variants. Our analysis suggests that these in-frame duplications of amino acids in specific regions may cause pheochromocytomas in a manner similar to missense variants. Further accumulation of VHL cases with various genotypes and standardized open-access worldwide databases, including longitudinal and specific clinical data linked to genotypes, is required. It is crucial to consider genetic analyses for pediatricians who may diagnose childhood-onset PPGL.","Yuri Suzuki, Ryosei Iemura, Akito Sutani, Yuki Mizuno, Eriko Adachi, Mineko Ushiama, Teruhiko Yoshida, Makoto Hirata, Akihiro Hoshino, Kurara Yamomoto, Takumi Akashi, Yoshiko Nakano, Takeshi Isoda, Kei Takasawa, Motohiro Kato, Masatoshi Takagi, Kentaro Okamoto, Tomohiro Morio, Kenichi Kashimada",2024

A novel pathogenic germline chromosome 3 inversion in von Hippel-Lindau disease.,"von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) is an autosomal-dominant hereditary tumour susceptibility disease associated with pathogenic germline variants in the <i>VHL</i> tumour suppressor gene. VHL patients are at increased risk of developing multiple benign and malignant tumours. Current CLIA-based genetic tests demonstrate a very high detection rate of germline <i>VHL</i> variants in patients with clinical manifestations of VHL. In this report, we describe a large family with canonical VHL manifestations, for which no germline alteration had been detected by conventional germline testing. We identified a novel 291 kb chromosomal inversion involving chromosome 3p in affected family members. This inversion disrupts the <i>VHL</i> gene between exon 2 and exon 3 and is thereby responsible for the disease observed in this family.","Cathy D Vocke, Christopher J Ricketts, Svetlana Pack, Mark Raffeld, Stephen Hewitt, Alexandra P Lebensohn, Lidenys O'Brien, Rabindra Gautam, Krista Reynolds, Laura S Schmidt, Kristin Choo, Alex Kenigsberg, Sandeep Gurram, Emily Y Chew, Naris Nilubol, Prashant Chittaboina, Maria J Merino, Mark W Ball, W Marston Linehan",2024
Hereditary Pheochromocytoma as a Main Manifestation of von Hippel Lindau Disease (vHL) in Childhood - A Long-term Follow-up of 5 Patients with vHL from One Family.,"Von Hippel-Lindau disease (vHL) is a hereditary, autosomal dominant syndrome manifested by a predisposition to the occurrence of benign and malignant neoplasms. The spectrum of vHL-related neoplasms includes: pheochromocytoma (PHEO), central nervous system and retinal hemangioblastomas, renal clear cell carcinoma, epididymal cystadenomas, pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors as well as visceral (renal and pancreatic) cysts. We report the family (5 patients) with genetically confirmed vHL in which every member had PHEO diagnosed during pediatric care. The presented family had a missense variant in the <i>VHL</i> gene (ex1 g.A451G gene, p. S80G) which is connected with an increased risk of PHEO. Performing screening laboratory and imaging tests in patients with genetically confirmed vHL disease can help to avoid the occurrence of disease symptoms and to perform an elective surgery in safe conditions. Due to the risk of coexisting pathologies and the complexity of the disease, patients with vHL require long-term care.","Katarzyna Pasternak-Pietrzak, Agata Kozłowska, Elżbieta Moszczyńska",2024

Advances in Molecular Mechanisms of Kidney Disease: Integrating Renal Tumorigenesis of Hereditary Cancer Syndrome.,"Renal cell carcinoma (RCC) comprises various histologically distinct subtypes, each characterized by specific genetic alterations, necessitating individualized management and treatment strategies for each subtype. An exhaustive search of the PubMed database was conducted without any filters or restrictions. Inclusion criteria encompassed original English articles focusing on molecular mechanisms of kidney cancer. On the other hand, all non-original articles and articles published in any language other than English were excluded. Hereditary kidney cancer represents 5-8% of all kidney cancer cases and is associated with syndromes such as von Hippel-Lindau syndrome, Birt-Hogg-Dubè syndrome, succinate dehydrogenase-deficient renal cell cancer syndrome, tuberous sclerosis complex, hereditary papillary renal cell carcinoma, fumarate hydratase deficiency syndrome, BAP1 tumor predisposition syndrome, and other uncommon hereditary cancer syndromes. These conditions are characterized by distinct genetic mutations and related extra-renal symptoms. The majority of renal cell carcinoma predispositions stem from loss-of-function mutations in tumor suppressor genes. These mutations promote malignant advancement through the somatic inactivation of the remaining allele. This review aims to elucidate the main molecular mechanisms underlying the pathophysiology of major syndromes associated with renal cell carcinoma. By providing a comprehensive overview, it aims to facilitate early diagnosis and to highlight the principal therapeutic options available.","Rossella Cicchetti, Martina Basconi, Giulio Litterio, Marco Mascitti, Flavia Tamborino, Angelo Orsini, Alessio Digiacomo, Matteo Ferro, Luigi Schips, Michele Marchioni",2024
Unusual Presentation of Von Hippel-Lindau Syndrome With Gastric Variceal Bleeding.,Gastric varices are most commonly a complication of portal hypertension or splenic vein thrombosis (SVT). The presence of gastric varices due to portal hypertension is significantly less than the prevalence of esophageal varices. SVT is a known complication of pancreatitis due to inflammation or compression of the splenic vein coursing along the posterior surface of the pancreas. Occlusion of the splenic vein leads to left-sided portal hypertension. Left-sided portal hypertension results in the development of collateral vessels that bypass the splenic vein by connecting with the short gastric veins. The associated increased pressure within the gastric vessels results in gastric varices. Gastric varices due to SVT may occur in the absence of or be disproportionate to esophageal varices. We report an interesting case of gastrointestinal bleeding from gastric varices related to cirrhosis secondary to metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis and SVT secondary to chronic pancreatitis due to pancreatic neuroendocrine tumor (NET) in a patient diagnosed with von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) syndrome.,"David W Graham, Blake Thompson, Parvez Mantry",2024

Contrast-enhanced CT on day 2 post-CRA revealed a thrombus in the portal vein of segment 6 near the ablated liver parenchyma, prompting the initiation of oral anticoagulation. The patient was discharged on day 4 after CRA without any sequelae, and a follow-up contrast-enhanced CT done 6 weeks later demonstrated resolution of the portal vein thrombus.","Takahiro Kawabata, Toshihiro Iguchi, Yusuke Matsui, Koji Tomita, Mayu Uka, Noriyuki Umakoshi, Takao Hiraki",2024
Single Stage Bilateral Adrenalectomy (Cortical-Sparing) and Pancreatectomy (Corpus-Sparing) in a Patient with Von Hippel-Lindau Disease.,"Von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) disease is an autosomal dominant syndrome and affects many organs. We aim to report an adult patient with VHL disease having bilateral adrenal pheochromocytoma and multiple neuroendocrine tumors of the pancreas who was successfully treated with simultaneous function-preserving adrenalectomy and pancreatectomy. A 27-year-old woman was admitted to hospital with hypertension. The computed tomography of the abdomen revealed a solid tumor in both adrenal glands with the sizes of 12x7 cm on the right and 4x4 cm on the left. She also had two pancreatic solid masses in the head and three in the tail with varying sizes. The laboratory tests are all within normal limits except elevated 24-hour urinary metanephrine and normetanephrine. I-123 MIBG scanning showed increased uptake in both adrenal glands. Fine needle aspiration biopsy of the tumor on head of pancreas via endoscopic ultrasonography showed neuroendocrine tumor. Those findings were compatible with bilateral pheochromocytoma and multiple pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors and genetic tests revealed the mutation which confirmed the diagnosis of VHL disease. After suppression with alpha-1 inhibitor, right total, left cortical-sparing adrenalectomy, Whipple procedure for the pancreatic head lesions and spleen-preserving distal pancreatectomy were performed and pancreatic corpus was preserved. This case showed that multiple function-preserving procedures can be safely performed with oncological principles in patients with VHL disease.","Mehmet Haciyanli, Turan Acar, Oguzhan Ozsay, Nihan Acar, Selda Gucek Haciyanli, Emine Ozlem Gur, Osman Nuri Dilek",2024

von Hippel-Lindau Syndrome and Secondary Hypertension: A Case Report.,"von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) syndrome (OMIM #193300) is an autosomal dominant disorder with incomplete penetrance occurring due to a mutation in the <i>VHL</i> gene present on chromosome 3. We present the case of a 21-year-old male with a history of retinoblastoma presenting with intermittent headaches for one month. He was a known hypertensive and his blood pressure on presentation was 180/100 mmHg. A secondary cause for his hypertension was sought. Multiple cysts in his pancreas, both his kidneys, and a mass in the right suprarenal fossa were detected on an abdominal ultrasonogram and a subsequent computed tomography scan of the abdomen. VHL and a pheochromocytoma were suspected, and a positron emission tomography-computed tomography scan was done which collaborated with the above findings. The presence of multiple cystic lesions in the pancreas and kidneys, especially in an individual with a family history of VHL syndrome, should alert the physician to the possibility of VHL syndrome. The need for evaluation of causes for hypertension, especially in young individuals with resistant hypertension, is also highlighted.","Sharan Bose, Kandasamy Venkataraju Rajalakshmi, Ananthakumar Perumal Kumaresan, Jibin Simon",2024

Technical Considerations for the Surgical Management of a C2 Spinal Cord Hemangioblastoma and Subjacent Cervical Spondylotic Myelopathy: A 2-Dimensional Operative Video.,"Hemangioblastomas are characterized as benign tumors of the central nervous system and are typically associated with von Hippel-Lindau disease in 20% to 30% of patients.1 Spinal hemangioblastomas are rare entities accounting for 2.1% of spinal cord tumors and are most frequently observed in the cervical spinal region.1-4 Treatment interventions include microsurgical resection and stereotactic radiosurgery.5 Understanding the granular detail of surgical management in these complex cases is necessary for optimal clinical outcomes. In this 2-dimensional operative video, we detail the technical nuances for resection of a World Health Organization Grade I hemangioblastoma in the upper cervical spine of a 51-year-old man. The lesion and severe adjacent canal stenosis resulted in extensive spinal cord compression, causing him to experience progressive myelopathic symptoms and neurological deficits. A C1-C7 laminectomy provided exposure of the hemangioblastoma and adequate decompression of the subjacent spondylotic disease. Intraoperative ultrasound was used to localize the tumor and perform a targeted durotomy. The sunburst-colored lesion was eccentric to the left side of C1-C2 and found in the epi-pial region, with pial thickening present in the surrounding area. The feeding vessels and deep draining vein were coagulated and cut. Low-power suction was used for traction/counter-traction dissection of the tumor planes. Owing to a multilevel laminectomy having been performed, hardware placement was performed from C2-T1. Adequate placement of all screws was confirmed with intraoperative 3-dimensional image acquisition. The patient provided informed consent for the operation and for sharing his clinical information, including digital media, for publication; Institutional Review Board not required per institutional policy.","Olivia E Gilbert, Mia Cranmer, Michael Galgano",2024
Comprehensive treatment of von Hippel-Lindau disease: A case report.,"von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) disease is a rare autosomal dominant multiorgan disease characterized by several benign and malignant tumors rich in vascular, as well as cysts in other organs. A great clinical treatment strategy is significantly warranted for good prognosis of patients with VHL disease. Herein, we reported a case of a 45-year-old woman diagnosed with VHL disease with spinal hemangioblastoma (HB) and clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC). Four years after the resection of the right kidney, a recurrent RCC in the right kidney and a malignant lesion in the left kidney were observed. This patient was started on sorafenib (800 mg, daily) and tislelizumab (200 mg per 3 weeks). After 6 months of treatment, the size of renal cell carcinoma was dramatically reduced and renal function improved. More importantly, she achieved partial response during the whole treatment. Microscopically, intramedullary masses resection was done and the HB in T4-5 thoracic spinal was removed. Neurologic symptoms such as numbness and pain were remarkably alleviated. Additionally, tislelizumab-induced elevation in liver transaminase levels and hypothyroidism were revered by hepatoprotector and levothyroxine, respectively. In short, comprehensive treatment strategies may benefit patients with VHL disease, especially with HB and ccRCC.","Xuesong Li, Zheng Mo, Zhuo Yu",2024
