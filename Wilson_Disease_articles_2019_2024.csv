"Unusual Confluence: Exploring the Association of Biliary Atresia, Wilson Disease, and Iron Overload.","The case involves a 33-year-old man with biliary atresia, Wilson disease (WD), and iron overload. Biliary atresia, a cholangiodestructive disease, leads to cirrhosis if untreated. WD, caused by ATP7B gene mutations, results in copper accumulation affecting the liver and brain. Iron overload can be seen in cases of WD and with hereditary hemochromatosis gene mutations. The patient's concurrent presentation of these conditions poses a unique clinical challenge. Elevated iron levels may worsen WD outcomes. A detailed history and physical examination, genetic testing, and close follow-up are crucial. The case highlights the need for increased awareness and vigilant monitoring of patients with overlapping liver diseases.","Shivangini Duggal, Samantha Meza-Rodriguez, Saqib Shahid, Marc Zuckerman, Jorge Chiquie Borges",2024
Zinc gluconate for Wilson disease.,"Due to financial constraints, a patient with Wilson disease required transitioning his maintenance pharmacotherapy from zinc acetate to zinc gluconate. Herein, we report the clinical and laboratory outcomes of this switch and review the relevant literature on the treatment of Wilson disease with zinc. Zinc gluconate can be a viable treatment option for patients with Wilson disease and may be associated with fewer gastrointestinal side effects than zinc acetate and, accordingly, improved long-term compliance and improved clinical outcomes.",Mark S LeDoux,2024

"Trientine Tetrahydrochloride, From Bench to Bedside: A Narrative Review.","Trientine tetrahydrochloride (TETA-4HCl, Cuvrior<sup>Â®</sup>) is a copper chelating agent with the active moiety triethylenetetramine (trientine), developed by Orphalan, Inc. to address the unmet needs in the treatment of Wilson disease. The journey from bench to bedside builds upon the documented safety profile of trientine hydrochloride capsules developed initially to meet the needs of individuals intolerant to D-penicillamine (DPA). Trientine hydrochloride capsules are inherently unstable requiring strict cold chain storage conditions from production, transportation, and use at home by the patient. Trientine tetrahydrochloride has a distinctive, patent-protected unique polymorphic form, which permits the production at scale of film-coated scored tablets deemed room temperature stable for 36 months. Trientine tetrahydrochloride is supported by a well-characterized pharmacodynamic, pharmacokinetic, and metabolic profile demonstrating reliable and predictable dose linearity and dose proportionality kinetics. Trientine tetrahydrochloride is the only trientine formulation that has been compared with DPA in a prospective randomized clinical trial, demonstrating non-inferiority to DPA in adults with stable Wilson disease. On 28 April, 2022, the US Food and Drug Administration approved TETA-4HCl for use in adult patients with Wilson disease who are de-coppered and tolerant to DPA. Health authorities in multiple countries worldwide have approved TETA-4HCl for the treatment of adults and children aged 5 years or more who are intolerant to DPA including the European Union, UK, Saudi Arabia, Switzerland, Colombia, Australia, New Zealand, and China. This article aims to provide a comprehensive narrative review of the key milestones in the development of TETA-4HCl.","C Omar F Kamlin, Timothy M Jenkins, Jamie L Heise, Naseem S Amin",2024
Neuroimaging Correlates with Clinical Severity in Wilson Disease: A Multiparametric Quantitative Brain MRI.,"Previous studies have reported metal accumulation and microstructure changes in deep gray nuclei (DGN) in Wilson disease (WD). However, there are limited studies that investigate whether there is metal accumulation and microstructure changes in DGN of patients with WD with normal-appearing routine MRI. This study aimed to evaluate multiparametric changes in DGN of WD and whether the findings correlate with clinical severity in patients with WD.","Xiao-Zhong Jing, Gai-Ying Li, Yu-Peng Wu, Xiang-Zhen Yuan, Jia-Lin Chen, Shu-Hong Wang, Xiao-Ping Wang, Jian-Qi Li",2024
Amantadine-induced psychosis in Wilson disease.,"Wilson disease is a rare genetic disorder of copper metabolism causing hepatic dysfunction and neuro-psychiatric manifestations. While psychosis in Wilson disease is uncommon, it can occur, especially with certain medications. We describe a 40-year-old woman diagnosed with Wilson disease who developed psychotic symptoms following the initiation and dose escalation of amantadine, a drug commonly used to treat parkinsonism associated with the disorder. Her symptoms included delusions of persecution, irritability and anomalous self-experiences such as 'made' phenomena, which are typically seen in schizophrenia. The psychosis resolved after discontinuing amantadine, without worsening her neurological symptoms. This underscores the importance of monitoring for psychiatric side-effects, particularly Schneiderian first-rank symptoms, in patients with Wilson disease being treated with amantadine. The findings suggest a probable adverse drug reaction, highlighting the need for careful evaluation and dose adjustments in such complex clinical cases.","Satish Suhas, Gaurav Kumar Singh, Vanteemar S Sreeraj, Ganesan Venkatasubramanian",2024
Dysfunction of ATP7B splicing variant caused by enhanced interaction with COMMD1 in Wilson Disease.,"The association between Wilson disease and various ATP7B mutations is well-established; however, the molecular mechanism underlying the functional consequence of these mutations, particularly the splicing mutations, remains unclear. This study focused on the ATP7B c.1543+1G>C variant, to reveal a universal pathogenic mechanism of the ATP7B mutants with altered N-terminus.","Donghu Zhou, Huaduan Zi, Xiaoxi Yang, Xiaojin Li, Yanmeng Li, Anjian Xu, Bei Zhang, Wei Zhang, Xiaojuan Ou, Jidong Jia, Jian Huang, Hong You",2024
Validation of Metallothionein Immunohistochemistry as a Highly Sensitive Screening Test for Wilson Disease.,"Wilson's disease (WD) is a rare autosomal recessive condition with protean clinical manifestations that results from biallelic ATP7B mutations. However, non-destructive tissue tests to be applied clinically to tissue specimens are not widely available to effectively assess patients for possible WD. Previously, we showed that metallothionein (MTH) immunohistochemistry has a high sensitivity and specificity for WD diagnosis and, thus, represents a potentially powerful diagnostic tool that can be used in routine histologic sections. We sought to validate this finding in a large cohort of bona fide WD patients and to correlate metallothionein expression with other histologic features. We identified 91 cases of WD, which included 28 needle biopsies and 64 explants from 14 centers worldwide. Histologic features were evaluated, and a histopathological pattern was assigned to each case. All cases were evaluated with Masson trichrome and MTH immunohistochemistry (clone UC1MT, Abcam) using previously published technique. Liver tissues from chronic cholestatic diseases (n= 42) were used as controls. The median age of the cohort was 28.5 years. Out of 91 total cases, 83 were positive for MTH immunostain. In the controls, all 42 cases were negative for MTH immunostain. The sensitivity and specificity of MTH immunostain for WD were 91.20% and 100%, respectively. MTH immunohistochemistry is a highly sensitive and specific cost-effective screening tool for WD. It can be used for patients across age groups, varied histologic patterns, and fibrosis stages. This marker could prove to be a valuable tool in the evaluation of patients with possible WD.","Nadarra L Stokes, Ameya Patil, Oyedele Adeyi, Amarpreet Bhalla, Ian Brown, Kathleen Byrnes, Julien Calderaro, Diane Chen, Wei Chen, Caroline Cooper, Deepti Dhall, Wendy Frankel, Gretchen Galliano Gooch, Raul S Gonzalez, Suntrea Hammer, Gillian Hale, Stephen Lagana, Catriona McKenzie, Daniela S Allende, Roger K Moreira, Raouf Nakhleh, ILKe Nalbantoglu, Rish K Pai, Marcela Salomao, David F Schaeffer, Angela Shih, Joo-Shik Shin, Camila C Simoes, Mukul Vij, Mohamed Rela, Yue Xue, Rhonda K Yantiss, Bassel Zein Sabatto, Rondell P Graham",2024
Structural lesions and transcriptomic specializations shape gradient perturbations in Wilson disease.,"Functional dysregulations in multiple regions are caused by excessive copper deposition in the brain in Wilson disease (WD) patients. The genetic mechanism of WD is thought to involve the abnormal expression of <i>ATP7B</i> in the liver, whereas the biological and molecular processes involved in functional dysregulation within the brain remain unexplored. The objective of this study was to unravel the underpinnings of functional gradient perturbations underlying structural lesions and transcriptomic specializations in WD. In this study, we included 105 WD patients and 93 healthy controls who underwent structural and functional MRI assessments. We used the diffusion mapping embedding model to derive the functional connectome gradient and further employed gray matter volume to uncover structure-function decoupling for WD. Then, we used Neurosynth, clinical data, and whole-brain gene expression data to examine the meta-analytic cognitive function, clinical phenotypes, and transcriptomic specializations related to WD gradient alterations. Compared with controls, WD patients exhibited global topographic changes in the principal pramary-to-transmodal gradient. Meta-analytic terms and clinical characteristics were correlated with these gradient alterations in motor-related processing, higher-order cognition, neurological symptoms, and age. Spatial correlations revealed structure-function decoupling in multiple networks, especially in subcortical and visual networks. Within the cortex, the spatial association between gradient alterations and gene expression profiles has revealed transcriptomic specilizations in WD that display properties indicative of ion homeostasis, neural development, and motor control. Furthermore, for the first time, we characterized the role of the <i>ATP7B</i> gene in impacting subcortical function. The transcriptomic specializations of WD were also associated with other neurological and psychiatric disorders. Finally, we revealed that structural lesions and gradient perturbations may share similar transcriptomic specializations in WD. In conclusion, these findings bridged functional gradient perturbations to structural lesions and gene expression profiles in WD patients, possibly promoting our understanding of the neurobiological mechanisms underlying the emergence of complex neurological and psychiatric phenotypes.","Sheng Hu, Chuanfu Li, Yanming Wang, Taohua Wei, Xiaoxiao Wang, Ting Dong, Yulong Yang, Yufeng Ding, Bensheng Qiu, Wenming Yang",2024
Exchangeable serum copper: Adult and pediatric reference intervals and in vitro stability in a nordic cohort.,"Wilson disease (WD) is a rare genetic disorder characterized by copper overload, primarily affecting the liver and brain, and the organ damage is believed to be caused by non-ceruloplasmin-bound copper (NCC). Accurate and early diagnosis is important for prognosis. Recently, a method for the measurement of NCC, exchangeable serum copper (CuEXC), was developed and shown to be a promising marker of WD, especially as the fraction of total copper, relative exchangeable copper (REC). This study aimed to validate the CuEXC extraction method and establish reference intervals for CuEXC and REC, as well as to examine short- and long-term stability of CuEXC in serum samples. The adult reference interval for CuEXC was 0.61-1.62Â Âµmol/L and for REC 3.0-9.7Â % based on 120 blood donors. Based on 88 children, the reference intervals for CuEXC was 0.45-1.16Â Âµmol/L. The intervals for REC were 1.8-5.8Â % for childrenÂ <10Â years and 2.3-8.5Â % for childrenÂ â¥10Â years. Regarding stability, CuEXC increased following a logarithmic scale in uncentrifuged serum and exceeded the permissible difference of 10Â % after 4Â h. With long-term freezing at -20Â Â°C, CuEXC was stable for 1.7Â months. In conclusion, reference intervals for CuEXC and REC were established and confirmed to be substantially lower in children. Accurate reference intervals are important to ensure timely diagnosis of WD. Finally, our findings on stability have important implications and highlight the need for standardization of the pre-analytical handling of CuEXC samples in order to obtain comparable results within and between laboratories both for clinical and research use.","Silje Hovden Christensen, Frederik Teicher Kirk, Tua Gyldenholm, Emilie Munk, Britta Eilersen Hjerrild, Helene Kvistgaard, Lene Damm Christensen, Thomas Damgaard Sandahl, Anders Abildgaard",2024
A Qualitative Study Exploring Experiences in Caregiving for Patients With Advanced Wilson Disease.,"BACKGROUND: Wilson disease (WD) is a rare disease characterized by impaired copper metabolism. It is usually diagnosed in children and has several distinct attributes that can make the caregiving experience different. The advanced stage of the illness is quite challenging, and caregiver experiences during this phase of the disease are underexplored. METHODS: The present study is an exploratory qualitative investigation with in-depth interviews aiming to understand the experiences of family caregivers of children with advanced WD receiving neuropalliative care services at a tertiary care hospital. Interviews from 7 family caregivers were recorded, transcribed, and analyzed using an inductive and interpretive approach. RESULTS: Family caregivers in the study were predominantly mothers. The major themes that emerged are: being a parent and the caregiver, uncertainty related to illness, financial implications, understanding the disease dynamics, constructive coping strategies, and extended family networks and societal influences. CONCLUSION: The experiences and the encounters of family caregivers of children with advanced WD are multifaceted. Their challenging experiences underscore the need for extended supportive services and neuropalliative nursing care to assist the caregivers and families, and navigate the process of treatment and rehabilitation for the child.","Priya Baby, Priya Treesa Thomas, Binesha P, Jobimol J, Gargi S Kumar, Arun M, Nitish Kamble, Ravi Yadav, Pramod K Pal",2024
Generation of an induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) line (IGIBi026-A) derived from Wilson disease patient harboring compound heterozygous mutations [c.2165dupT (p.R723Efs31) and c.C813A (p.C271*)] in the ATP7B gene.,"Wilson disease (WD) is a rare autosomal recessive disease caused due to mutations in the ATP7B gene.

Exchangeable copper for patients with Wilson disease at follow-up: Rethinking normal ranges or changing methodology.,"Determining suitable copper parameters for monitoring Wilson disease remains a topic of ongoing discussion. International recommendations currently rely on the combination of urinary copper excretion and nonspecific liver markers when considering therapy and time elapsed since diagnosis. The emergence of exchangeable copper (CuEX) as a novel measurement reflecting the ""free copper pool"" held promise as a valuable target to ensure metabolic stability during follow-up, although the validation of target ranges remains unknown. We aimed to evaluate CuEX quantification in repeated samples from 92 real-world patients with Wilson disease during a 2-year period.","Zoe MariÃ±o, ClÃ udia GarcÃ­a-SolÃ , JosÃ© RÃ­os, Ariadna Bono, Sonia GarcÃ­a, Anna Miralpeix, RocÃ­o Andreu, Cristina Aguado, Xavier Forns, MercÃ¨ Torra, Marina Berenguer",2024
Progressive familial intrahepatic cholestasis 3 Camouflaging as Wilson disease in a 12-year-old: a diagnostic Odyssey.,"Primary Familial Intrahepatic Cholestasis type 3 is an exceedingly rare genetic cholestatic disorder characterized by the defective hepatocanaliculr bile acid transport leading to progressive liver disease. In this case report, we describe the course of treatment for a 12-year-old kid diagnosed with Wilson disease based on Leipzig score and copper investigations. The child did not improve with chelation therapy and was subsequently genetically classified as PFIC-3. This case highlighted the caveats in Wilson disease diagnostic scoring system. The diagnostic odyssey, therapeutic interventions, and outcome of this case underscore the intricate interplay between clinical suspicion, investigative strategies, and the pivotal role of genetic testing to elucidate rare liver disorders in children.","Kalpana Panda, Subhasis Pradhan, Mrutunjay Dash, Girish Kumar Pati",2024

Investigating common mutations in ATP7B gene and the prevalence of Wilson's disease in the Thai population using population-based genome-wide datasets.,"Wilson's disease (WD) is a rare metabolic disorder caused by variations in the ATP7B gene. It usually manifests hepatic, neurologic, and psychiatric symptoms due to excessive copper accumulation. The prevalence of WD and its common variants differ across populations. This study aimed to examine these aspects of WD within the Thai population, where information has been limited. We reviewed ClinVar and the Wilson Disease Mutation Database, organizing variants classified as pathogenic or likely pathogenic in one or both databases as ""relaxed"" and ""strict"" lists. Allele frequencies were estimated from genotyping array data (Asian Screening Array: ASA; Illumina Corp, CA) of 6291 Thai subjects, which also underwent genotype imputation. The prevalence of WD in the Thai population was estimated assuming Hardy-Weinberg Equilibrium. The strict list yielded a prevalence of 1/24,128 (carrier frequency=1/78), while the relaxed list yielded a prevalence of 1/9971 (carrier frequency=1/50). The most common WD variants in Thai subjects were c.2333âGâ>âT, c.3443âTâ>âC, and c.813âCâ>âA from the strict list, and c.3316âGâ>âA and c.2605âGâ>âA from the relaxed list. The ASA chip covered approximately 59 and 24% of WD variants from the strict and relaxed lists, respectively. Based on the estimated prevalence, a carrier screening program for WD is not currently required in Thailand. However, as genotyping services become more affordable and accessible, such a program would facilitate early identification, treatment, and prevention of WD.","Paravee Own-Eium, Donniphat Dejsuphong, Prin Vathesatogkit, Piyamitr Sritara, Thanyachai Sura, Wichai Aekplakorn, Bhoom Suktitipat, Jakris Eu-Ahsunthornwattana",2024

MAMMALIAN COPPER HOMEOSTASIS: PHYSIOLOGIC ROLES AND MOLECULAR MECHANISMS.,"In the past decade, evidence for numerous roles of copper (Cu) in mammalian physiology has grown exponentially. The discoveries of Cu involvement in cell signaling, autophagy, cell motility, differentiation, and regulated cell death (cuproptosis) have markedly extended the list of already known functions of Cu, such as a cofactor of essential metabolic enzymes, a protein structural component, and a regulator of protein trafficking. Novel and unexpected functions of Cu transporting proteins and enzymes have been identified, and new disorders of Cu homeostasis have been described. Significant progress has been made in the mechanistic studies of two classic disorders of Cu metabolism, Menkes disease and Wilson disease, which paved ways to novel approaches to their treatment. Discovery of cuproptosis and the role of Cu in cells metastatic growth have markedly increased interest in targeting Cu homeostatic pathways to treat cancer. In this review, we summarize the established concepts in the field of mammalian Cu physiology, and discuss how new discoveries of the past decade expand and modify these concepts. The roles of Cu in brain metabolism, in cells' functional speciation and a recently discovered regulated cell death have attracted significant attention and are highlighted in this review.","Svetlana Lutsenko, Shubhrajit Roy, Peter Tsvetkov",2024
