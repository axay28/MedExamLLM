A case of X-Linked adrenoleukodystrophy caused by a novel mutation with singular clinical manifestation: unilateral lower limb weakness.,"X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy (X-ALD) is caused by mutations in the ABCD1 gene, leading to the accumulation of very long-chain fatty acids (VLCFAs) in plasma and tissues. It primarily affects the central nervous system white matter and the adrenal cortex. Clinical manifestations include myeloneuropathy, leukodystrophy, and adrenal insufficiency. Reliable methods for diagnosis include VLCFAs and genetic testing. We report the case of a 31-year-old male X-ALD patient who mainly presented with unilateral lower limb weakness. Adrenal insufficiency was not observed, and there was no evidence of peripheral nerve involvement in nerve conduction studies. MRI revealed only mild atrophy of thoracic spinal cord without other relevant abnormalities. Ultimately, Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS) and VLCFAs testing confirmed the diagnosis of X-ALD, and the NGS indicated a novel missense mutation.","Geke Zhu, Han Zhou, Yongbo Ma, Rui Liu, Xiangtao Nie, Wenjing Qi, Lei Hao, Xiuming Guo",2024
A case of adrenomyeloneuropathy caused by a novel point mutation in the <i>ABCD1</i> gene and functional verification.,"Adrenoleukodystrophy is a rare neurogenetic disease, and adrenomyeloneuropathy is the most common phenotype in adults. The clinical data of a patient with adrenoleukodystrophy and spinal-peripheral neuropathy caused by a novel point mutation in exon 4 of the <i>ABCD1</i> gene (c.1256T > G (p.Val419Gly)) were retrospectively analyzed. Furthermore, we constructed wild-type and mutant vectors of the <i>ABCD1</i> (NM0000334) gene to validate the effect of this mutation on the expression of the <i>ABCD1</i> gene and protein and to explore the mechanism of X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy occurrence and development to identify therapeutic targets for clinical treatment.","Xiaoxue Shi, Xuelin Qi, Jinhua Zheng, Jianjun Ma, Dongsheng Li",2024
Genetic analysis of the X-linked Adrenoleukodystrophy <i>ABCD1 gene</i> in <i>Drosophila</i> uncovers a role in Peroxisomal dynamics.,"X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy (X-ALD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder caused by a loss-of-function (LOF) mutation in the <i>ATP-binding cassette subfamily D member 1</i> (<i>ABCD1)</i> gene, leading to the accumulation of very long-chain fatty acids (VLCFAs). This disorder exhibits striking heterogeneity; some male patients develop an early childhood neuroinflammatory demyelination disorder, while other patients, including adult males and most affected female carriers, experience a chronic progressive myelopathy. Adrenocortical failure is observed in almost all male patients, with age of onset varying sometimes being the first diagnostic finding. The gene underlying this spectrum of disease encodes an ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter that localizes to peroxisomes and facilitates VLCFA transport. X-ALD is considered a single peroxisomal component defect and does not play a direct role in peroxisome assembly. <i>Drosophila</i> models of other peroxisomal genes have provided mechanistic insight into some of the neurodegenerative mechanisms with reduced lifespan, retinal degeneration, and VLCFA accumulation. Here, we perform a genetic analysis of the fly ABCD1 ortholog <i>Abcd1</i> (CG2316). Knockdown or deficiency of <i>Abcd1</i> leads to VLCFA accumulation, salivary gland defects, locomotor impairment and retinal lipid abnormalities. Interestingly, there is also evidence of reduced peroxisomal numbers. Flies overexpressing the human cDNA for <i>ABCD1</i> display a wing crumpling phenotype characteristic of the <i>pex2</i> loss-of-function. Surprisingly, overexpression of human <i>ABCD1</i> appears to inhibit or overwhelm peroxisomal biogenesis to levels similar to null mutations in fly <i>pex2</i>, <i>pex16</i> and <i>pex3</i>. <i>Drosophila Abcd1</i> is therefore implicated in peroxisomal number, and overexpression of the human <i>ABCD1</i> gene acts a potent inhibitor of peroxisomal biogenesis in flies.","Joshua Manor, Sharayu V Jangam, Hyung-Lok Chung, Pranjali Bhagwat, Jonathan Andrews, Hillary Chester, Shu Kondo, Saurabh Srivastav, Juan Botas, Ann B Moser, Suzette M Huguenin, Michael F Wangler",2024
Lentiviral Gene Therapy for Cerebral Adrenoleukodystrophy.,"Cerebral adrenoleukodystrophy is a severe form of X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy characterized by white-matter disease, loss of neurologic function, and early death. Elivaldogene autotemcel (eli-cel) gene therapy, which consists of autologous CD34+ cells transduced with Lenti-D lentiviral vector containing <i>ABCD1</i> complementary DNA, is being tested in persons with cerebral adrenoleukodystrophy.","Florian Eichler, Christine N Duncan, Patricia L Musolino, Troy C Lund, Ashish O Gupta, Satiro De Oliveira, Adrian J Thrasher, Patrick Aubourg, Jörn-Sven Kühl, Daniel J Loes, Hernan Amartino, Nicholas Smith, Juliana Folloni Fernandes, Caroline Sevin, Raman Sankar, Shaun A Hussain, Paul Gissen, Jean-Hugues Dalle, Uwe Platzbecker, Gerald F Downey, Elizabeth McNeil, Laura Demopoulos, Andrew C Dietz, Himal L Thakar, Paul J Orchard, David A Williams",2024
Practical Approach to Longitudinal Neurologic Care of Adults With X-Linked Adrenoleukodystrophy and Adrenomyeloneuropathy.,"Although X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy (ALD) has historically been considered a childhood disease managed by pediatric neurologists, it is one of the most common leukodystrophies diagnosed in adulthood. An increase in both male and female adults reaching diagnosis due to familial cases identified by state newborn screening panels and more widespread use of genetic testing results in a large cohort of presymptomatic or early symptomatic adults. This population is in urgent need of standardized assessments and follow-up care. Adults with ALD/adrenomyeloneuropathy (AMN) may be diagnosed in a variety of ways, including after another family member is identified via genetic testing or newborn screening, presenting for symptomatic evaluation, or following diagnosis with primary adrenal insufficiency. Significant provider, patient, and systems-based barriers prevent adult patients with ALD/AMN from receiving appropriate care, including lack of awareness of the importance of longitudinal neurologic management. Confirmation of and education about the diagnosis should be coordinated in conjunction with a genetic counselor. Routine surveillance for adrenal insufficiency and onset of cerebral ALD (CALD) in men should be performed systematically to avoid preventable morbidity and mortality. While women with ALD do not usually develop cerebral demyelination or adrenal insufficiency, they remain at risk for myeloneuropathy and are no longer considered ""carriers."" After diagnosis, patients should be connected to the robust support networks, foundations, and research organizations available for ALD/AMN. Core principles of neurologic symptom management parallel those for patients with other etiologies of progressive spastic paraplegia. Appropriate patient candidates for hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) and other investigational disease-modifying strategies require early identification to achieve optimal outcomes. All patients with ALD/AMN, regardless of sex, age, or symptom severity, benefit from a multidisciplinary approach to longitudinal care spearheaded by the neurologist. This review proposes key strategies for diagnostic confirmation, laboratory and imaging surveillance, approach to symptom management, and guidance for identification of appropriate candidates for HSCT and investigational treatments.","Alexandra B Kornbluh, Aaron Baldwin, Ali Fatemi, Adeline Vanderver, Laura A Adang, Keith Van Haren, Jacinda Sampson, Florian S Eichler, Reza Sadjadi, Marc Engelen, Jennifer L Orthmann-Murphy",2024
Peroxisomal leukodystrophy.,"Peroxisomal disorders can be classified as single-enzyme deficiencies or peroxisomal biogenesis disorders (characterized by multiple peroxisomal enzyme deficiencies or complete absence of peroxisomes). Most peroxisomal disorders give rise to complex multisystem disorders. Peroxisomal disorders associated with leukodystrophy are discussed in more detail, specifically X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy, Zellweger spectrum disorders, D-bifunctional protein deficiency, Acyl-CoA oxidase 1 deficiency, and Alpha-Methylacyl-CoA Racemase (AMACR) deficiency.",Marc Engelen,2024
Adrenoleukodystrophy.,"X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy (ALD) is a peroxisomal disorder caused by mutations in the ABCD1 gene and characterized by impaired very long-chain fatty acid beta-oxidation. Clinically, male patients develop adrenal failure and progressive myelopathy in adulthood, although the age of onset and rate of progression are highly variable. In addition, 40% of male patients develop a leukodystrophy (cerebral ALD) before the age of 18 years. Women with ALD also develop myelopathy, but generally at a later age than men and with slower progression. Adrenal failure and leukodystrophy are exceedingly rare in women. Allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT), or more recently autologous HCT with ex vivo lentivirally transfected bone marrow, halts the leukodystrophy. Unfortunately, there is no curative treatment for the myelopathy. In this chapter, clinical spectrum of ALD is discussed in detail.","Marc Engelen, Stephan Kemp, Florian Eichler",2024
Ataluren-mediated nonsense variant readthrough in D-bifunctional protein deficiency: A case report.,"D-bifunctional protein (DBP) deficiency, a fatal peroxisomal enzyme disorder, typically manifests with life-threatening symptoms in the first two years of childhood. We present the case of an infant with elevated lysophosphatidylcholine C26:0 (C26:0-LPC) levels identified during X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy (ALD) screening, leading to a diagnosis of DBP deficiency due to a homozygous <i>HSD17B4</i> c.1041T>A, p.(Tyr347Ter) variant. Starting at two months of age, the infant experienced seizures, hypotonia, and developmental delays, prompting the initiation of experimental treatment with the readthrough agent PTC124 (ataluren) at six months. The treatment led to a decrease in C26:0-LPC levels from 0.65 μM to 0.53 μM; concomitant fish oil supplementation transiently increased C26:0-LPC to 0.74 μM before returning to 0.53 μM after cessation of supplementation. The patient demonstrated improved swallowing and progressive motor and speech development during a two-year treatment period, with no further seizures. This case report highlights the potential of nonsense readthrough therapy for peroxisomal disorders, a group of metabolic diseases that currently lack targeted treatments.","Rai-Hseng Hsu, Ni-Chung Lee, Hui-An Chen, Wuh-Liang Hwu, Wang-Tso Lee, Yin-Hsiu Chien",2024
Gene therapy for the leukodystrophies: From preclinical animal studies to clinical trials.,"Leukodystrophies are progressive single gene disorders affecting the white matter of the brain. Several gene therapy trials are in progress to address the urgent unmet need for this patient population. We performed a comprehensive literature review of all gene therapy clinical trials listed in www.clinicaltrials.gov through August 2024, and the relevant preclinical studies that enabled clinical translation. Of the approximately 50 leukodystrophies described to date, only eight have existing gene therapy clinical trials: metachromatic leukodystrophy, X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy, globoid cell leukodystrophy, Canavan disease, giant axonal neuropathy, GM2 gangliosidoses, Alexander disease and Pelizaeus-Merzbacher disease. What led to the emergence of gene therapy trials for these specific disorders? What preclinical data or disease context was enabling? For each of these eight disorders, we first describe its pathophysiology and clinical presentation. We discuss the impact of gene therapy delivery route, targeted cell type, delivery modality, dosage, and timing on therapeutic efficacy. We note that use of allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation in some leukodystrophies allowed for an accelerated path to clinic even in the absence of available animal models. In other leukodystrophies, small and large animal model studies enabled clinical translation of experimental gene therapies. Human clinical trials for the leukodystrophies include ex vivo lentiviral gene delivery, in vivo AAV-mediated gene delivery, and intrathecal antisense oligonucleotide approaches. We outline adverse events associated with each modality focusing specifically on genotoxicity and immunotoxicity. We review monitoring and management of events related to insertional mutagenesis and immune responses. The data presented in this review show that gene therapy, while promising, requires systematic monitoring to account for the precarious disease biology and the adverse events associated with new technology.","Jasna Metovic, Yedda Li, Yi Gong, Florian Eichler",2024
Lipidomic biomarkers in plasma correlate with disease severity in adrenoleukodystrophy.,"X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy (ALD) is a neurometabolic disorder caused by pathogenic variants in ABCD1 resulting very long-chain fatty acids (VLCFA) accumulation in plasma and tissues. Males can present with various clinical manifestations, including adrenal insufficiency, spinal cord disease, and leukodystrophy. Female patients typically develop spinal cord disease and peripheral neuropathy. Predicting the clinical outcome of an individual patient remains impossible due to the lack of genotype-phenotype correlation and predictive biomarkers.","Yorrick R J Jaspers, Hemmo A F Yska, Caroline G Bergner, Inge M E Dijkstra, Irene C Huffnagel, Marije M C Voermans, Eric Wever, Gajja S Salomons, Frédéric M Vaz, Aldo Jongejan, Jill Hermans, Rebecca K Tryon, Troy C Lund, Wolfgang Köhler, Marc Engelen, Stephan Kemp",2024
A female adult-onset X-ALD patient with pure cerebellar symptoms:a case report.,"X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy (X-ALD) caused by ATP-binding cassette subfamily D member 1 (<i>ABCD1</i>) gene defects is the most common inherited peroxisomal disorder.The female cerebello-brainstem dominant type in which cerebellum and brainstem are mainly involved is very rare. We report a 40-year-old female who was diagnosed as the rare disorder with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and genetic analysis mainly. Her initial symptoms were progressive slurred speech and writing disturbance. Her brain MRI showed obvious atrophy of brainstem and cerebellum. She did not have adrenal insufficiency. Genetic analysis showed a heterozygous missense mutation in exon 4 of the coding region of <i>ABCD1</i> (c.1252C > T, p.Arg418Trp).This is the first report of this particular mutation being associated with the cerebello-brainstem dominant phenotype of X-ALD, as well as the first description of this X-ALD variant in a (heterozygous) female patient.X-ALD should be considered in young and middle-aged patients with slow-progressing ataxia and dysarthria.","Wenjing Qi, Du Cao, Lei Hao, Xiuming Guo",2024
Innovative tree-based method for sampling molecular conformations: exploring the ATP-binding cassette subfamily D member 1 (ABCD1) transporter as a case study.,"We introduce a novel tree-based method for visualizing molecular conformation sampling. Our method offers enhanced precision in highlighting conformational differences and facilitates the observation of local minimas within proteins fold space. The projection of empirical laboratory data on the tree allows us to create a link between protein conformations and disease relevant data. To demonstrate the efficacy of our approach, we applied it to the ATP-binding cassette subfamily D member 1 (ABCD1) transporter responsible for very long-chain fatty acids (VLCFAs) import into peroxisomes. The genetic disorder called X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy (XALD) is characterized by the accumulation of VLCFA due to pathogenic variants in the ABCD1 gene. Using <i>in silico</i> molecular simulation, we examined the behavior of 16 prevalent mutations alongside the wild-type protein, exploring both inward and outward open forms of the transporter through molecular simulations. We evaluated from resulting trajectories the energy potential related to the ABCD1 interactions with ATP molecules. We categorized XALD patients based on the severity and progression of their disease, providing a unique clinical perspective. By integrating this data into our numerical framework, our study aimed to uncover the molecular underpinnings of XALD, offering new insights into disease progression. As we explored molecular trajectories and conformations resulting from our study, the tree-based method not only contributes valuable insights into XALD but also lays a solid foundation for forthcoming drug design studies. We advocate for the broader adoption of our innovative approach, proposing it as a valuable tool for researchers engaged in molecular simulation studies.","Thomas Haschka, Foudil Lamari, Fanny Mochel, Violetta Zujovic",2024
Hematopoietic stem cell therapy and ex vivo gene therapy for X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy.,"X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy (ALD) is a peroxisomal disorder that leads to progressive neurodegeneration in brain and spinal cord. The most devastating phenotype of childhood cerebral ALD can be halted by allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation but the procedure remains cumbersome and limited by engraftment problems and graft versus host disease. This is particularly difficult for boys with more advanced brain lesions and neurologic impairment. Fortunately, newborn screening has led to regular monitoring and increased detection of cerebral ALD in early symptomatic or asymptomatic stages. Adults with ALD can also develop cerebral ALD but here implementation of HSCT is more challenging due to vulnerabilities not seen in childhood cerebral ALD. More recently the hematopoietic stem cell approach has given rise to a first ex vivo lentiviral gene therapy for this rare disorder. Over 60 boys with cerebral ALD have received ex vivo lentiviral gene therapy worldwide. While the approach is effective in halting progression of early-stage inflammatory demyelination in brain and prevents engraft problems and graft versus host disease, there have also been cases of myelodysplastic syndrome emerging. In September of 2022, the FDA granted accelerated approval of ex vivo lentiviral gene therapy to slow the progression of neurologic dysfunction in boys 4-17years of age with early, active cerebral ALD. We describe the history of these developments, outline the pathophysiology of the disorder and the corresponding rationale of hematopoietic stem cell therapy as well as current developments in the field.","Florian S Eichler, Joern-Sven Kuehl",2024
[Adrenal insufficiency as part of X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy].," X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy (X-ALD) is a severe neurodegenerative metabolic disease with a frequency 1:17,000 in newborn boys. Being a major part of X-ALD with an incidence of 70-80% of patients, adrenal insufficiency (AI) is a life-threatening condition without timely treatment. The possibility of developing AI during the whole disease duration and the absence of any predictive factor for AI joining shows the necessity of studying AI in X-ALD patients to optimize current diagnostic and treatment algorithms.","S R Enikeeva, I S Chugunov, M A Kareva, M V Kurkina, E Y Zakharova, S V Michailova, O B Bezlepkina, V A Peterkova, N G Mokrysheva",2023
"Newborn Screening for X-Linked Adrenoleukodystrophy (X-ALD): Biochemical, Molecular, and Clinical Characteristics of Other Genetic Conditions.","The state of California (CA) added X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy (X-ALD) to newborn screening (NBS) in 2016 via the measurement of C26:0-lysophosphatidylcholine (C26:0-LPC) in a two-tier fashion, followed by sequencing of the <i>ABCD1</i> gene. This has resulted in the identification of individuals with genetic conditions beyond X-ALD that can also result in elevated C26:0-LPC by NBS. We describe the biochemical, molecular, and clinical characteristics of nine patients from two metabolic centers in California who screened positive by NBS for elevated C26:0-LPC between 2016 and 2022 and were ultimately diagnosed with a genetic condition other than X-ALD. Seven individuals were diagnosed with Zellweger spectrum disorder (ZSD) due to biallelic variants in <i>PEX</i> genes. One male was diagnosed with Klinefelter syndrome and one female was found to have an X chromosome contiguous gene deletion syndrome after the identification of a heterozygous VUS and hemizygous VUS variant in <i>ABCD1,</i> respectively. Patients with ZSD had significantly higher first- and second-tier C26:0-LPC levels compared to the two non-ZSD cases. Identification of children with ZSD and atypical patterns of <i>ABCD1</i> variants is a secondary benefit of NBS for X-ALD, leading to earlier diagnosis, prompt therapeutic initiation, and more accurate genetic counseling. As screening for X-ALD continues via the measurement of C26:0-LPC, our knowledge of additional genetic conditions associated with elevated C26:0-LPC will continue to advance, allowing for increased recognition of other genetic disorders for which early intervention is warranted.","Carlos F Mares Beltran, Christina G Tise, Rebekah Barrick, Annie D Niehaus, Rebecca Sponberg, Richard Chang, Gregory M Enns, Jose E Abdenur",2024
Pathophysiology of X-Linked Adrenoleukodystrophy: Updates on Molecular Mechanisms.,"X-ALD, an inherited monogenic metabolic disorder affecting the CNS and adrenal white matter, is caused by mutations in ABCD1 gene leading to defective fatty acid oxidation in the peroxisomes. This results in accumulation of very long-chain fatty acids, VLCFA, into brain, spinal cord, and body fluids. A single ABCD1mutation does not clearly explain the severity and diverse clinical spectrum of X-ALD phenotypes which suggests that not only genetic but also other modifier genes, epigenetic factors, and environmental factors play a role and contribute to neuroinflammation, mitochondrial dysfunctions, oxidative stress, and metabolic defects seen in phenotypes of ALD. In this review we discuss genotype and phenotype correlation and clinical spectra of X-ALD, previous and recent modifier genetic factors of X-ALD, including novel role of microRNAs (miRNAs) in pathology and as biomarkers. We also discuss the mechanistic interplay of miRNAs and metabolic pathways and potential of targeting miRNAs for X-ALD.","Parveen Parasar, Navtej Kaur, Jaspreet Singh",2024

Burden of illness and mortality in men with Adrenomyeloneuropathy: a retrospective cohort study.,"Adrenomyeloneuropathy (AMN) is a neurodegenerative disease phenotype of X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy (ALD), resulting in progressive myeloneuropathy causing spastic paraparesis, sensory ataxia, and bowel/bladder symptoms. We conducted a retrospective cohort study using two large administrative databases to characterize mortality and the burden of illness in adult men with AMN in the US.","Joshua L Bonkowsky, Bridget Healey, Naomi C Sacks, Ronaé McLin, Philip L Cyr, Eileen K Sawyer, Christopher D Stephen, Florian Eichler",2024
Nephrotic syndrome and adrenoleukodystrophy in a 5-year-old boy.,"Nephrotic syndrome is a common condition characterized by filtration of large amounts of protein, hypoalbuminemia, reduced plasma oncotic pressure, sodium retention, and edema. The mechanism responsible for sodium retention in this condition is still controversial. Two different pathophysiological pathways have been proposed to explain edema formation: activation of neurohumoral effector mechanisms, including the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, or abnormal intrinsic/primary renal sodium retention. A 5-year-old boy with X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy presented with bilateral leg swelling, massive proteinuria, and hypoalbuminemia. Minimal change disease was diagnosed. The patient was initially treated with corticosteroids and experienced several relapses. The progression of fractional excretion of sodium correlated with proteinuria and undetectable aldosterone levels. This unusual finding suggests that the mechanism of tubular sodium avidity in this child with mineralocorticoid insufficiency was independent of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system.","Corina Ramona Nicolescu, Marie-Pierre Lavocat, Jean-Louis Stephan",2024
Easily misdiagnosed X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy.,"Addison's disease and X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy (X-ALD) (Addison's-only) are two diseases that need to be identified. Addison's disease is easy to diagnose clinically when only skin and mucosal pigmentation symptoms are present. However, X-ALD (Addison's-only) caused by ABCD1 gene variation is ignored, thus losing the opportunity for early treatment. This study described two patients with initial clinical diagnosis of Addison's disease. However, they rapidly developed neurological symptoms triggered by infection. After further genetic testing, the two patients were diagnosed with X-ALD.","Qiu-Hong Wang, Yang-Yang Wang, Jing Wang, Li-Ying Liu, Jing Gao, Guo-Zhen Hao, Chen Chen, Qian Lu, Shuo Dun, Qi Zhang, Li-Ping Zou",2024
Role of ACSBG1 in brain lipid metabolism and X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy pathogenesis: Insights from a knockout mouse model.,"The ""bubblegum"" acyl-CoA synthetase (ACSBG1) is a pivotal player in lipid metabolism during the development of the mouse brain, facilitating the activation of long-chain fatty acids (LCFAs) and their integration into essential lipid species crucial for brain function. Through its enzymatic activity, ACSBG1 converts LCFAs into acyl-CoA derivatives, supporting vital processes like membrane formation, myelination, and energy production. Its regulatory role significantly influences neuronal growth, synaptic plasticity, and overall brain development, highlighting its importance in maintaining lipid homeostasis and proper brain function. Originally discovered in the fruit fly brain, ACSBG1 attracted attention for its potential implication in X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy (XALD) pathogenesis. Studies using Drosophila melanogaster lacking the ACSBG1 homolog, bubblegum, revealed adult neurodegeneration with elevated levels of very long-chain fatty acids (VLCFA). To explore ACSBG1's role in fatty acid (FA) metabolism and its relevance to XALD, we created an ACSBG1 knockout (Acsbg1<sup>-/-</sup>) mouse model and examined its impact on lipid metabolism during mouse brain development. Phenotypically, Acsbg1<sup>-/-</sup> mice resembled wild type (w.t.) mice. Despite its primary expression in tissues affected by XALD, brain, adrenal gland and testis, ACSBG1 depletion did not significantly reduce total ACS enzyme activity in these tissues when using LCFA or VLCFA as substrates. However, analysis unveiled intriguing developmental and compositional changes in FA levels associated with ACSBG1 deficiency. In the adult mouse brain, ACSBG1 expression peaked in the cerebellum, with lower levels observed in other brain regions. Developmentally, ACSBG1 expression in the cerebellum was initially low during the first week of life but increased dramatically thereafter. Cerebellar FA levels were assessed in both w.t. and Acsbg1<sup>-/-</sup> mouse brains throughout development, revealing notable differences. While saturated VLCFA levels were typically high in XALD tissues and in fruit flies lacking ACSBG1, cerebella from Acsbg1<sup>-/-</sup> mice displayed lower saturated VLCFA levels, especially after about 8 days of age. Additionally, monounsaturated ω9 FA levels exhibited a similar trend as saturated VLCFA, while ω3 polyunsaturated FA levels were elevated in Acsbg1<sup>-/-</sup> mice. Further analysis of specific FA levels provided additional insights into potential roles for ACSBG1. Notably, the decreased VLCFA levels in Acsbg1<sup>-/-</sup> mice primarily stemmed from changes in C24:0 and C26:0, while reduced ω9 FA levels were mainly observed in C18:1 and C24:1. ACSBG1 depletion had minimal effects on saturated long-chain FA or ω6 polyunsaturated FA levels but led to significant increases in specific ω3 FA, such as C20:5 and C22:5. Moreover, the impact of ACSBG1 deficiency on the developmental expression of several cerebellar FA metabolism enzymes, including those required for synthesis of ω3 polyunsaturated FA, was assessed; these FA can potentially be converted into bioactive signaling molecules like eicosanoids and docosanoids. In conclusion, despite compelling circumstantial evidence, it is unlikely that ACSBG1 directly contributes to the pathology of XALD. Instead, the effects of ACSBG1 knockout on processes regulated by eicosanoids and/or docosanoids should be further investigated.","Xiaoli Ye, Yuanyuan Li, Domingo González-Lamuño, Zhengtong Pei, Ann B Moser, Kirby D Smith, Paul A Watkins",2024
Childhood Cerebral Adrenoleukodystrophy: Case Report and Literature Review Advocating for Newborn Screening.,"X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy (ALD) is a rare genetic disorder caused by a pathogenic variant of the ABCD1 gene, leading to impaired peroxisomal function and the accumulation of very long-chain fatty acids (VLCFAs). ALD presents a wide range of neurological and adrenal symptoms, ranging from childhood cerebral adrenoleukodystrophy to adrenomyeloneuropathy and adrenal insufficiency.

Generating human AMN and cALD iPSC-derived astrocytes with potential for modeling X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy phenotypes.,"X-adrenoleukodystrophy (X-ALD) is a peroxisomal metabolic disorder caused by mutations in the ABCD1 gene encoding the peroxisomal ABC transporter adrenoleukodystrophy protein (ALDP). Similar mutations in ABCD1 may result in a spectrum of phenotypes in males with slow progressing adrenomyeloneuropathy (AMN) and fatal cerebral adrenoleukodystrophy (cALD) dominating the majority of cases. Mouse model of X-ALD does not capture the phenotype differences and an appropriate model to investigate mechanism of disease onset and progress remains a critical need. Induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived and cell models derived from them have provided useful tools for investigating cell-type specific disease mechanisms. Here, we generated induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) lines from skin fibroblasts of two each of apparently healthy control, AMN and cALD patients with non-integrating mRNA-based reprogramming. iPSC lines expanded normally and expressed pluripotency markers Oct4, SOX2, Nanog, SSEA and TRA-1-60. Expression of markers SOX17, brachyury, Desmin, Oxt2 and beta tubulin III demonstrated the ability of the iPSCs to differentiate into all three germ layers. iPSC-derived lines from CTL, AMN and cALD male patients were differentiated into astrocytes. Differentiated AMN and cALD astrocytes lacked ABCD1 expression and accumulated VLCFA, a hallmark of X-ALD. These patient astrocytes provide disease-relevant tools to investigate mechanism of differential neuroinflammatory response and metabolic reprogramming in X-ALD. Further these patient-derived human astrocyte cell models will be valuable for testing new therapeutics.","Navtej Kaur, Jaspreet Singh",2024
Leriglitazone halts disease progression in adult patients with early cerebral adrenoleukodystrophy.,"Cerebral adrenoleukodystrophy (CALD) is an X-linked rapidly progressive demyelinating disease leading to death usually within a few years. The standard of care is haematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT), but many men are not eligible due to age, absence of a matched donor or lesions of the corticospinal tracts (CST). Based on the ADVANCE study showing that leriglitazone decreases the occurrence of CALD, we treated 13 adult CALD patients (19-67 years of age) either not eligible for HSCT (n = 8) or awaiting HSCT (n = 5). Patients were monitored every 3 months with standardized neurological scores, plasma biomarkers and brain MRI comprising lesion volumetrics and diffusion tensor imaging. The disease stabilized clinically and radiologically in 10 patients with up to 2 years of follow-up. Five patients presented with gadolinium enhancing CST lesions that all turned gadolinium negative and, remarkably, regressed in four patients. Plasma neurofilament light chain levels stabilized in all 10 patients and correlated with lesion load. The two patients who continued to deteriorate were over 60 years of age with prominent cognitive impairment. One patient died rapidly from coronavirus disease 2019. These results suggest that leriglitazone can arrest disease progression in adults with early-stage CALD and may be an alternative treatment to HSCT.","Marianne Golse, Isabelle Weinhofer, Bernardo Blanco, Magali Barbier, Elise Yazbeck, Camille Huiban, Boris Chaumette, Bertrand Pichon, Ali Fatemi, Silvia Pascual, Marc Martinell, Johannes Berger, Vincent Perlbarg, Damien Galanaud, Fanny Mochel",2024
In vivo adenine base editing rescues adrenoleukodystrophy in a humanized mouse model.,"X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy (ALD), an inherited neurometabolic disorder caused by mutations in ABCD1, which encodes the peroxisomal ABC transporter, mainly affects the brain, spinal cord, adrenal glands, and testes. In ALD patients, very-long-chain fatty acids (VLCFAs) fail to enter the peroxisome and undergo subsequent β-oxidation, resulting in their accumulation in the body. It has not been tested whether in vivo base editing or prime editing can be harnessed to ameliorate ALD. We developed a humanized mouse model of ALD by inserting a human cDNA containing the pathogenic variant into the mouse Abcd1 locus. The humanized ALD model showed increased levels of VLCFAs. To correct the mutation, we tested both base editing and prime editing and found that base editing using ABE8e(V106W) could correct the mutation in patient-derived fibroblasts at an efficiency of 7.4%. Adeno-associated virus (AAV)-mediated systemic delivery of NG-ABE8e(V106W) enabled robust correction of the pathogenic variant in the mouse brain (correction efficiency: ∼5.5%), spinal cord (∼5.1%), and adrenal gland (∼2%), leading to a significant reduction in the plasma levels of C26:0/C22:0. This established humanized mouse model and the successful correction of the pathogenic variant using a base editor serve as a significant step toward treating human ALD disease.","Ramu Gopalappa, MinYoung Lee, Globinna Kim, Eul Sik Jung, Hanahrae Lee, Hye-Yeon Hwang, Jong Geol Lee, Su Jung Kim, Hyun Ju Yoo, Young Hoon Sung, Daesik Kim, In-Jeoung Baek, Hyongbum Henry Kim",2024
Four-dimensional lipidomics profiling in X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy using trapped ion mobility mass spectrometry.,"Lipids play pivotal roles in an extensive range of metabolic and physiological processes. In recent years, the convergence of trapped ion mobility spectrometry and MS has enabled 4D-lipidomics, a highly promising technology for comprehensive lipid analysis. 4D-lipidomics assesses lipid annotations across four distinct dimensions-retention time, collisional cross section, m/z (mass-to-charge ratio), and MS/MS spectra-providing a heightened level of confidence in lipid annotation. These advantages prove particularly valuable when investigating complex disorders involving lipid metabolism, such as adrenoleukodystrophy (ALD). ALD is characterized by the accumulation of very-long-chain fatty acids (VLCFAs) due to pathogenic variants in the ABCD1 gene. A comprehensive 4D-lipidomics strategy of ALD fibroblasts demonstrated significant elevations of various lipids from multiple classes. This indicates that the changes observed in ALD are not confined to a single lipid class and likely impacts a broad spectrum of lipid-mediated physiological processes. Our findings highlight the incorporation of mainly saturated and monounsaturated VLCFA variants into a range of lipid classes, encompassing phosphatidylcholines, triacylglycerols, and cholesterol esters. These include ultra-long-chain fatty acids with a length of up to thirty carbon atoms. Lipid species containing C26:0 and C26:1 were the most frequently detected VLCFA lipids in our study. Furthermore, we report a panel of 121 new candidate biomarkers in fibroblasts, exhibiting significant differentiation between controls and individuals with ALD. In summary, this study demonstrates the capabilities of a 4D-lipid profiling workflow in unraveling novel insights into the intricate lipid modifications associated with metabolic disorders like ALD.","Yorrick R J Jaspers, Sven W Meyer, Mia L Pras-Raves, Inge M E Dijkstra, Eric J M Wever, Adrie D Dane, Jan-Bert van Klinken, Gajja S Salomons, Riekelt H Houtkooper, Marc Engelen, Stephan Kemp, Michel Van Weeghel, Frédéric M Vaz",2024
International validation of meaningfulness of postural sway and gait to assess myeloneuropathy in adults with adrenoleukodystrophy.,"The most common manifestation of X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy (ALD) is a slowly progressive myeloneuropathy, which leads to imbalance and gait disturbances. The variable progression of the disease complicates evaluation of its progression rate. Wearable sensors allow for easy and frequent balance and gait collection. This study reports baseline data from a longitudinal study on the quantitative assessment of balance and gait with wearable sensors and their clinical relevance.","Hemmo A F Yska, Bela R Turk, Ali Fatemi, Jordan Goodman, Marije Voermans, Dan Amos, Man Amanat, Stephanie van de Stadt, Marc Engelen, Amena Smith-Fine, Jennifer Keller",2024
Imbalanced mitochondrial dynamics contributes to the pathogenesis of X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy.,"The peroxisomal disease adrenoleukodystrophy (X-ALD) is caused by loss of the transporter of very-long-chain fatty acids (VLCFAs), ABCD1. An excess of VLCFAs disrupts essential homeostatic functions crucial for axonal maintenance, including redox metabolism, glycolysis and mitochondrial respiration. As mitochondrial function and morphology are intertwined, we set out to investigate the role of mitochondrial dynamics in X-ALD models. Using quantitative 3D transmission electron microscopy, we revealed mitochondrial fragmentation in corticospinal axons in Abcd1- mice. In patient fibroblasts, an excess of VLCFAs triggers mitochondrial fragmentation through the redox-dependent phosphorylation of DRP1 (DRP1S616). The blockade of DRP1-driven fission by the peptide P110 effectively preserved mitochondrial morphology. Furthermore, mRNA inhibition of DRP1 not only prevented mitochondrial fragmentation but also protected axonal health in a Caenorhabditis elegans model of X-ALD, underscoring DRP1 as a potential therapeutic target. Elevated levels of circulating cell-free mtDNA in patients' CSF align this leukodystrophy with primary mitochondrial disorders. Our findings underscore the intricate interplay between peroxisomal dysfunction, mitochondrial dynamics and axonal integrity in X-ALD, shedding light on potential avenues for therapeutic intervention.","Nathalie Launay, Jone Lopez-Erauskin, Patrizia Bianchi, Sanjib Guha, Janani Parameswaran, Andrea Coppa, Lorenzo Torreni, Agatha Schlüter, Stéphane Fourcade, Abraham J Paredes-Fuentes, Rafael Artuch, Carlos Casasnovas, Montserrat Ruiz, Aurora Pujol",2024
