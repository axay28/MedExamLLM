"Skeletal Muscle Involvement in Friedreich Ataxia Friedreich Ataxia (FRDA) is an inherited neuromuscular disorder triggered by a deficit of the mitochondrial protein frataxin. At a cellular level, frataxin deficiency results in insufficient iron–sulfur cluster biosynthesis and impaired mitochondrial function and adenosine triphosphate production.
