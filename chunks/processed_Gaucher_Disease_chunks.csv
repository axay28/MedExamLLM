Besides, saRNA technology, with its lower dosage, reduced side effects, and prolonged efficacy thanks to RDRP, is emerging as a superior alternative for protein replacement therapies. Thus, saRNA appears to become a “game changer” in protein deficiency disorders and it fuels great hope for the GD research community. However, the GD research based on the nucleic",29_100,A review on Gaucher disease: therapeutic potential of β-glucocerebrosidase-targeted mRNA/saRNA approach,2024,,Gaucher_Disease
"However, the GD research based on the nucleic acid-based technique may be initiated with a conventional mRNA strategy due to its established sophistication and reliability. Then, it may get advanced with saRNA technology leveraging its potential for increased efficacy. Remarkably, GD2 is a rare and severe form of GD and ERT is not sufficiently effective due to the disability to cross the BBB and reach the CNS where the disease primarily affects. This necessitates alternative treatment approaches such as",29_101,A review on Gaucher disease: therapeutic potential of β-glucocerebrosidase-targeted mRNA/saRNA approach,2024,,Gaucher_Disease
"alternative treatment approaches such as SRT or gene therapy for GD2. Hence, the proposed GCase-mRNA/saRNA technology as a protein replacement therapy for GD patients is intended to be a step forward to aid in therapy development that will be beneficial in terms of prolonging the lifespan and improving the overall quality of life of the GD population. However, it is important to note that certain obstacles, including the right delivery formulations, therapy crossing the BBB, etc., exist in this direction",29_102,A review on Gaucher disease: therapeutic potential of β-glucocerebrosidase-targeted mRNA/saRNA approach,2024,,Gaucher_Disease
"crossing the BBB, etc., exist in this direction and need to be surpassed. Taken together, mRNA/saRNA with its feasibility, simplicity, and rapid and cost-effective manufacturing technique may lead to the successful development of protein replacement therapeutics for GD.",29_103,A review on Gaucher disease: therapeutic potential of β-glucocerebrosidase-targeted mRNA/saRNA approach,2024,,Gaucher_Disease
