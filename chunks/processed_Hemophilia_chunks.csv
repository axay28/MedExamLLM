"trials warrant attention in this regard. To begin, the effects of gene therapy, particularly for hemophilia A, appear to decrease over time [<xref rid=""bib68"" ref-type=""bibr"">68</xref>]. If a cure is supposed to be “lifelong” or “durable,” as many authors imply, it is thus questionable if gene therapy for hemophilia A lives up to this promise, even if it may meet the criteria of a cure as set out by a definition with a time limit of 5 years. Further, many people require immunosuppressive therapy to treat",29_28,Can hemophilia be cured? It depends on the definition,27 8 2024,,Hemophilia
"people require immunosuppressive therapy to treat liver enzyme elevations after gene therapy [<xref rid=""bib69"" ref-type=""bibr"">69</xref>]. If this additional treatment is required, it is questionable if gene therapy can be considered a “single treatment.” Furthermore, as gene therapy does not impact the underlying gene mutation, hemophilia will still be passed on to future generations, which might impact people’s perception of being “cured.” Third, current debates raise the question of whether there",29_29,Can hemophilia be cured?

"debates raise the question of whether there should be an overarching, agreed-upon definition of cure. It appears that currently, many authors seem to have <italic toggle=""yes"">interpretations</italic> of what a cure means rather than explicit <italic toggle=""yes"">definitions</italic>. This is not in itself problematic. In a recent paper, we argued that different cure concepts for gene therapy may coexist as long as each concept is capable of serving the goals it is supposed to serve in a given context",29_30,Can hemophilia be cured?

"goals it is supposed to serve in a given context [<xref rid=""bib70"" ref-type=""bibr"">70</xref>]. Nonetheless, in the debate on hemophilia classification, there appears to be a desire for one clear, agreed-upon definition. Incorporating the notion of cure in core outcome sets appears to be a move toward a standardized definition of cure. If there is a desire or need to provide an explicit definition of cure, several questions arise.

Moreover, similar to concerns arising in the discussion surrounding classification of hemophilia, would it be problematic if a definition is used in a context for which it was not developed? We have shown that the term “cure” is used ambiguously in the field of hemophilia, referring to various potential outcomes. Some of these interpretations appear mainly focused on normalization of clotting factor levels and bleeding symptoms, whereas others",29_32,Can hemophilia be cured?

Similarly, whereas many interpretations focus on the long-lasting effects of cure, some incorporate a (limited) 5-year durability in the definition of cure. Further, we have shown how the discussions surrounding the classification of hemophilia and the concepts of health and disease relate to the discussion on cure.
