This may be attributed to the recent promotion of multidisciplinary therapy in China, which encompasses respiratory intervention and enhancement of guardians and medical care. In patients with SMA Type 1, the mean age of onset and survival status of the three subtypes (types 1a, 1b, and 1c) differed significantly, which is comparable to the findings of previous international studies (<xref rid=""ref9"" ref-type=""bibr"">9</xref>, <xref rid=""ref19""",19_11,"Association among biomarkers, phenotypes, and motor milestones in Chinese patients with 5q spinal muscular atrophy types 1–3",02 9 2024,,Spinal_Muscular_Atrophy
