Collision tumor is mostly the fusion growth of a benign tumor and a malignant tumor, and the most common type is tumor-to-tumor metastasis. As a recipient, the benign tumor is often characterized by slow growth and rich blood vessels, thus becomes a potential metastatic site over a long time. In the collision tumors of CNS, the most common recipient tumor is meningioma, while schwannoma, pituitary adenoma also have been reported.
