It is unclear why the pathological process results in spinal cord degeneration only in some and cerebral ALD or adrenal insufficiency in others. A number of mechanisms have been proposed. Firstly, in unpublished work from our group, we show that C26:0 LPC levels correlate to disease severity.

Moreover, patients with a severe myelopathy have higher plasma levels than patients with relatively mild spinal cord disease. Secondly, although ALD is generally considered a monogenic disease, several lines of evidence point towards a role for modifier genes. A clear genotype-phenotype correlation has never been established, and identical <italic toggle=""yes"">ABCD1</italic> pathogenic variants",12_14,The pathology of X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy: tissue specific changes as a clue to pathophysiology,28 3 2024,,X-linked_Adrenoleukodystrophy

Nerve root enhancement has been seen in other leukodystrophies such as globoid cell leukodystrophy and metachromatic leukodystrophy. This case also demonstrates comorbid X-ALD with CIDP and highlights possible mechanisms from the literature for this association.
