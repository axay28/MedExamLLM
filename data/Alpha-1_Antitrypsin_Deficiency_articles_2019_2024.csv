","Alpha-1 antitrypsin (AAT), an acute-phase protein, is the most abundant protease inhibitor in plasma. AAT plays an important role in limiting host tissue destruction by proteases at sites of inflammation.<xref rid=""JCTH-2024-00201-b1"" ref-type=""bibr"">1</xref> Alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency (AATD) is a genetic condition caused by pathogenic variants in the SERPINA1 gene. The most common disease-causing variant, PiZ, causes hepatic accumulation of the misfolded pathogenic variant of AAT, predisposing individuals with AATD to develop liver disease, ranging from liver fibrosis to cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma.<xref rid=""JCTH-2024-00201-b2"" ref-type=""bibr"">2</xref> AATD individuals are also susceptible to chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) due to low levels of AAT in the plasma.<xref rid=""JCTH-2024-00201-b1"" ref-type=""bibr"">1</xref>,<xref rid=""JCTH-2024-00201-b3"" ref-type=""bibr"">3</xref> In this context, increased pro-inflammatory mediators in the sputum and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid of AATD individuals indicate the presence of early airway inflammation.<xref rid=""JCTH-2024-00201-b4"" ref-type=""bibr"">4</xref> Several studies have shown that COPD is a disease associated with systemic inflammation and higher levels of inflammatory markers in the blood, including C-reactive protein (CRP), and cytokines such as interleukin (IL)-6, TNF-alpha, and IL-8.<xref rid=""JCTH-2024-00201-b5"" ref-type=""bibr"">5</xref> The liver, the largest metabolic organ in the body, is recognized as a unique immune organ with distinctive immune characteristics. Due to its exposure to various foreign and inflammatory molecules carried by the portal vein and systemic blood, the liver’s default immune status is anti-inflammatory or immune-tolerant.<xref rid=""JCTH-2024-00201-b6"" ref-type=""bibr"">6</xref> However, a failure to mount a proper response to inflammatory stimuli or to properly regulate immune mechanisms can lead to liver disease.<xref rid=""JCTH-2024-00201-b7"" ref-type=""bibr"">7</xref> Lung injury has been shown to impact hepatic function by aggravating liver diseases through systemic inflammatory responses.<xref rid=""JCTH-2024-00201-b8"" ref-type=""bibr"">8</xref> This systemic inflammation is recently hypothesized to be one of the probable mechanisms involved in the progression of liver disease.<xref rid=""JCTH-2024-00201-b9"" ref-type=""bibr"">9</xref> The liver disease mediated by AATD is initiated by a toxic gain-of-function mechanism in which the misfolded mutant variant of AAT accumulates in hepatocytes, leading to liver disease.<xref rid=""JCTH-2024-00201-b2"" ref-type=""bibr"">2</xref> However, the relationship between AATD-associated COPD and liver disease is not well understood, despite the high prevalence of COPD in AATD individuals. In our study, we investigated the association between COPD and AATD-mediated liver disease in a prospectively recruited AATD cohort. We examined the liver phenotype using liver tissue histology and liver transcriptomic profiles from AATD individuals with and without COPD. Our histological evidence shows that AATD-associated liver inflammation and fibrosis are more prevalent in AATD individuals with COPD. The liver transcriptomic data also indicated different aspects of fibrogenesis, such as hepatic stellate cell activation and extracellular matrix deposition, in AATD individuals with COPD compared to those without COPD. These findings may pave the way for identifying new diagnostic markers of liver disease in AATD individuals with COPD and aid in developing novel preventative and therapeutic strategies for AATD-mediated liver disease.   Liver fibrosis, caused by excessive deposition of extracellular matrix proteins in the liver, occurs in most types of chronic liver diseases. The prevalence of advanced liver fibrosis in AATD patients is more than 35%.<xref rid=""JCTH-2024-00201-b13"" ref-type=""bibr"">13</xref> Many antifibrotic therapies have been developed to inhibit and control liver fibrogenesis. Although many of these therapeutic interventions are effective in experimental models of liver fibrosis, their clinical deployment has achieved limited success.<xref rid=""JCTH-2024-00201-b28"" ref-type=""bibr"">28</xref> Therefore, it is crucial to improve our knowledge about liver fibrosis mediated by AATD to develop better therapeutic strategies. Our data demonstrated that the liver transcriptome and associated functional annotations are largely overlapping in AATD individuals with COPD and those without, indicating that COPD did not act as a confounding factor in the evaluation of disease-associated transcriptome signatures in AATD liver disease. However, we observed that AATD individuals with COPD have distinct liver transcriptome signatures compared to AATD individuals with normal lung function. The liver transcriptomics of AATD individuals with COPD showed dysregulated expression of genes associated with aggravated liver fibrogenesis and damage compared to AATD individuals with normal lung function. We also observed that liver transcriptome signatures in AATD individuals with and without COPD are independent of hepatic accumulation of AAT and PAS-D scores. Consistent with liver transcriptomic data, quantitative histopathology analysis of liver tissues also revealed that AATD individuals with COPD have significantly higher liver fibrosis scores compared to those without. Hepatocellular damage, as indicated by the presence of hepatocyte ballooning, also appeared to be significantly more severe in AATD individuals with COPD compared to those without. These findings suggest that the active pathogenic process occurring in the lungs of AATD-deficient individuals may be associated with the development of liver disease. Our results demonstrated several transcriptomic changes that are implicated in the altered deposition of extracellular matrix and cytoskeletal rearrangement in the livers of AATD individuals with COPD. Upregulation of genes related to extracellular matrix remodeling has been previously described in the progression of liver fibrosis.<xref rid=""JCTH-2024-00201-b29"" ref-type=""bibr"">29</xref> For example, <italic toggle=""yes"">de novo</italic> expression of smooth muscle <italic toggle=""yes"">ACTA2</italic>, <italic toggle=""yes"">DES</italic>, and collagen are common features of hepatic stellate cell activation and initiation of liver fibrogenesis.<xref rid=""JCTH-2024-00201-b30"" ref-type=""bibr"">30</xref> Upregulation of <italic toggle=""yes"">TIMP-1</italic> is also considered to promote fibrosis by inhibiting matrix metalloproteases.<xref rid=""JCTH-2024-00201-b20"" ref-type=""bibr"">20</xref> Here, we noted upregulation of <italic toggle=""yes"">DES, COL3A1, TIMP1, and ACTA2</italic> in the livers of AATD individuals with COPD. Furthermore, <italic toggle=""yes"">actin, profilin,</italic> and myosin light chain phosphatase were also upregulated in the livers of AATD individuals with COPD. F-actin and profilin cytoskeleton reorganization are associated with hepatic stellate cell activation.<xref rid=""JCTH-2024-00201-b31"" ref-type=""bibr"">31</xref> In addition, high activity of myosin light chain phosphatase has been implicated in liver cirrhosis.<xref rid=""JCTH-2024-00201-b32"" ref-type=""bibr"">32</xref> Thus, our results confirm that dysregulation of the extracellular matrix and cytoskeletal rearrangement genes are particularly important in AATD-mediated liver fibrosis, specifically in those subjects who have developed impaired lung function secondary to AATD. These results are consistent with our immunohistopathology observation of the greater METAVIR fibrosis score in the livers of AATD individuals with COPD compared to those with normal lung function. Hepatic transcriptomes of AATD individuals also revealed that pathways related to cellular stress and injury are activated in the livers of individuals with COPD compared to those with normal lung function. Pathway enrichment analysis showed that the DEGs in our dataset correlate with the upregulation of ERK/MAPK, p38/MAPK, VEGF, and PDGF pathways in the livers of AATD individuals with COPD. ERK signaling pathways, along with PDGF, are critical pathways in modulating the phenotypic responses of liver myofibroblasts. These pro-fibrogenic cells have been shown to significantly contribute to the advancement of fibrosis.<xref rid=""JCTH-2024-00201-b33"" ref-type=""bibr"">33</xref> According to recent studies, ERK signaling pathways play major roles in mediating liver fibrotic responses, as elicited by a number of extracellular signals,<xref rid=""JCTH-2024-00201-b34"" ref-type=""bibr"">34</xref> thus potentially revealing them as regulators of liver transcriptional changes in response to fibrotic stimuli. Our lab and others have also shown how ERK dysregulation promotes inflammatory signaling in airway epithelial cells and macrophages expressing Z-AAT,<xref rid=""JCTH-2024-00201-b35"" ref-type=""bibr"">35</xref>,<xref rid=""JCTH-2024-00201-b36"" ref-type=""bibr"">36</xref> highlighting a clear connection between a mechanism that perpetuates airway inflammation and modulates the progression of liver fibrosis. Biological pathways, including mitochondrial dysfunction and sirtuin signaling, were uncovered by IPA in the livers of AATD individuals with COPD, highlighting disturbances in key processes linked to liver fibrogenesis.<xref rid=""JCTH-2024-00201-b37"" ref-type=""bibr"">37</xref> Dysregulated mitochondrial biogenesis, along with increased production of reactive oxygen species, may cause irreversible cell growth arrest or senescence.<xref rid=""JCTH-2024-00201-b38"" ref-type=""bibr"">38</xref> Senescent hepatic stellate cells have previously been identified in liver fibrosis.<xref rid=""JCTH-2024-00201-b39"" ref-type=""bibr"">39</xref> The predictions from the liver transcriptomes of AATD individuals with COPD revealed signaling pathways similar to those previously reported in liver fibrosis. In addition to genes related to mitochondrial dysfunction, we also found downregulation of <italic toggle=""yes"">IGF-1</italic>, which has anti-fibrotic effects through attenuation of hepatic stellate cell activation, and upregulation of <italic toggle=""yes"">MIF</italic> and <italic toggle=""yes"">AGT</italic>, consistent with published evidence of their role in promoting the activation of hepatic stellate cells.<xref rid=""JCTH-2024-00201-b40"" ref-type=""bibr"">40</xref>,<xref rid=""JCTH-2024-00201-b41"" ref-type=""bibr"">41</xref> However, there were differences between our dataset and clinical cases of liver fibrosis regarding TGFβ, Hedgehog, and Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathways,<xref rid=""JCTH-2024-00201-b42"" ref-type=""bibr"">42</xref> suggesting that the fibrotic insult in AATD individuals with COPD has a distinct pathogenesis compared to other fibrotic liver diseases. Hepatocyte ballooning indicates hepatocellular damage, partly mediated by ER stress, and is associated with the enlargement and swelling of injured hepatocytes.<xref rid=""JCTH-2024-00201-b43"" ref-type=""bibr"">43</xref>,<xref rid=""JCTH-2024-00201-b44"" ref-type=""bibr"">44</xref> Our results revealed higher levels of hepatocyte ballooning in the livers of AATD individuals with COPD compared to those without. We also identified liver transcriptome changes in AATD individuals with COPD who presented with higher levels of hepatocyte ballooning, including pathways associated with impaired cell death and increased cellular viability.<xref rid=""JCTH-2024-00201-b45"" ref-type=""bibr"">45</xref> Consistent with previous reports demonstrating that hepatocyte ballooning is associated with greater fibrosis,<xref rid=""JCTH-2024-00201-b15"" ref-type=""bibr"">15</xref> our study also supports an association between hepatocyte ballooning, liver fibrosis stage, and liver-related outcomes. It has been shown that the prevalence of hepatic steatosis in AATD is about 40%, which is higher than in the general population.<xref rid=""JCTH-2024-00201-b13"" ref-type=""bibr"">13</xref> Here, we identified transcriptome changes in the livers of AATD individuals with COPD, indicating changes in lipid metabolism, including downregulation of <italic toggle=""yes"">TFF3</italic>. <italic toggle=""yes"">TFF3</italic> has been shown to upregulate peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha and subsequently reduce hepatic steatosis by increasing fatty acid oxidation.<xref rid=""JCTH-2024-00201-b46"" ref-type=""bibr"">46</xref> While we found no significant differences in hepatic steatosis scores between AATD individuals with and without COPD, the downregulation of <italic toggle=""yes"">TFF3</italic> suggests a compensatory enhancement of fatty acid oxidation to limit lipotoxicity in the livers of AATD individuals with COPD. This observation also underscores the multifaceted nature of hepatic steatosis, prompting consideration of the diverse array of variables, including alcohol consumption and obesity, that may contribute to its pathogenesis and progression.<xref rid=""JCTH-2024-00201-b47"" ref-type=""bibr"">47</xref> COPD, defined by airflow limitation caused by chronic bronchitis or emphysema,<xref rid=""JCTH-2024-00201-b48"" ref-type=""bibr"">48</xref> is a systemic inflammatory disease. Subjects with COPD exhibit evidence of systemic inflammation and high levels of CRP concentration that correlate with the level of airway obstruction.<xref rid=""JCTH-2024-00201-b49"" ref-type=""bibr"">49</xref>,<xref rid=""JCTH-2024-00201-b50"" ref-type=""bibr"">50</xref> In this context, we have previously shown evidence of systemic inflammation<xref rid=""JCTH-2024-00201-b26"" ref-type=""bibr"">26</xref> in addition to lung neutrophilic inflammation in AATD individuals.<xref rid=""JCTH-2024-00201-b4"" ref-type=""bibr"">4</xref> Systemic inflammation has also been shown to play a causal role in the development of liver injury.<xref rid=""JCTH-2024-00201-b49"" ref-type=""bibr"">49</xref> Here, we found upregulation of the CRP gene in the livers of AATD individuals with COPD (<xref rid=""JCTH-2024-00201-s003"" ref-type=""supplementary-material"">Supplementary Fig. 3A</xref>). Increased expression of CRP in the livers of AATD individuals with COPD raises the possibility that inflammatory processes contribute to the association between COPD and increased liver fibrogenesis in AATD individuals. However, the difference in plasma levels of CRP was not significant between our study groups (<xref rid=""JCTH-2024-00201-s003"" ref-type=""supplementary-material"">Supplementary Fig. 3B</xref>). This observation may be explained by the fact that CRP continues to be a nonspecific marker of systemic inflammation, and we acknowledge the active variability of CRP as an inflammatory marker. Our AATD liver transcriptome and functional annotations also revealed DEGs related to inflammation (<italic toggle=""yes"">IL1RN, IL6R, TNFR, IGF2,</italic> and <italic toggle=""yes"">EGR1</italic>) in the livers of AATD individuals with COPD. In agreement with the liver transcriptomic profile, portal inflammation was observed in the livers of these individuals. The presence of portal inflammation in the liver has been shown to be associated with advanced fibrosis.<xref rid=""JCTH-2024-00201-b14"" ref-type=""bibr"">14</xref> This suggests that portal inflammation in AATD may be associated with fibrosis progression in AATD individuals with COPD. This knowledge is crucial for developing comprehensive, targeted therapies that improve patient outcomes and advance scientific progress in managing AATD-related liver disease. Moreover, broader implications could emerge. Unraveling lung-liver interactions could shed light on important mechanisms of inflammation-related liver conditions with multi-organ effects. The strengths of our study include the recruitment of a phenotypically characterized patient cohort and clinical samples, including liver biopsy and plasma. However, this study has several limitations that need to be addressed. First, the small cohort size of AATD individuals without COPD could have influenced the significance of our results. Second, liver gene expression profiles are largely driven by the effects of hepatocytes, which represents a limitation when analyzing bulk liver transcriptomics. Therefore, single-cell RNA sequencing may be helpful in identifying the key regulators of liver fibrogenesis. Third, due to the cross-sectional nature of the AATD disease, it is not possible to make any causal inferences, and prospective research is necessary to elucidate their exact connection. Fourth, since this study examines a subcohort, it may not be fully representative of the characteristics of the entire cross-sectional cohort. Fifth, the mechanisms behind these findings have not been explored experimentally in this study, which is why our results are mostly descriptive. This will be investigated in future studies. Finally, the presence of AAT augmentation, as well as differences in sex and age, could potentially confound the analysis of liver transcription. Liver transcriptome signatures from AATD individuals with COPD identified several DEGs and further validated enhanced liver fibrogenesis, along with differences in liver fibrogenesis mechanisms compared to AATD individuals without COPD. We also demonstrated quantitative changes in histopathological fibrosis markers in AATD liver tissues from those with COPD compared to those without. Our results are consistent with previous studies indicating that impaired pulmonary function is associated with the development of liver fibrosis. Understanding the communication between the lungs and liver in AATD can provide potential targets for effective treatment strategies and reduce healthcare burdens. This also suggests that future treatment strategies for AATD individuals with liver disease may need to consider the lung function of these individuals. ",N/A,28 10 2024

</xref> However, there is a lack of data associated with circulating Z‐polymer levels and long‐term clinically relevant adverse outcomes. Here, we use data from the European Alpha‐1 Liver Cohort, a large, prospective cohort of adults with AATD, to study the association of circulating Z‐polymer levels with subsequent adverse clinical outcomes and liver fibrosis.   To advance our understanding of the role of circulating Z‐polymer in the progression of AATD‐related liver disease and its potential utility as a prognostic biomarker of disease progression, we studied the association of circulating Z‐polymer levels with adverse clinical outcomes and liver fibrosis, using data from the European Alpha‐1 Liver Cohort. Among adults with the PiZZ genotype, higher circulating Z‐polymer levels were associated with an increased risk of adverse clinical outcomes over a median 4‐year period. This increased risk was also observed among those receiving and not receiving augmentation therapy, and after adjustment for key predictors of adverse clinical outcomes. Importantly, however, the robustness of the results was limited by the relatively low precision around the corresponding HR estimates because of the relatively small number of adverse clinical outcomes observed. In a cross‐sectional analysis, baseline levels of blood Z‐polymer were weakly positively correlated with baseline measures of FibroScan® LSM. This was also true after stratification by augmentation therapy status. Generally, among adults with the PiZZ and PiMZ genotypes with available biopsy data, circulating Z‐polymer levels were positively correlated with liver Z‐polymer levels, although sample size limited the interpretability of these results. A previous study reported that circulating Z‐polymer levels were higher among adults with the PiZZ genotype who self‐reported abnormal liver function and liver cirrhosis than among those with the PiZZ genotype who did not report such history.<xref rid=""ueg212629-bib-0016"" ref-type=""bibr"">

 The results from the current study provide novel findings regarding the role of circulating Z‐polymer levels as a potential biomarker that expand the existing literature. Most importantly, these results provide some evidence of a positive association between circulating Z‐polymer and long‐term adverse clinical outcomes in adults with AATD. Further, the link to liver Z‐polymer may establish the utility of circulating Z‐polymer as a non‐invasive indicator of risk of AATD‐related liver disease. Overall, the evidence seems to indicate a positive association between circulating Z‐polymer levels and age, key comorbidities (e.g., BMI), markers of liver function and fibrosis, and adverse clinical outcomes. However, further assessment of these associations in larger cohorts with more long‐term outcomes and with more liver biopsy data than available in the current study, is warranted to establish circulating Z‐polymer as a reliable biomarker of liver disease in AATD. Moreover, the less obvious associations in the PiMZ subgroup might be related to the markedly lower Z‐polymer levels, which might also be responsible for the lower correlations seen in serial measurements. Of note, whereas previous studies of circulating Z‐polymer levels have focused primarily on patients not receiving augmentation therapy, this study involved analyses of adults with AATD receiving and not receiving augmentation therapy. Observations regarding circulating Z‐polymer among adults receiving augmentation therapy are sparse; such observations are important, especially given the evidence that Z‐AAT can co‐polymerize with non‐mutated AAT.<xref rid=""ueg212629-bib-0022"" ref-type=""bibr"">

</xref> While the associations reported here generally were similar between those receiving and not receiving augmentation therapy, those receiving augmentation therapy had higher levels of circulating Z‐polymer than those not receiving augmentation therapy (Table <xref rid=""ueg212629-tbl-0001"" ref-type=""table"">1</xref> and Figure <xref rid=""ueg212629-fig-0001"" ref-type=""fig"">1b</xref>). This is consistent with findings from previous studies and suggests that higher levels of circulating Z‐polymer in those receiving augmentation therapy may be attributable to the presence of AAT polymers in the augmentation therapy preparations.<xref rid=""ueg212629-bib-0016"" ref-type=""bibr"">

</xref> We acknowledge that it was not possible to validate this suggestion and that those receiving augmentation therapy might simply have had more advanced AATD‐related disease than those not receiving augmentation therapy (hence higher levels of circulating Z‐polymer). Also, the relationship between the timing of augmentation therapy and circulating Z‐polymer levels was not directly assessed in this study; a positive correlation between both parameters suggests that recent augmentation is associated with higher Z‐polymer levels. Further, the adverse outcomes were not limited to the liver. The fact that adults with AATD receiving augmentation therapy have a more advanced lung disease than those not receiving augmentation therapy, likely affects the number of adverse events in both subgroups. An assumption in the time‐to‐event analyses was that circulating Z‐polymer levels did not change appreciably over the course of follow‐up (median 4 years) and were treated as not varying with time. However, support for this assumption is limited, and we were not able to assess changes in circulating Z‐polymer levels among patients followed for adverse clinical outcomes, most importantly, among those who experienced liver‐related adverse clinical outcomes. A previous study reported that circulating Z‐polymer levels were stable over a 14‐day period, but this assessment was performed using data from only two patients.<xref rid=""ueg212629-bib-0004"" ref-type=""bibr"">
<sup>4</sup>
</xref> In the current study, no notable difference in circulating Z‐polymer levels was observed in a sub‐set of adults with the PiZZ and PiMZ genotypes who had repeated circulating Z‐polymer measurements around 1 year after their baseline assessment. The extent to which circulating Z‐polymer levels change over time is an important consideration in the evaluation of the utility of circulating Z‐polymer levels as a marker of clinically relevant outcomes. Further assessments of the stability of circulating Z‐polymer levels over time are warranted. We used a self‐reported questionnaire to report adverse clinical outcomes that primarily focused on liver—related events and not on lung related outcomes. Further, though the cohort of adults with the PiZZ genotype followed for adverse clinical outcomes was large, the total number of adverse clinical outcomes observed was relatively small and only half of them (14/28) were liver related. Given the small number of adverse events, we included all‐cause death (even from “other” causes) to maximize model precision. It is possible that the follow‐up period was not long enough to capture key liver‐related events (due to slow progression of liver disease) and mortality. Moreover, responses to the clinical outcome assessment questionnaire may have been incomplete or missing. Different circulating Z‐polymer level cut‐offs were used to build the binary circulating Z‐polymer variable used for each analytic PiZZ group, based on the median circulating Z‐polymer level value for each group. This strategy was selected since there is no clinically relevant cut‐off for circulating Z‐polymers. However, this approach limits the ability to compare results across the analytic groups. Notably, circulating Z‐polymer values measured by different investigators seem to differ (e.g., due to different assays) and because of that, there is a need for a standardization of employed methods. Patients who received a liver biopsy in this cohort generally had a clinical indication for liver biopsy. Therefore, the range of liver disease severity among patients with histological data in this cohort was limited, and the results of the biopsy‐based analyses may not be generalizable to a broader population of adults with AATD. Of note, this selection preference did not apply to the broader cohort of patients in this analysis who had fibrosis measured by FibroScan®. To our knowledge, this is by far the largest study to demonstrate a possible link between circulating Z‐polymer levels and adverse clinical outcomes in AATD. The results of this study indicate that circulating Z‐polymer levels is a prognostic biomarker of clinically relevant disease in adults with the PiZZ and PiMZ genotypes.

"Alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency associated with rare <italic toggle=""yes"">SERPINA1</italic> alleles p.(Phe76del) and p.(Asp280Val): A family study","This report describes family members with alpha-1 antitrypsin (AAT) deficiency arising from two rare alleles of <italic toggle=""yes"">SERPINA1</italic> – p.(Phe76del) and p.(Asp280Val) along with the more common deficiency allele, Pi*Z. The index case, a 51-year-old female presented with cough, bloody sputum, fever, weight loss and night sweats. In addition to a respiratory infection, scans revealed bronchiectasis and bronchiolitis without emphysema. Her AAT level was 30 mg/dL and genetic testing revealed a Pi*Z/p.(Phe76del) genotype. Follow up testing of her relatives revealed the rare p.(Asp280Val) variant as well. AAT deficiency remains underdiagnosed. Early detection and intervention could improve quality of life and outcomes.","Alpha-1 antitrypsin (AAT) is a glycoprotein (52 KDa) that is primarily synthesized in the liver and is transported to the lungs via the cardiovascular system. In lung tissue, AAT serves as a modulator of elastase activity and, in particular, neutrophil elastase (NE). When the homeostasis between AAT and NE is disrupted, as in AAT deficiency (AATD), elastase activity predominates resulting in lung tissue damage and dysfunction. AAT is coded for by the <italic toggle=""yes"">SERPINA1</italic> gene. The most common allele of <italic toggle=""yes"">SERPINA1</italic> is the M-allele which is associated with normal serum levels of AAT. The most common alleles associated with decreased AAT levels are the S- and Z-alleles which are associated with 40 % and 90 % reductions in serum AAT, respectively [<xref rid=""bib1"" ref-type=""bibr"">1</xref>]. In addition to these two common pathogenic alleles, over 500 additional genetic variants of <italic toggle=""yes"">SERPINA1</italic> have been identified [<xref rid=""bib2"" ref-type=""bibr"">2</xref>]. Depending on the genetic background, the mutation p.(Phe76del) leads to one of the following rare variants: Pi*MMalton (M2), Pi*MPalermo (M1Val), Pi*MNichinan (V) or Pi*Q0LaPalma (S) [<xref rid=""bib1"" ref-type=""bibr"">1</xref>] Clinical reports on patients with a p.(Phe76del) variant in combination with the Pi*Z generally showed serious lung dysfunction while reports on patients that showed this mutation in combination with Pi*M showed mixed lung and liver dysfunction [<xref rid=""bib3"" ref-type=""bibr"">3</xref>,<xref rid=""bib4"" ref-type=""bibr"">4</xref>]. The p.(Asp280Val) mutation, which is associated with Pi*PLowell (M1Val); Pi*PDuarte (M4), Pi*YBarcelona (p.Pro39His) [<xref rid=""bib1"" ref-type=""bibr"">1</xref>], has not been associated with significantly reduced AAT levels except when heterozygous with a severe deficiency allele. The p.(Asp280Val) variant when expressed with another deficiency variant, was associated with increased risk of pulmonary disease [<xref rid=""bib5"" ref-type=""bibr"">5</xref>]. Interestingly, although p.(Asp280Val) was linked to lower levels of serum AAT, the enzyme present was functioning normally [<xref rid=""bib6"" ref-type=""bibr"">6</xref>]. Bronchiectasis has been reported to be a frequent manifestation of AATD especially in individuals with Pi*ZZ genotype [<xref rid=""bib7"" ref-type=""bibr"">7</xref>]. However, the nature and prevalence of bronchiectasis in AATD has not been extensively studied [<xref rid=""bib8"" ref-type=""bibr"">8</xref>]. A recent study of 505 patients with the Pi*ZZ genotype found that 9.1 % of these patients had bronchiectasis alone and that bronchiectasis was present in 27 % of the emphysema patients [<xref rid=""bib8"" ref-type=""bibr"">8</xref>]. In this article, we describe the clinical characteristics of a family in which three AAT variants were identified: the more common Pi*Z-variant, and the rare variants p.(Phe76del) - and p.(Asp280Val). The index case has the genotype Pi*Z/p.(Phe76del) and was found to have bronchiectasis without emphysema. Written informed consent was obtained from all participants in this study to allow their de-identified information to be used in this article. Approval from the University of Regensburg Ethics Committee was not requested since the university does not require ethics committee approval for the reporting of individual patient cases. This study was completed in compliance with the Helsinki Declaration (2013 Revision) and all applicable local and national regulations. The initial patient (index case) was a 51-year-old, Caucasian female of Turkish descent that was initially seen at Krankenhaus Barmherzige Brüder in Regensburg, Germany in August 2022 with the following symptoms: cough, bloody sputum, fever, weight loss and night sweats. The patient has never been a smoker. Initial lung function tests and arterial blood gases were within normal limits: forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV1) 78 %, FEV1/forced vital capacity (FVC) 77 %, total lung capacity (TLC) 114 % and diffusing capacity of the lungs for carbon monoxide (DLCO) 104 % (<xref rid=""tbl1"" ref-type=""table"">Table 1</xref>).<table-wrap position=""float"" id=""tbl1""><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Spirometry results for the index patient at diagnosis.</p></caption><alt-text id=""alttext0020"">Table 1</alt-text><table frame=""hsides"" rules=""groups""><thead><tr><th></th><th>Target</th><th>Result</th><th>% Target</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td colspan=""4"" align=""left""><bold>Body Plethysmography</bold></td></tr><tr><td align=""left""> TLC (L)</td><td align=""left"">4.97</td><td align=""left"">5.67</td><td align=""left"">114</td></tr><tr><td align=""left""> VC In (L)</td><td align=""left"">3.12</td><td align=""left"">1.77</td><td align=""left"">57</td></tr><tr><td align=""left""> TGV (L)</td><td align=""left"">2.70</td><td align=""left"">4.00</td><td align=""left"">148</td></tr><tr><td align=""left""> RV (L)</td><td align=""left"">1.75</td><td align=""left"">2.92</td><td align=""left"">167</td></tr><tr><td align=""left""> RV/TLC (%)</td><td align=""left"">35.96</td><td align=""left"">51.44</td><td align=""left"">143</td></tr><tr><td align=""left""> Raw eff (kPa*s/L)</td><td align=""left"">0.30</td><td align=""left"">0.21</td><td align=""left"">70</td></tr><tr><td align=""left""> sRaw eff (kPa*s)</td><td align=""left"">0.96</td><td align=""left"">0.84</td><td align=""left"">87</td></tr><tr><td align=""left""> FVC (L)</td><td align=""left"">3.47</td><td align=""left"">2.75</td><td align=""left"">79</td></tr><tr><td align=""left""> FEV1 (L)</td><td align=""left"">2.78</td><td align=""left"">2.16</td><td align=""left"">78</td></tr><tr><td align=""left""> FEV1/FVC (%)</td><td align=""left"">80.52</td><td align=""left"">78.45</td><td align=""left"">97</td></tr><tr><td align=""left""> PEF (L/s)</td><td align=""left"">6.35</td><td align=""left"">4.87</td><td align=""left"">77</td></tr><tr><td align=""left""> MEF 75 (L/s)</td><td align=""left"">5.60</td><td align=""left"">4.63</td><td align=""left"">83</td></tr><tr><td align=""left""> MEF 50 (L/s)</td><td align=""left"">3.90</td><td align=""left"">2.68</td><td align=""left"">69</td></tr><tr><td align=""left""> MEF 25 (L/s)</td><td align=""left"">0.92</td><td align=""left"">0.71</td><td align=""left"">78</td></tr><tr><td align=""left""> FIV 1 (L)</td><td align=""left"">–</td><td align=""left"">1.51</td><td align=""left"">–</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""2"" align=""left""><bold>Helium/Carbon monoxide (Single Breath)</bold></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td align=""left""> DLCO (mmol/min/kPa)</td><td align=""left"">7.09</td><td align=""left"">7.35</td><td align=""left"">104</td></tr><tr><td align=""left""> KCO (mmol/min/kPa/L))</td><td align=""left"">1.46</td><td align=""left"">1.60</td><td align=""left"">110</td></tr><tr><td align=""left""> VI (L)</td><td align=""left"">3.12</td><td align=""left"">2.03</td><td align=""left"">65</td></tr><tr><td align=""left""> TLC (L)</td><td align=""left"">4.97</td><td align=""left"">4.78</td><td align=""left"">96</td></tr><tr><td align=""left""> FRC (L)</td><td align=""left"">2.70</td><td align=""left"">3.47</td><td align=""left"">128</td></tr><tr><td align=""left""> RV (L)</td><td align=""left"">1.78</td><td align=""left"">2.26</td><td align=""left"">129</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><fn><p>TLC = total lung capacity; VC = vital capacity; TGV = thoracic gas volume; RV = residual volume; Raw = airway resistance; sRaw = specific airway resistance; FVC = forced vital capacity; FEV1 = forced expiratory volume in 1 second; PEF = peak expiratory flow; MEF 75 = maximal expiratory flow at 75 % of FVC; FIV = forced inspiratory volume; DLCO = diffusing capacity of the lungs for carbon monoxide; KCO = transfer factor for carbon monoxide; VI = volume of inhaled gas; FRC = functional residual capacity.</p></fn></table-wrap-foot></table-wrap> After the patient had a bronchopulmonary infection that was resistant to a macrolide antibiotic, further tests (including computed tomography) revealed that the patient had bronchiectasis and bronchiolitis especially in the lower right lobe without emphysema (<xref rid=""fig1"" ref-type=""fig"">Fig. 1</xref>).

Eight months later there were further exacerbations of the patient's pulmonary symptoms with evidence of a <italic toggle=""yes"">Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic> infection. This infection was successfully treated with 14 days of piperacillin/tazobactam and ciprofloxacin. The AAT level in this patient was 30 mg/dL, well below the protective threshold of 50 mg/dL [<xref rid=""bib9"" ref-type=""bibr"">9</xref>]. Genetic testing (Alpha ID, Grifols, Barcelona, Spain) of the index patient revealed that the patient was compound heterozygous for the <italic toggle=""yes"">SERPINA1</italic> gene: Pi* Z/p.(Phe76del). Genotyping was performed at the German AAT Laboratory at the University of Marburg using the Progenika AAT Genotyping Kit (Progenika Biopharma, SA, Derio, Spain) which can simultaneously identify 14 deficiency variants of the <italic toggle=""yes"">SERPINA1</italic> gene based on Luminex xMAP technology (Luminex Corporation, Austin, TX, USA). The laboratory methods are described in detail elsewhere [<xref rid=""bib10"" ref-type=""bibr"">10</xref>].

In addition to the Pi*Z variant, the two rare variants p.(Phe76del), and p.(Asp280Val) were also found. The patient's mother (84 years old) was found to have the Pi*MZ genotype and has had a persistent cough for years and suffers from dyspnea on exertion. Both of the mother's husbands are deceased and one died at the age of 30 years. Based on available information, the other husband did not have any pulmonary symptoms.<fig id=""fig2""><label>Fig. 2</label><caption><p>Genetic screening of family members of the index case (III.3) for <italic toggle=""yes"">SERPINA1</italic> variants.

One sister (III.4) has the same genotype as the patient (Pi*Z/p.(Phe76del)) and has been diagnosed with ANCA-positive vasculitis. A younger sister (III.6) has the genotype (Pi*M/p.(Phe76del)) has occasional respiratory distress and is extremely sensitive to cigarette smoke. The younger sister's husband (III.7), who is from the same village, has the genotype Pi*M/p.(Asp280Val) and was diagnosed two years ago with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). His father has COPD as well. The patient's children and nieces (IV.4-IV.7) are currently living in Germany and have not been tested for insurance reasons. They are aware of the hereditable nature of AATD and all are non-smokers. AATD is an underdiagnosed, and, consequently, an undertreated disease. Screening of patient populations that are potentially AAT deficient is important so that patients with AATD could reap the potential benefits of early therapeutic intervention (e.g., smoking cessation and AAT augmentation therapy). These benefits could include slowing of disease progression. A recent longitudinal study demonstrated that AAT replacement therapy decreased the deterioration of lung function in patients with less severe disease (GOLD Stage 2) and decreased overall mortality in the AATD population studied [<xref rid=""bib11"" ref-type=""bibr"">11</xref>]. The case reported here is remarkable for its phenotypic presentation. This patient had pulmonary infectious symptomology with bronchiectasis but without significant emphysema. Greulich et al. reported that the presence of bronchiectasis was a strong predictor of the Pi*ZZ genotype and advocated AATD testing in patients with bronchiectasis in the absence of emphysema or COPD, i.e., in patients with a similar phenotype to the patient in this case [<xref rid=""bib12"" ref-type=""bibr"">12</xref>]. A recent analysis of the European Bronchiectasis registry (EMBARC) found that AATD was uncommon in the patients included in this network [<xref rid=""bib13"" ref-type=""bibr"">13</xref>]. However, other studies have found a much higher incidence of AATD variants in patients with bronchiectasis not due to cystic fibrosis [<xref rid=""bib14"" ref-type=""bibr"">14</xref>,<xref rid=""bib15"" ref-type=""bibr"">15</xref>]. Conversely, as previously noted, when patients with known AATD in the European Alpha1 Research Collaboration (EARCO) registry were surveyed for bronchiectasis, 9.1 % were found to have bronchiectasis alone and 27 % were found to have bronchiectasis in the presence of emphysema [<xref rid=""bib8"" ref-type=""bibr"">8</xref>]. Based on these studies, current European Respiratory Society guidelines recommend AATD testing in patients that have bronchiectasis without evident etiology [<xref rid=""bib16"" ref-type=""bibr"">16</xref>]. Buck et al. reported beneficial effects of AAT augmentation therapy (decreased exacerbations) in a patient with bronchiectasis and frequent exacerbations [<xref rid=""bib17"" ref-type=""bibr"">17</xref>]. However, at present, there are no prospective, controlled studies supporting this possible method of treatment. In addition to this case report, only a few other studies report patients with bronchiectasis who were tested and found to have rare AAT variants [<xref rid=""bib18"" ref-type=""bibr"">[18]</xref>, <xref rid=""bib19"" ref-type=""bibr"">[19]</xref>, <xref rid=""bib20"" ref-type=""bibr"">[20]</xref>, <xref rid=""bib21"" ref-type=""bibr"">[21]</xref>]. Clearly additional research on the clinical characterization of rare AAT variants is needed. Based on currently available data it is advisable to test patients with COPD for AATD and to consider testing patients with bronchiectasis of unknown etiology. Patients with rare <italic toggle=""yes"">SERPINA1</italic> variants should be evaluated and treated individually based on their serum AAT levels and clinical symptoms. Patient education on AATD and possibly referral to a center with AATD expertise may help in making treatment decisions. Genetic testing of family members could help identify relatives with early stage disease who might benefit from therapeutic intervention and young individuals who have not developed symptoms and who could benefit from lifestyle interventions (e.g., smoking prevention or cessation).

To determine whether AT2s express AAT, we analyzed peripheral human lung tissue from a partially overlapping set of 15 donors by immunostaining for AAT and pro-SFTPC.

We found that in patients with ZZ-AATD, AT2s and alveolar macrophages differ transcriptomically from those in wild-type COPD and control participants without chronic lung disease. Differentially expressed genes that were upregulated in AT2s and alveolar macrophages in AATD were enriched for Hallmark gene sets associated with inflammatory signaling (“tumor necrosis factor α [TNFα] signaling via nuclear factor kappaB [NFkB]”, “IL-2/STAT5 Signaling”, “IL-6/JAK/STAT3 Signaling”) as well as the “Unfolded Protein Response” (<xref rid=""fig2"" ref-type=""fig"">Fig 2</xref>A-C, E-G).

AT2s and alveolar macrophages in ZZ-AATD exhibit a distinct transcriptomic signature, including inflammatory pathway and unfolded protein response gene set enrichment. AT2s in ZZ-AATD additionally exhibit evidence of cell stress such as ATF4 regulon enrichment and expression of cleaved caspase 3. Whether observed cellular toxicity results from intracellular polymerization of misfolded Z-AAT protein, as occurs in hepatocytes in AATD, remains to be established. Limitations of this study include the small number of samples from patients with AATD available for sequencing and a lack of tissue representative of earlier stages of disease for analysis. Additional studies will be necessary to identify underlying disease mechanisms responsible for activation of specific pathways within AAT-expressing cells as well as heterogeneity that could exist within the ZZ-AATD population.

Impact of Hypoxia on Neutrophil Degranulation and Inflammatory Response in Alpha-1 Antitrypsin Deficiency Patients,"Background: Alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency (AATD) is an inflammatory disorder where neutrophils play a key role. Excessive neutrophil activation leads to local hypoxia and tissue damage. Most research on neutrophil function has been conducted under atmospheric conditions (21% O<sub>2</sub>), which may not represent physiological or pathological conditions. This study aimed to determine the effects of hypoxia on neutrophil degranulation and cytokine production in AATD patients. Methods: Neutrophils isolated from 54 AATD patients (31 MZ; 8 SZ; 15 ZZ) and 7 controls (MM) were exposed to hypoxia (1% O<sub>2</sub>) for 4 h. Neutrophil degranulation was assessed by measuring elastase (NE), myeloperoxidase (MPO), lactoferrin, and matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) levels using immunoassay-based methods. Pro-inflammatory (IL-8, IL-1 beta, IL-6, and TNF-alpha) and anti-inflammatory (IL-4 and IL-10) cytokine levels were assessed by a Luminex-based method. Results: Our results indicate a significantly increased release of NE (<italic toggle=""yes"">p</italic> = 0.015), MPO (<italic toggle=""yes"">p</italic> = 0.042), lactoferrin (<italic toggle=""yes"">p</italic> = 0.015), and MMP-9 (<italic toggle=""yes"">p</italic> = 0.001) compared to controls. Pro-inflammatory cytokines show a significant rise in IL-8 (<italic toggle=""yes"">p</italic> = 0.019), a trend towards increased IL-1 beta (<italic toggle=""yes"">p</italic> = 0.3196), no change in IL-6 (<italic toggle=""yes"">p</italic> = 0.7329), and reduced TNF-alpha (<italic toggle=""yes"">p</italic> = 0.006). Anti-inflammatory cytokines show increased IL-4 (<italic toggle=""yes"">p</italic> = 0.057) and decreased IL-10 (<italic toggle=""yes"">p</italic> = 0.05703). Conclusions: Increased neutrophil degranulation and inflammatory phenotype are observed in AATD neutrophils under physiological hypoxia.","Alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency (AATD) is a rare inherited disease characterized by decreased plasma levels of alpha-1 antitrypsin (AAT), a serine protease inhibitor glycoprotein synthesized and secreted mainly by hepatocytes (and to a lesser extent by monocytes, macrophages, and pulmonary epithelial cells). AAT’s main function is to protect the lungs from damage caused by neutrophils’ proteolytic enzymes, including elastase (NE), cathepsin G, and proteinase 3. The SERPINA1 gene encodes AAT, and although more than 120 mutations have been described at this locus, the most common deficient variants are the S and Z forms (versus the normal M allele). These mutations lead to the misfolding of AAT, which polymerizes and accumulates in the endoplasmic reticulum of hepatocytes (and other producing cells), resulting in chronic inflammation in the liver and leading, in some patients, to the development of severe liver disease (cirrhosis and liver cancer). As a consequence, patients with AATD have low plasma AAT levels, resulting in a reduced ability to inhibit NE and leading to lung parenchymal destruction and the development of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). This situation is exacerbated by smoking and repeated and prolonged exposure to dust and smoke in occupational settings and polluting environments. At the pulmonary level, AATD patients’ most frequent clinical manifestation is panacinar emphysema [<xref rid=""B1-antioxidants-13-01071"" ref-type=""bibr"">1</xref>]. In addition to the antiprotease activity, AAT has anti-inflammatory and immune-regulatory properties. AATD is increasingly considered an inflammatory disorder in which neutrophils play a key role in the inflammation associated with the pathology. Neutrophil activation increases their capacity to damage nearby tissues through protease, reactive oxygen species (ROS), and pro-inflammatory cytokine release [<xref rid=""B2-antioxidants-13-01071"" ref-type=""bibr"">2</xref>,<xref rid=""B3-antioxidants-13-01071"" ref-type=""bibr"">3</xref>]. Several studies have shown considerable interaction between the molecular pathways that regulate hypoxia and inflammation, so tissue hypoxia is considered part of the normal inflammatory process. Neutrophils are generated within hypoxic tissue such as the bone marrow, are exposed to intermittent hypoxia in the circulation, and are recruited to sites of infection and inflammation, which are often highly hypoxic. Despite this, most knowledge of neutrophil signaling and function derives from studies performed under atmospheric oxygen conditions (21% O<sub>2</sub>), which do not reflect the physiological or pathological setting in vivo [<xref rid=""B4-antioxidants-13-01071"" ref-type=""bibr"">4</xref>,<xref rid=""B5-antioxidants-13-01071"" ref-type=""bibr"">5</xref>,<xref rid=""B6-antioxidants-13-01071"" ref-type=""bibr"">6</xref>,<xref rid=""B7-antioxidants-13-01071"" ref-type=""bibr"">7</xref>,<xref rid=""B8-antioxidants-13-01071"" ref-type=""bibr"">8</xref>]. Therefore, this study aimed to investigate the impact of hypoxia on neutrophil degranulation and cytokine profile in AATD patients. We hypothesized that, compared to normal individuals, hypoxia would activate neutrophils in AATD patients.   Numerous studies have shown that neutrophils have a role in the pathophysiology of several inflammatory pulmonary illnesses associated with tissue hypoxia, including COPD [<xref rid=""B9-antioxidants-13-01071"" ref-type=""bibr"">9</xref>], bronchiectasis [<xref rid=""B6-antioxidants-13-01071"" ref-type=""bibr"">6</xref>], cystic fibrosis [<xref rid=""B10-antioxidants-13-01071"" ref-type=""bibr"">10</xref>], neutrophilic asthma [<xref rid=""B6-antioxidants-13-01071"" ref-type=""bibr"">6</xref>], and AATD [<xref rid=""B11-antioxidants-13-01071"" ref-type=""bibr"">11</xref>,<xref rid=""B12-antioxidants-13-01071"" ref-type=""bibr"">12</xref>]. Neutrophils’ level of activation has an impact on their capacity to damage nearby tissues. Excessive or unchecked neutrophil activation results in their degranulation and the release of proteolytic enzymes, whose accumulation in the extracellular space causes significant damage to nearby tissues [<xref rid=""B6-antioxidants-13-01071"" ref-type=""bibr"">6</xref>,<xref rid=""B13-antioxidants-13-01071"" ref-type=""bibr"">13</xref>]. It is now understood that neutrophils have the capacity to generate a range of mediators that have a significant impact on airways. These include proteases like matrix metalloproteinases, which can degrade the extracellular matrix (e.g., MMP-9, collagenase, and elastase). Through the enzyme myeloperoxidase, which catalyzes the creation of hypochlorous acid (HOCl), neutrophils are able to release harmful oxygen radicals. Neutrophils are also a source of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as TNF-α, interleukin-1, IL-6, IL-8, and Leukotriene B4 [<xref rid=""B6-antioxidants-13-01071"" ref-type=""bibr"">6</xref>,<xref rid=""B13-antioxidants-13-01071"" ref-type=""bibr"">13</xref>]. On the other hand, activated neutrophils consume more O<sub>2</sub>, resulting in local hypoxia, ROS production, and oxidative damage in the affected tissues [<xref rid=""B10-antioxidants-13-01071"" ref-type=""bibr"">10</xref>,<xref rid=""B14-antioxidants-13-01071"" ref-type=""bibr"">14</xref>,<xref rid=""B15-antioxidants-13-01071"" ref-type=""bibr"">15</xref>,<xref rid=""B16-antioxidants-13-01071"" ref-type=""bibr"">16</xref>]. However, the precise mechanisms by which neutrophils mediate tissue injury under hypoxic environments still need to be discovered [<xref rid=""B6-antioxidants-13-01071"" ref-type=""bibr"">6</xref>]. Neutrophils have evolved cellular and molecular mechanisms that allow them to function effectively at low oxygen levels. Under physiological conditions, circulating neutrophils are exposed to a wide range of oxygen availability, from a pO<sub>2</sub> of 13 kPa in the main arteries to 3 kPa in capillaries and venules (physiological hypoxia). Under homeostatic conditions, neutrophils are short half-life cells that easily undergo apoptosis to avoid degranulation and release of proteinases and consequent cell damage [<xref rid=""B13-antioxidants-13-01071"" ref-type=""bibr"">13</xref>]. However, under hypoxic conditions, neutrophil survival is significantly prolonged, which is thought to delay the resolution of inflammation and promote tissue damage, potentially through the release of proteases and ROS [<xref rid=""B13-antioxidants-13-01071"" ref-type=""bibr"">13</xref>,<xref rid=""B17-antioxidants-13-01071"" ref-type=""bibr"">17</xref>,<xref rid=""B18-antioxidants-13-01071"" ref-type=""bibr"">18</xref>]. Importantly, several studies have shown that the number of neutrophils in the lungs of AATD patients is significantly higher than those of healthy individuals, which could contribute to increased proteolytic and inflammation-hypoxia activity and the development of COPD (emphysema) observed in these patients [<xref rid=""B3-antioxidants-13-01071"" ref-type=""bibr"">3</xref>]. However, previous studies on AATD neutrophils have been performed under atmospheric oxygen conditions (21% O<sub>2</sub>), which may not reflect physiological or pathological conditions [<xref rid=""B7-antioxidants-13-01071"" ref-type=""bibr"">7</xref>,<xref rid=""B8-antioxidants-13-01071"" ref-type=""bibr"">8</xref>,<xref rid=""B13-antioxidants-13-01071"" ref-type=""bibr"">13</xref>]. In our study, increased neutrophil degradation in AATD patients was observed in hypoxia. Neutrophils from AATD patients, incubated under hypoxia for 4 h and stimulated with TNF-alpha and fMLP, showed significantly increased release of active NE (azurophil granules; <italic toggle=""yes"">p</italic> = 0.035) (<xref rid=""antioxidants-13-01071-f001"" ref-type=""fig"">Figure 1</xref>A), MPO (azurophil granules; <italic toggle=""yes"">p</italic> = 0.042) (<xref rid=""antioxidants-13-01071-f001"" ref-type=""fig"">Figure 1</xref>B), lactoferrin (specific granules; <italic toggle=""yes"">p</italic> = 0.015) (<xref rid=""antioxidants-13-01071-f001"" ref-type=""fig"">Figure 1</xref>C), and MMP-9 (gelatinase granules; <italic toggle=""yes"">p</italic> = 0.001) (<xref rid=""antioxidants-13-01071-f001"" ref-type=""fig"">Figure 1</xref>D) compared to control individuals (MM). When patients were compared to each other, a trend associated with phenotypic risk (ZZ > SZ > MZ) was observed that did not reach statistical significance, mainly as a result of the low sample size (see the limitations of this study below). In all cases, neutrophils from ZZ-AATD patients with a higher phenotypic risk of developing lung and liver disease showed, under hypoxic conditions, a significantly increased degranulation compared to the control group, except in the case of lactoferrin, where an increase associated with phenotype risk that does not reach statistical significance is observed. The relationship between hypoxia and the regulation of neutrophil degranulation has been shown previously in neutrophils isolated from healthy volunteers incubated under hypoxic conditions [<xref rid=""B6-antioxidants-13-01071"" ref-type=""bibr"">6</xref>]. Previous studies demonstrated that neutrophils isolated from healthy volunteers after hypoxemia showed increased NE release [<xref rid=""B13-antioxidants-13-01071"" ref-type=""bibr"">13</xref>,<xref rid=""B19-antioxidants-13-01071"" ref-type=""bibr"">19</xref>]. A later study revealed that neutrophils from healthy volunteers exposed to ex vivo hypoxia (3 kPA for 1–4 h) released elevated levels of NE [<xref rid=""B13-antioxidants-13-01071"" ref-type=""bibr"">13</xref>,<xref rid=""B20-antioxidants-13-01071"" ref-type=""bibr"">20</xref>]. A recent study has shown that neutrophils isolated from healthy volunteers cultured under hypoxic conditions (0.8% O<sub>2</sub>, 3 kPa for 4 h) released significantly higher levels of NE, MPO, lactoferrin, and MMP-9, indicating increased neutrophil degranulation. The same study observed that the supernatant from neutrophils cultured under hypoxic conditions induced airway epithelial cell death. This situation did not occur when cells were cultured with the supernatant from neutrophils cultured under normoxia. Subsequently, these researchers observed that co-incubation with AAT significantly reduced cell death, suggesting that NE was involved in cell damage [<xref rid=""B9-antioxidants-13-01071"" ref-type=""bibr"">9</xref>]. Finally, a previous study has shown that neutrophils isolated from AATD patients with decreased lung function (FEV1 < 80%), incubated under atmospheric O<sub>2</sub> conditions (21% O<sub>2</sub>) and stimulated with TNF-alpha and fMLP, showed a greater release of MPO than healthy individuals [<xref rid=""B21-antioxidants-13-01071"" ref-type=""bibr"">21</xref>]. Our results agree with those previously published in which hypoxia was shown to induce the degranulation of neutrophils isolated from healthy volunteers. The increased production and release of neutrophilic proteases into the cellular environment suggests an increased ability to damage surrounding tissues [<xref rid=""B15-antioxidants-13-01071"" ref-type=""bibr"">15</xref>]. However, this aspect has not been explored in the present study. In our study, we have also evaluated the role of hypoxia in the production of a group of pro-inflammatory (IL-6, IL-8, IL-1 beta, and TNF-alpha) and anti-inflammatory (IL-4 and IL-10) cytokines to determine if hypoxia induces significant changes in cytokine production that could contribute to improving our understanding of the clinical phenotype and progression of the disease. Our results show a statistically significant increase in IL-8 (<italic toggle=""yes"">p</italic> = 0.019) and a trend to increase in IL-1 beta (<italic toggle=""yes"">p</italic> = 0.3196). Increased IL-8 in AATD can result in excessive accumulation of neutrophils in the lungs, which increases the release of elastases and other inflammatory mediators that contribute to alveolar damage and the development of emphysema [<xref rid=""B3-antioxidants-13-01071"" ref-type=""bibr"">3</xref>]. IL-1β is involved in acute and chronic inflammatory processes. Its elevation in AATD patients suggests a continuous activation of inflammation, which may accelerate lung tissue degradation and exacerbate AATD-associated COPD [<xref rid=""B3-antioxidants-13-01071"" ref-type=""bibr"">3</xref>]. Our results show no significant changes in the levels of IL-6 (<italic toggle=""yes"">p</italic> = 0.7329). This pro-inflammatory cytokine plays a very important role in the immune response and the regulation of systemic inflammation [<xref rid=""B3-antioxidants-13-01071"" ref-type=""bibr"">3</xref>]. In this case, we would expect an increase in IL-6 levels that could indicate a chronic inflammatory response that would contribute to lung and liver damage and could be involved in the development of liver fibrosis observed in some patients. In our case, the unchanging levels in patients with AATD could indicate a different regulatory mechanism or inflammatory response stage than IL-8 and IL-1β. IL-6 also has roles in the immune response and in promoting inflammation. Still, its stability suggests that other factors may be more directly involved in these patients’ active pathogenesis of AATD. Our results also show decreased TNF-alpha, a pro-inflammatory cytokine with complex roles in inflammation and apoptosis [<xref rid=""B3-antioxidants-13-01071"" ref-type=""bibr"">3</xref>]. Interestingly, in our study, this cytokine decreases under hypoxia conditions in patients with AATD. Although we do not have an explanation for this decrease, the unexpected reduction in TNF-alpha in AATD may reflect an attempt by the body to modulate excessive inflammation and may also imply a failure of effective immune response against infections. Several studies have shown that hypoxia can reduce the release of TNF-alpha. Research indicates that chronic hypoxia can inhibit the up-regulation of TNF-alpha-induced monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1) expression in human proximal renal tubular cells, suggesting that hypoxia has a regulatory effect on inflammatory responses by decreasing TNF-alpha activity [<xref rid=""B22-antioxidants-13-01071"" ref-type=""bibr"">22</xref>]. Another study found that hypoxia modulates the immune response by reducing the secretion of TNF-alpha, leading to lower NF-κB signaling and MCP-1 secretion in human adipocytes, further supporting the anti-inflammatory role of hypoxia in certain conditions [<xref rid=""B23-antioxidants-13-01071"" ref-type=""bibr"">23</xref>]. These findings emphasize hypoxia’s potential to reduce inflammation by inhibiting TNF-alpha-related pathways. Concerning anti-inflammatory cytokines, our results indicate a decrease in IL-10 and an increase in IL-4. IL-10 is an anti-inflammatory cytokine crucial in limiting the inflammatory response and preventing excessive tissue damage. Reducing IL-10 AATD may exacerbate inflammation and tissue damage by not adequately counteracting pro-inflammatory cytokines. This could contribute to the rapid progression of lung and liver disease in these patients. On the other hand, IL-4 is a cytokine associated with humoral immune response and Th2 cell activation. An increase in IL-4 in AATD may indicate a shift toward a Th2-type immune response, which is less effective in dealing with infections and more prone to chronic inflammation and fibrosis. This shift may aggravate lung and liver problems, promoting a chronic inflammatory environment. Overall, our results indicate that the cytokine profile in AATD patients fits within an unbalanced inflammatory environment. Increased pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-8 and IL-1β suggest chronic active inflammation contributing to tissue damage. Decreased TNF-alpha and IL-10 indicate inadequate regulation of inflammation, which may result in ongoing damage and a compromised immune response. In contrast, increased IL-4 signals a possible shift toward a Th2-type immune response, which may not be beneficial in the context of AATD, as it may promote fibrosis and exacerbate inflammation. Previous studies have shown that the involvement of cytokines in AATD is complex and involves both pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory cytokines. In AATD, the inflammatory response is increased due to the lack of AAT’s protective effects [<xref rid=""B24-antioxidants-13-01071"" ref-type=""bibr"">24</xref>]. Several studies have highlighted the elevated levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines in AATD patients [<xref rid=""B3-antioxidants-13-01071"" ref-type=""bibr"">3</xref>]. Elevated IL-8 levels in AATD patients have been associated with increased neutrophil infiltration and subsequent lung tissue damage. The recruitment of neutrophils exacerbates the release of NE, fostering the cycle of inflammation and tissue destruction [<xref rid=""B25-antioxidants-13-01071"" ref-type=""bibr"">25</xref>,<xref rid=""B26-antioxidants-13-01071"" ref-type=""bibr"">26</xref>,<xref rid=""B27-antioxidants-13-01071"" ref-type=""bibr"">27</xref>]. IL-1 beta shows increased levels in AATD patients, which contributes to activating inflammatory pathways and promoting cytokine cascades. IL-1β induces the expression of adhesion molecules and other cytokines, perpetuating the inflammatory state and contributing to tissue damage [<xref rid=""B28-antioxidants-13-01071"" ref-type=""bibr"">28</xref>]. Several studies have shown increased TNF-alpha production in AATD, showing that lack of AAT results in increased TNF-alpha production and augmented neutrophil degranulation [<xref rid=""B3-antioxidants-13-01071"" ref-type=""bibr"">3</xref>]. Our results do not agree with those of other studies. Contrary to expected, a reduction in TNF-alpha production is observed, which might reflect a compensatory mechanism that attempts to control chronic inflammation. However, the decreased TNF-alpha may also indicate an impaired immune response, unable to regulate the tissue damage observed in AATD [<xref rid=""B22-antioxidants-13-01071"" ref-type=""bibr"">22</xref>,<xref rid=""B23-antioxidants-13-01071"" ref-type=""bibr"">23</xref>]. So far, we do not have an explanation for these results, and they deserve further research. A major limitation of our study is the low number of patients with SZ and ZZ phenotypes included, which is not surprising given the low prevalence of these phenotypes. This may be why some of the results (particularly those related to the study of cytokines) do not reach statistical significance, even though a clear trend is observed in many cases. However, the significant differences observed in some of the studied degranulation markers indicate that their results should remain relatively constant after an increase in the sample size of the study groups mentioned above. For the same reason, possible sex/gender differences were not analyzed, limiting the results’ generalizability. One of the strengths of our study is that it has been performed on isolated neutrophils from clinically healthy AATD children. Respiratory function (assessed by spirometry performed in this study and previous X-ray and CT scans that revealed no signs of lung damage) and liver enzyme makers were normal in all patients included in this study. Since (at least in theory) children do not consume tobacco or alcohol, the bias introduced by these factors can be avoided, so the results obtained can be attributable to AATD and not to the influence of confounding factors. This is the first time that the role of hypoxia in neutrophil degranulation and cytokine production in AATD patients has been investigated. Since hypoxia is a crucial component of the pathophysiology of many illnesses, including COPD, heart failure, sleep apnea syndrome, and cancer, basic research into hypoxia can uncover processes that could be used to develop new therapeutic strategies [<xref rid=""B6-antioxidants-13-01071"" ref-type=""bibr"">6</xref>,<xref rid=""B15-antioxidants-13-01071"" ref-type=""bibr"">15</xref>]. In summary, the main contribution of this study to current knowledge on AATD neutrophil degranulation relies upon the effects of hypoxia and cytokine production, which confers a much more aggressive neutrophilic phenotype that could be related to the increased lung and liver damage observed in these patients. Our results show that the ability of ZZ-AAT neutrophils to release the protease content of their granules to the extracellular matrix is increased compared to MM-healthy individuals, suggesting that ZZ-AATD neutrophils might have a greater capacity to damage adjacent tissues. Finally, we have shown an imbalance between pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory cytokines, which may contribute to chronic inflammation and tissue damage. Therefore, it is important to understand the role of cytokines in AATD since it may have therapeutic implications. Targeting specific cytokines to restore balance could mitigate inflammation and tissue damage [<xref rid=""B29-antioxidants-13-01071"" ref-type=""bibr"">29</xref>].",N/A,02 9 2024

Logistic regression was used to obtain the predictive probability of developing CEPH given the lab values. We then ran a ROC analysis on the predictive probability to determine the optimal sensitivity and specificity and a combination of sensitivity and specificity. Following this, we reverse-calculated using the logistic regression equation to determine the lab values that gave us the predictive value associated with sensitivity, specificity, and the combination values.  Homozygous ZZ AAT deficiency is a common genetic disease identified in infants with liver disease but is widely underdiagnosed and misdiagnosed in adults. This is partly the result of the very wide range of potential presentations throughout all ages of life. Although equally as frequent as cystic fibrosis and many other genetic diseases, AAT deficiency is not on the newborn screen in any country or US state. The most common presentation in childhood is neonatal cholestatic hepatitis, but it has been impossible to predict which of the infants who are diagnosed after presenting with this syndrome will do well and which will go on to CEPH, liver transplant, or death.<xref rid=""bib6"" ref-type=""bibr""><sup>6</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid=""bib13"" ref-type=""bibr""><sup>13</sup></xref> It is also known that there is a risk of CEPH in childhood, even without preceding neonatal cholestasis, but this also cannot be predicted. These data provide a biomarker and algorithm useful in identifying a group of ZZ children at high risk of severe liver disease. We not only show how the clinically obtained GGT level might be used but also show the potential utility of the circulating polymer measurement. Further study, as more participants are enrolled and followed in this cohort will allow further refinement. The majority of these participants were treated with ursodeoxycholic acid at some point in their care, as part of local standard of care, but not in a controlled way. Currently, we are not able to assess the impact of any specific standard of care intervention on serum polymer. Our findings are critically important and timely. In recent years, there has been a burst of activity in the development of new therapies for the liver disease of AAT deficiency, including siRNA strategies to knock down expression of the toxic protein and studies of the potential role of small molecules to improve folding, reduce accumulation, and increase secretion.<xref rid=""bib17"" ref-type=""bibr""><sup>17</sup></xref> While none are yet approved, many clinical trials are newly opened and enrolling liver-affected ZZ individuals. At present, these newly enrolling studies are limited to enrolling adults and studying adult outcomes. Older ZZ adults have a greater risk of cirrhosis, perhaps as high as 40% lifetime risk, than children, which may have a 3% to 5% overall cirrhosis risk in childhood, and 15% of those with neonatal cholestasis. These data will allow identification of a group of infants at high risk of severe disease soon after diagnosis. Enrollment of children into trials can then be focused on this high-risk group, sparing many participants from needless trials and speeding the effective treatments to proof of efficacy and approval. Studies are also now underway comparing the liver burden of Z polymer to the serum level and to clinical outcomes. This will be another important question to examine. While exciting and, for this disease, likely a critical finding, this report leaves a major question unanswered. What is the role of Z protein polymer in the circulation, and what can that teach us about disease pathophysiology or normal physiology? Our previous work has shown that there is secretion of these small quantities of Z polymer from hepatocytes. However, could small amounts of Z polymer also be leaking out of dying hepatocytes nonspecifically, and if so, how is this important<xref rid=""bib2"" ref-type=""bibr""><sup>2</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid=""bib9"" ref-type=""bibr""><sup>9</sup></xref>? It is well documented that Z polymer can be found in the lungs and other tissues of ZZ individuals. Previous studies demonstrate that extracellular polymer has pro-inflammatory properties, such as stimulating neutrophil chemotaxis, and polymers have also been implicated as part of the pathophysiology of lung injury in this disease.<xref rid=""bib18"" ref-type=""bibr""><sup>18</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid=""bib19"" ref-type=""bibr""><sup>19</sup></xref> These data are further limited by the lack of a currently available, Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendment approved assay for serum polymer. It is currently a test only available for research. The other major limitation of this work is the fairly low number of “events” (development of CEPH) during the observation period. While we have a large data set of existing CEPH compared to no CEPH, it is the prospective data collection before the CEPH develops that is most useful in developing predictive associations from baseline data. We will continue to gather data, and we intend to repeat this analysis over time, but at current rates, this is likely to take several years. However, with the power of these data, this report will be important in stimulating additional study of these findings. AAT liver disease has no treatment and no cure at the present time. These newly identified markers associated with a high-risk group of infants will stimulate and accelerate human trials and likely bring nearer the day when there are no more liver transplants required for AAT deficiency.",N/A,26 4 2024
Alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency and Pi*Z allele as important co-factors in the development of liver fibrosis,,"Alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency (AATD) is one of the most common genetic diseases, a codominant autosomal hereditary condition, caused by pathogenic mutations in SERPINA1[<xref rid=""B1"" ref-type=""bibr"">1</xref>,<xref rid=""B2"" ref-type=""bibr"">2</xref>]. This condition results in decreased circulating levels of AAT and predisposes patients to the development of lung and/or liver disease[<xref rid=""B1"" ref-type=""bibr"">1</xref>,<xref rid=""B2"" ref-type=""bibr"">2</xref>]. AAT is mainly synthesized in the hepatocytes, within the endoplasmic reticulum and secreted through the Golgi apparatus into the circulation[<xref rid=""B1"" ref-type=""bibr"">1</xref>]. In patients with severe deficiency alleles, approximately 70% of the mutated AAT is degraded in the endoplasmic reticulum, 15% is secreted, and 15% persists within the endoplasmic reticulum as inclusions, which are positive on periodic acid-Schiff staining and are the histologic hallmark of the disease[<xref rid=""B3"" ref-type=""bibr"">3</xref>,<xref rid=""B4"" ref-type=""bibr"">4</xref>]. Thus, the liver retention of misfolded AAT leads to endoplasmic reticulum stress and mitochondrial dysfunction, which results in liver disease in a “gain of function” mechanism[<xref rid=""B1"" ref-type=""bibr"">1</xref>,<xref rid=""B5"" ref-type=""bibr"">5</xref>,<xref rid=""B6"" ref-type=""bibr"">6</xref>]. AAT is an important circulating proteinase inhibitor, protecting lung tissue against attack by the enzyme neutrophil elastase, which degrades elastin and connective tissue in the lungs[<xref rid=""B7"" ref-type=""bibr"">7</xref>]. Low plasma AAT levels, seen in severe deficiencies, are associated with a markedly increased risk of early-onset emphysema, through a “loss of function” mechanism, especially when associated with exposure to cigarette smoke, environment irritants, or infections[<xref rid=""B1"" ref-type=""bibr"">1</xref>,<xref rid=""B2"" ref-type=""bibr"">2</xref>]. The wild-type allele of SERPINA1 which encodes AAT is the Pi*M[<xref rid=""B1"" ref-type=""bibr"">1</xref>]. Although more than 100 SERPINA1 variants have been identified, the Pi*Z allele being the most clinically relevant mutation[<xref rid=""B8"" ref-type=""bibr"">8</xref>]. Pi*Z homozygotes have the highest risk of prominent disease and heterozygotes have a clear predisposition but low absolute risk for the development of relevant lung or liver disease[<xref rid=""B8"" ref-type=""bibr"">8</xref>,<xref rid=""B9"" ref-type=""bibr"">9</xref>]. The Pi*S allele is also clinically significant, although patients with Pi*SZ are less likely to develop lung disease than Pi*Z homozygotes[<xref rid=""B10"" ref-type=""bibr"">10</xref>] and the Pi*S allele confers only a weak risk of liver disease in patients with excessive alcohol intake[<xref rid=""B11"" ref-type=""bibr"">11</xref>]. The Pi*ZZ phenotype although rare, is sufficient to cause end-stage liver disease, while the Pi*MZ phenotype is more common and considered a disease modifying factor in patients with other comorbidities, such as cystic fibrosis, alcoholic liver disease, and metabolic associated fatty liver disease[<xref rid=""B1"" ref-type=""bibr"">1</xref>,<xref rid=""B11"" ref-type=""bibr"">11</xref>,<xref rid=""B12"" ref-type=""bibr"">12</xref>]. Therefore, patients with AATD should be monitored for liver disease, using non-invasive methods[<xref rid=""B1"" ref-type=""bibr"">1</xref>]. Serum liver scores, such as nonalcoholic fatty liver disease fibrosis score (NFS) and fibrosis-4 index (FIB-4), are clinical scores validated for excluding advanced liver fibrosis[<xref rid=""B13"" ref-type=""bibr"">13</xref>-<xref rid=""B15"" ref-type=""bibr"">15</xref>], with FIB-4 index having better diagnostic accuracy for estimation of liver fibrosis among various serum markers[<xref rid=""B16"" ref-type=""bibr"">16</xref>]. Transient elastography (TE) is also useful for excluding significant liver fibrosis. The use of non-invasive tests for monitoring has been evaluated in various liver diseases, including alcoholic liver disease, non-alcoholic liver disease and infectious hepatitis[<xref rid=""B17"" ref-type=""bibr"">17</xref>]. However, studies about the non-invasive assessment and surveillance of AATD are lacking. Abbas <italic toggle=""yes"">et al</italic>[<xref rid=""B18"" ref-type=""bibr"">18</xref>] established a weak but statistically significant correlation between the FIB-4 index and liver stiffness measurement (LSM), with FIB-4 > 1.26 corresponding to LSM > 6 kilopascals (kPa). Generally, the LSM cut-offs used are > 7.1 kPa as suggestive of significant fibrosis, and > 10.0 kPa suggestive of advanced fibrosis[<xref rid=""B19"" ref-type=""bibr"">19</xref>,<xref rid=""B20"" ref-type=""bibr"">20</xref>]. One study compared LSM with histology in patients with AATD and established lower cut-offs, 5.45 kPa for significant fibrosis and 8.45 kPa for advanced fibrosis, both with a high negative predictive value, but low positive predictive value[<xref rid=""B5"" ref-type=""bibr"">5</xref>]. Therefore, the higher cut-offs had a higher positive predictive value compared to the lower cut-offs described in that study and are still the most frequently used[<xref rid=""B5"" ref-type=""bibr"">5</xref>,<xref rid=""B20"" ref-type=""bibr"">20</xref>]. The aim of this study was to evaluate the impact of demographic, anthropometric, and clinical parameters, including the patients’ comorbidities, and AATD phenotypes, particularly the Pi*Z allele, in liver fibrosis.   Our study identified 27.5% of patients with AATD, regardless of the phenotype, as having significant fibrosis through serum liver scores, namely NFS and FIB-4. In evaluation <italic toggle=""yes"">via</italic> TE, a LSM suggesting significant fibrosis occurred in 10.8% of our patients with AATD, regardless of the phenotype. In previous studies, clinically significant liver fibrosis, through non-invasive assessment, is present in 20%-35% of adults with AATD[<xref rid=""B5"" ref-type=""bibr"">5</xref>,<xref rid=""B20"" ref-type=""bibr"">20</xref>]. Patients with NFS that does not exclude advanced fibrosis and a FIB-4 indicative of moderate to advanced fibrosis had a significant higher age and a significant higher age at diagnosis, mainly in those with 41 or more years of age at diagnosis. Increasing age is associated with an increased risk of liver fibrosis, considering it is a genetic disease and the duration of the exposure of hepatocytes to the misfolded AAT increases with age[<xref rid=""B20"" ref-type=""bibr"">20</xref>], which is also associated with increased proteotoxic stress and decreased autophagic capacity[<xref rid=""B26"" ref-type=""bibr"">26</xref>,<xref rid=""B27"" ref-type=""bibr"">27</xref>]. Age younger than 50 years has been associated with lower rates of significant liver fibrosis, especially in males[<xref rid=""B12"" ref-type=""bibr"">12</xref>,<xref rid=""B20"" ref-type=""bibr"">20</xref>,<xref rid=""B28"" ref-type=""bibr"">28</xref>,<xref rid=""B29"" ref-type=""bibr"">29</xref>], although no major impact was found in females[<xref rid=""B20"" ref-type=""bibr"">20</xref>]. AATD patients with hypertension, type 2 DM, dyslipidaemia, metabolic syndrome, and regular alcohol intake were more likely to have liver serum tests not excluding advanced fibrosis. In patients with at least one Pi*Z allele, the presence of DM was associated with a higher likelihood of significant liver fibrosis (≥ F2), which is not surprising since these are the main risk factors for chronic liver disease and their association with AATD is an important contributor for liver fibrosis. Risk factors for advanced liver fibrosis in AATD patients include male sex, metabolic syndrome, obesity, and type 2 DM, especially in patients with Pi*ZZ[<xref rid=""B1"" ref-type=""bibr"">1</xref>,<xref rid=""B5"" ref-type=""bibr"">5</xref>,<xref rid=""B12"" ref-type=""bibr"">12</xref>,<xref rid=""B20"" ref-type=""bibr"">20</xref>,<xref rid=""B29"" ref-type=""bibr"">29</xref>,<xref rid=""B30"" ref-type=""bibr"">30</xref>]. In fact, obesity is associated with liver fibrogenesis[<xref rid=""B31"" ref-type=""bibr"">31</xref>], and insulin resistance leads to an increase in lipolysis and thus increasing the endoplasmic reticulum stress of patients with AATD[<xref rid=""B32"" ref-type=""bibr"">32</xref>]. Obesity, insulin resistance, and type 2 DM are risk factors associated with LSM equal or superior to 7.1 kPa in patients with Pi*MZ phenotype[<xref rid=""B20"" ref-type=""bibr"">20</xref>,<xref rid=""B33"" ref-type=""bibr"">33</xref>]. In our cohort, an AAT value at diagnosis inferior to 77 mg/dL, measure by immunoturbidimetry, was able to predict a NFS value considered as not excluding advanced fibrosis. It is important to consider the method used for AAT measurement, since different methods are available and have different ranges of normal values and protective thresholds[<xref rid=""B2"" ref-type=""bibr"">2</xref>]. For instance, in the method used in our institution, the normal values range between 150-200 and 350-400 mg/dL, with a protective threshold of 80 mg/dL, while, in nephelometry, the normal values range between 83-120 and 200-220 mg/dL, with a protective threshold of 57 mg/dL, and, in purified standard tests, the normal values are 20-53 μmol/L, with a protective threshold of 11 μmol/L[<xref rid=""B2"" ref-type=""bibr"">2</xref>]. In fact, previous studies have demonstrated that higher serum levels of AAT in PI*ZZ individuals are significantly and independently associated with better FEV1, with a strong relationship between lower levels of AAT and lung parenchymal disease[<xref rid=""B34"" ref-type=""bibr"">34</xref>]. There was no statistically significant association between AAT phenotypes and a NFS not excluding advanced fibrosis, a FIB-4 indicative of moderate to advanced fibrosis or a LSM value equal or superior to 7.1 kPa. It has been established that the Pi*MZ phenotype is disease-modifying, a risk factor for the development of liver disease, in the presence of other liver diseases[<xref rid=""B12"" ref-type=""bibr"">12</xref>,<xref rid=""B20"" ref-type=""bibr"">20</xref>,<xref rid=""B29"" ref-type=""bibr"">29</xref>]. In fact, Pi*ZZ patients are 20 times more likely to develop liver fibrosis and cirrhosis and Pi*SZ have a 3 times higher risk, compared to non-carriers, while Pi*MZ individuals have a lower increased odds ratio for liver fibrosis[<xref rid=""B33"" ref-type=""bibr"">33</xref>]. These differences between our cohort and previous studies can be explained by the disproportion of patients with Pi*MZ and Pi*ZZ phenotypes, and the small patient sample. In our cohort, no statistically significant association was found between FEV1 and DLCO and a NFS not excluding advanced fibrosis, a FIB-4 indicative of moderate to advanced fibrosis or a LSM value equal or superior to 7.1 kPa. There is controversy regarding the correlation between the severity of lung and liver involvement, with several studies not identifying a statistically significant association between lung function parameters and liver disease, confirming the current model of two different and independent pathogenic mechanisms[<xref rid=""B5"" ref-type=""bibr"">5</xref>,<xref rid=""B20"" ref-type=""bibr"">20</xref>]. However, another study, with 10% of patients with chronic liver disease, 7% liver cirrhosis, and 2% hepatocellular carcinoma, has found that lung function is poorer in those with liver disease, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease was more common in patients with liver disease[<xref rid=""B28"" ref-type=""bibr"">28</xref>]. The differences between this study and our results can be due to the low prevalence of liver fibrosis in our sample. More recently, it was reported that patients with predominant impairment in diffusion capacity also have signs of liver involvement, with higher FIB-4 values, lower platelet levels and higher percentage of individuals with diagnosed liver disease[<xref rid=""B34"" ref-type=""bibr"">34</xref>]. Using the associations found in our cohort, we developed an algorithm for the screening of liver disease in patients with AATD (Figure <xref rid=""F3"" ref-type=""fig"">3</xref>). AATD patients and one additional risk factor for liver fibrosis should be monitored and their NFS and FIB-4 calculated. Those with a NFS not excluding advanced fibrosis and/or a FIB-4 indicative of moderate to advanced fibrosis must be referred to TE for LSM evaluation and Hepatology consultation. This algorithm can be a useful tool in primary care and Pulmonology consultation, stratifying patients with AATD at increased risk of liver fibrosis, allowing patient selection for referral to Hepatology consultation and emerging clinical trials in AATD liver therapies. Our study supports the increasing evidence that patients with AATD are at risk of developing liver disease in the presence of comorbid conditions, namely metabolic risk factors and regular alcohol consumption. Additional risk factors were identified, such as age equal or superior to 50 years, having at least one Pi*Z allele, an age at diagnosis equal or superior to 41 years, and an AAT value at diagnosis inferior to 77 mg/dL. Therefore, it is important to minimise coexisting factors in individuals with AATD phenotypes that confer an increased risk of liver fibrosis (Pi*MZ, Pi*ZZ and Pi*SZ). These patients should have a tight control of metabolic factors, with weight reduction, nutrition consultations, controlled blood pressure, dyslipidaemia and glycaemia, and reduction of alcohol consumption, be advised to lose weight and avoid alcohol use. Long-term, longitudinal, and prospective studies are crucial to monitor these patients and determine the rate of disease progression and the occurrence of complications of advanced chronic liver disease, such as cirrhosis and liver cancer, as well as the impact of the correction of metabolic factors in the progression of liver disease.",N/A,27 8 2024
Assessment and monitoring of lung disease in patients with severe alpha 1 antitrypsin deficiency: a european delphi consensus of the EARCO group,,"Alpha 1 Antitrypsin Deficiency (AATD) is a rare genetic disorder characterized by the production of defective Alpha 1 Antitrypsin (AAT) protein or the absence of AAT production, caused by variations in the <italic toggle=""yes"">SERPINA1</italic> gene [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR1"">1</xref>]. AATD is associated with many different genotypes [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR2"">2</xref>]; the Pi*ZZ and Pi*SZ genotypes affect approximately 1.5 million people worldwide [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR3"">3</xref>–<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR5"">5</xref>] and it is estimated that 120,000 people in Europe have the Pi*ZZ genotype [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR6"">6</xref>], which is associated with low levels of AAT and in which augmentation therapy (treatment with plasma-derived AAT) may be indicated. Furthermore, around 1/800 patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) in Europe are also affected by AATD [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR6"">6</xref>, <xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR7"">7</xref>]. However, severe AATD is a largely underdiagnosed condition with approximately only 15–30% of cases diagnosed in European countries [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR8"">8</xref>]. There are multiple complications and comorbidities associated with AATD that places a significant clinical burden on patients. These include COPD, emphysema, and bronchiectasis, as well as liver complications such as fibrosis and steatosis [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR9"">9</xref>]. Patients with AATD often experience a poor quality of life (QoL), while caregivers experience stress, anxiety, and loss of personal time [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR9"">9</xref>]. In addition to this, AATD is associated with high medical costs and healthcare resource utilization, notably when augmentation therapy is prescribed [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR9"">9</xref>]. This form of therapy with purified AAT is the only specific treatment for AATD and aims to increase patient survival, control symptoms, and prevent the progression of AATD-associated emphysema [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR10"">10</xref>, <xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR11"">11</xref>]. Effective management of severe AATD is crucial to reduce the burden placed on patients, caregivers, and hospital resources. As clinicians rarely encounter patients with AATD, physicians treating these patients rely heavily on published guidelines on how to assess, monitor, and treat patients. Multiple guidelines have been published on AATD and are derived from COPD management recommendations, thus there is no guidance on the assessment and follow up of severe AATD-specific respiratory disease. Additionally, there is substantial variation in recommendations regarding how to manage routine clinical issues [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR12"">12</xref>]. Conflicting information on how to manage AATD arises partly from the low prevalence and paucity of specific clinical trials, in addition to differences in regional prevalence, availability of augmentation therapy, and insurance environments [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR8"">8</xref>, <xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR12"">12</xref>]. Establishing a consensus of assessment and management guidelines specific to severe AATD is, therefore, essential to achieve standardized treatment pathways to improve patient outcomes and reduce disease burden. We particularly focus on the severe end of the AATD spectrum (i.e., patients with Pi*ZZ, Pi*ZNull, and Pi*NullNull genotypes) as these patients are the most compromised and have specific treatment options available to them, such as augmentation therapy. Those with intermediate forms of AATD, such as those with the Pi*MZ, Pi*SZ, and Pi*SS genotypes, have a different set of challenges, including a lack of data that justifies this treatment (since these patients are explicitly excluded from randomized controlled trials); however, the diagnosis pathway for these patients is clear and is outlined in the most recent set of European guidelines [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR1"">1</xref>]. For those with severe AATD, establishing a set of consensus guidelines specific to these patients is one of several missions of the European Reference Network for respiratory diseases (ERN-LUNG)—a network of European healthcare providers dedicated to ensuring and promoting excellence in care and research for the benefit of patients affected by rare respiratory diseases. The European Alpha-1 Research Collaboration (EARCO) is a pan-European network committed to promoting clinical research and education in AATD [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR13"">13</xref>, <xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR14"">14</xref>]. EARCO is an initiative of the European Respiratory Society (ERS) and was established to promote research, clinical care, and awareness of AATD in Europe. The core project of EARCO is the International AATD Registry, which is a collaboration open to all investigators from around the world caring for patients with AATD. The International AATD Registry was established in response to the unmet need for a global registry, more information regarding AATD comorbidities, the natural history of the disease, and risk factors for disease progression and poor prognosis of lung disease [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR13"">13</xref>, <xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR14"">14</xref>]. In this current study, we utilized the experience of EARCO members to help build a European consensus for managing patients with severe AATD via a Delphi study. The Delphi method is a validated tool for developing a consensus of expert opinion where there is too little, too much, or conflicting information, and it can be adapted to suit specific situations [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR15"">15</xref>]. Here, the Delphi method was used to build a consensus for the optimal assessment, monitoring, and management of patients with severe AATD, leveraging its effectiveness in addressing complexity and uncertainty present in the field compared to other decision-making techniques [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR16"">16</xref>]. Members of EARCO were invited to participate in this Delphi study based on their expertise and experience in treating patients with AATD. The Delphi survey was conducted online, and respondents were asked to consider the initial assessment and routine follow-up/management of adults diagnosed with AATD and lung disease for those with:<list list-type=""simple""><list-item><label>A)</label><p id=""Par36"">No respiratory symptoms and stable lung function with normal age-related deterioration in spirometry over time (< 50 mL/year decline in forced expiratory volume in 1 s [FEV<sub>1</sub>])</p></list-item><list-item><label>B)</label><p id=""Par37"">Stable respiratory disease, with < 50 mL/year FEV<sub>1</sub> decline and at least one of: mild-to-moderate dyspnoea, or, 1–2 exacerbations/year requiring oral corticosteroids and/or antibiotics (not requiring hospitalization)</p></list-item><list-item><label>C)</label><p id=""Par38"">Worsening respiratory disease, with one or more of: moderate-to-severe dyspnoea, 1–2 exacerbations/year requiring hospitalization, or a FEV<sub>1</sub> decline of ≥ 50 mL/year</p></list-item></list> Respondents were asked to indicate how much they agreed with proposed statements using a Likert scale of 1–7 (where 1 was strongly disagree; 7 was strongly agree). Round 1 was sent to EARCO members via email in February 2022 and consisted of 109 questions on the following topics: spirometry, body plethysmography (body box), diffusion capacity, arterial blood gases, fractional exhaled nitric oxide (FeNO), oxygen saturation, high-resolution computed tomography (HRCT), low-dose computed tomography (LDCT), chest x-ray, QoL assessment, 6-min walking distance (6MWD), Medical Research Council (MRC) dyspnoea score, cardiopulmonary exercise test, exacerbation diary cards, liver tests, other monitoring/interventions and smoking status, and initiation of augmentation therapy. Responses were calculated using a weighted average to determine the level of agreement between respondents for each statement. Weighted averages were calculated by multiplying each response option (1–7) for a given statement by its frequency (the number of times it was chosen), summing these products, and then dividing this sum by the total number of responses provided. Weighted average thresholds for the levels of agreement were as follows: consensus in negative (≤ 2); agreement in negative (≤ 3); no consensus or agreement (3.1–4.9); agreement (≥ 5); consensus (≥ 6). For questions where no positive consensus was reached in Round 1, questions were asked again in Round 2 with the omission of answer choices that reached consensus in negative in Round 1. Round 2 of the survey consisted of 79 questions and was sent to all individuals who fully completed Round 1 in November 2022. For questions where no positive consensus was reached in Round 2, results are presented from either Round 1 or Round 2, depending on which showed the least variability. Institutional review board approval was not applicable. Round 1 of the Delphi survey was sent to 103 members of EARCO and 38/103 (36.9%) pulmonologists from across 15 countries completed all 109 questions (Fig. <xref rid=""Fig1"" ref-type=""fig"">1</xref>). Round 2 was sent to all who completed Round 1 and 36/38 (94.7%) completed all 79 questions. The questions and responses of Round 1 and 2 of the survey are shown in Additional file <xref rid=""MOESM1"" ref-type=""media"">1</xref> and Additional file <xref rid=""MOESM2"" ref-type=""media"">2</xref>, respectively. Tables S1–S3 include details of areas that exhibited trends toward agreement, but for which no conclusions could be drawn.<fig id=""Fig1""><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>Distribution of survey respondents. *Two of the 38 respondents who completed Round 1 did not complete Round 2 (1 respondent retired and 1 was on sabbatical)</p></caption><graphic http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink href=""12931_2024_2929_Fig1_HTML"" id=""MO1""></graphic></fig> Discordance currently exists among published guidelines for the assessment and management of patients with severe AATD [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR12"">12</xref>]. Many published guidelines contain country-specific recommendations and have been developed through literature reviews or expert panels [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR12"">12</xref>]; to our knowledge, this is the first study that attempts to establish a consensus for the treatment and monitoring of patients with AATD using Delphi consensus methodology. Here, we provide current expert opinion on the assessment and monitoring of patients with severe AATD and break these down for those with stable disease and those with worsening disease. Despite the lack of uniformity in AATD assessment and discrepancies in physician opinion, consensus has been achieved in several aspects of the clinical assessment of AATD, such as spirometry, body plethysmography, HRCT, and the initiation of augmentation therapy. Furthermore, there were several areas that almost reached agreement; these areas are ones of current controversy, where hypothesis-based research may now be possible since there are now trends in ways of thinking. Areas with no consensus or agreement at all remain exploratory in research design. The high concordance for the use of spirometry demonstrates its value in the assessment of lung disease associated with AATD. Due to its ease of use, availability, and reproducible and objective measurement of lung function, spirometry is one of the most widely used follow-up methods for AATD. In alignment with established clinical practice guidelines, our findings advocate for the regular use of spirometry assessment in the management of patients with severe AATD [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR17"">17</xref>]. However, it is important to note that a nuanced approach to the scheduling of lung function assessment may be warranted. While the consensus leans towards annual spirometry assessment, results show that for patients experiencing worsening symptoms, spirometric parameters should be assessed more frequently depending on the deterioration pattern of each patient. One survey respondent commented that the frequency of spirometry assessment should not be uniformly prescribed but rather determined on an individual basis. This personalized approach acknowledges the heterogeneity in AATD manifestations among patients; however, while spirometry is a readily accessible diagnostic tool, it does not offer a comprehensive reflection of the extent of parenchymal damage associated with AATD-related pulmonary emphysema [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR17"">17</xref>, <xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR18"">18</xref>]. This limitation implies that spirometric parametric measurements alone should not serve as the sole diagnostic criterion for AATD-related lung disease [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR19"">19</xref>, <xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR20"">20</xref>] and that physicians should consider supplementary diagnostic methods and clinical indicators to gain a more comprehensive understanding of disease progression and its impact on the individual patient. In accordance with clinical guidelines, physicians are advised to incorporate additional measures, such as body plethysmography and diffusion capacity to obtain a comprehensive assessment of lung function [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR1"">1</xref>, <xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR17"">17</xref>]. The agreement among respondents favouring these measures likely stems from their recognition that they provide valuable insights into the extent of lung function decline [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR17"">17</xref>]. Our findings emphasize the value of full lung function assessment in managing patients with AATD; however, it is essential to recognize that there are still areas of discordance among other aspects of clinical guidance. Notably, there was lack of agreement regarding the use of LDCT in both research settings and in routine clinical care. HRCT allows visual identification of early-stage emphysema [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR21"">21</xref>, <xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR22"">22</xref>], which is key to the management of AATD. However, non-inferior image quality and similar anatomical information can be achieved with LDCT protocols, which may be more suited to the serial scanning and density analysis required to monitor disease progression in AATD, as well as the effect of treatment regimens [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR21"">21</xref>]. Other limitations in the use of lung density analysis for routine clinical practice include that specific software and expertise are required for analysis and interpretation of data, there is variability of reference values among scanners and software manufacturers, and lack of standardization and validated CT methodology and analysis protocols [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR23"">23</xref>]. Thus, CT densitometry is a useful imaging tool for AATD-induced emphysema, but more research is needed before it can be used routinely in clinical practice [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR23"">23</xref>]. There was also lack of agreement among survey respondents regarding the use of the 6MWD to assess suitability for augmentation therapy or response to this therapy in patients with stable or worsening respiratory disease associated with severe AATD. Pulmonary rehabilitation (PR) has been shown to be effective for patients with AATD [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR24"">24</xref>, <xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR25"">25</xref>], and the 6MWD is a valid and reliable measure of exercise capacity [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR26"">26</xref>]. PR has been shown to benefit patients with COPD, with and without AATD [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR27"">27</xref>]; however, the authors of the study that demonstrated the benefits of PR in patients with AATD could not determine whether patient comorbidities, which can have profound effects on QoL, may have influenced results [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR27"">27</xref>, <xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR28"">28</xref>]. Nevertheless, data did show that 6MWD is not improved by augmentation therapy alone and only improves when the patients are undergoing PR [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR27"">27</xref>], which may explain why there was no agreement regarding the use of 6MWD to assess response to this therapy in the current study. A potential explanation for the lack of agreement regarding the use of 6MWD to assess suitability for augmentation therapy and to assess response to this therapy may be that, despite the most recent AATD guidelines stating the need to monitor all patients with AATD to assess treatment options using parameters such as FEV<sub>1</sub>, diffusion capacity of the lung for carbon monoxide, 6MWD, and health-related QoL parameters, access to augmentation therapy is highly variable across Europe [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR1"">1</xref>]. Therefore, physicians without access to the therapy may not be familiar with current guidelines regarding methods to assess suitability for augmentation therapy and to assess response to the therapy. Currently, augmentation therapy is reimbursed in Czechia within Eastern Europe, and is covered by public health insurance in Austria, Belgium (only for patients who started the therapy before 2010), France, Germany, Italy, Portugal, and Spain within Western Europe, highlighting the absence of harmonized access to augmentation therapy [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR1"">1</xref>]. This geographical inequality in access to this optimal AATD healthcare ultimately results in different standards of care for AATD in Europe [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR1"">1</xref>]. The present results indicate a high level of concordance regarding the initiation of augmentation therapy in patients with stable and worsening respiratory disease and highlights the importance of AAT levels (which relates closely to genotype) in determining eligibility. The utility of the 11 µM protective threshold as a determinant of clinical risk and as an indicator for commencing augmentation therapy is now considered questionable [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR29"">29</xref>–<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR31"">31</xref>]; nevertheless, it was included in this study since plasma-derived AAT preparations are currently only licensed for patients who have AAT levels below this threshold. Furthermore, the 11 µM threshold (~ 57.2 mg/dL) are still included in several national guidelines as the threshold to define severe AATD and indicate augmentation therapy. However, whether AAT levels are above or below this 11 µM threshold should not guide treatment decisions alone; instead, this should be based on a patient's AATD genotype and other risk factors [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR29"">29</xref>–<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR31"">31</xref>]. It is worth noting that a prior EARCO study highlights significant variability in the criteria for initiating augmentation therapy among European experts [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR32"">32</xref>]. Greulich et al. revealed that factors other than AAT serum levels have a significant influence on the decision to initiate augmentation therapy when patients’ genotypes are considered [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR32"">32</xref>]. For instance, in Pi*ZZ individuals, multivariate analysis identified younger age, reduced FEV<sub>1</sub> (%), FEV<sub>1</sub> decline, and the presence of emphysema by CT as significant in the decision for initiating augmentation therapy [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR32"">32</xref>]. In Pi*SZ patients, age, FEV<sub>1</sub> (%), and emphysema presence on CT were reported as significant in the decision making for the initiation of augmentation therapy [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR32"">32</xref>]. In the present survey, results underscore that FEV<sub>1</sub> and the presence of emphysema by CT are important aspects to consider when initiating augmentation therapy in both patients with stable and worsening respiratory disease. The high level of agreement on the initiation of this therapy here is in stark contrast with the great discordances shown in the study by Greulich et al., which is likely due to the differences in study design. Here, the agreement is on general statements, but when clinicians are confronted with real cases (as in the Greulich et al. paper) their decisions to treat with augmentation therapy may differ greatly and take into consideration several variables that are not included in the current recommendations described in guidelines. Regarding the lack of consensus or agreement in some areas, there are several reasons why consensus or agreement was not reached. A limitation of this study is that due to size, there were only two survey rounds. Further rounds could have increased the number of statements that reached consensus or agreement in order to provide more refined recommendations. Additionally, there are few studies and evidence concerning some of the topics of this survey. AATD is a rare disease; therefore, it is likely that many respiratory physicians do not have a vast amount of experience in providing treatment for patients with AATD, and most knowledge of the management of AATD is derived from experience of managing COPD. The size of the survey could also have been a contributing factor to the low participation rate among EARCO members, though it is more likely that due to the timing, some countries were still battling the COVID-19 emergency and justifiably, the respiratory physicians of EARCO had more pressing matters and responsibilities. Selecting EARCO members to participate in the study ensured expert opinions were gathered from physicians with extensive expertise and interest in the field of AATD, as well as experience with administration of augmentation therapy. However, the geographical spread of the participants was not equally distributed throughout Europe; approximately a quarter of all respondents were from Spain, which may have impacted the results. While our study builds upon guidelines previously published for the assessment and monitoring of patients AATD [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR12"">12</xref>], it largely complements guidelines from the Spanish Society of Pulmonology and Thoracic Surgery (SEPAR) [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR33"">33</xref>], which is not surprising given the distribution of participating physicians. However, the SEPAR guidelines were published in 2015 and so an update is needed. Though, for a more accurate European consensus, more input is greatly needed from physicians of other European countries. The common membership and shared knowledge and adherence to the same guidelines amongst Spanish respondents may have contributed to a heightened level of consensus and agreement compared to physicians practicing in different regions. Furthermore, as most participants were from countries with AAT reimbursement policies, this could also have affected the results on this topic. Physicians may be influenced by their knowledge of the specific guidelines that they use, and country-specific regulations means that all countries do not have access to the same testing and/or treatment options; nevertheless, our results provide a good framework for physicians to approach their regulators to highlight the recommended treatments, and advocate for change, if required, in their area. There is currently a lack of consistent guidance on the diagnosis, treatment, and management of patients with AATD in Europe. The present study provides updated expert opinions for the assessment and monitoring of patients with severe AATD, for those with stable and worsening disease, which were developed from the views of European respiratory physicians. Continuing to build the evidence base for the management of AATD is essential to support access to treatment and ensuring optimal access to effective care in AATD is something that EARCO is deeply committed to.

Personalised indication of augmentation therapy for emphysema associated with severe alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency: a case series,"Severe alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency (AATD) is associated with an increased risk of emphysema. However, the clinical manifestations are very heterogeneous, and an individual prognosis is very difficult to establish. Intravenous augmentation therapy with alpha-1 antitrypsin (AAT) from pooled blood donors is the only specific treatment available, but it requires weekly or biweekly administration for life. Several guidelines provide the indication criteria for the initiation of AAT augmentation therapy. However, in clinical practice, there are situations in which the decision as to when to start treatment becomes uncertain and some studies have shown great variability in the indication of this treatment even among specialists. The usual dilemma is between initiating augmentation therapy in individuals who may not develop significant lung disease or in whom disease will not progress or delaying it in patients who may otherwise rapidly and irreversibly progress. We illustrate this dilemma with five clinical cases: from the case of a patient with normal lung function who requests initiation of therapy to a moderately stable patient without augmentation or a mild patient who, after several years of remaining stable without treatment, deterioration in lung function initiated and, consequently, augmentation therapy was begun. All the nuances associated with the indication of augmentation justify a personalised approach and the decision about initiating augmentation therapy must be made after careful consideration of the pros and cons with the patient in reference centres with experience in treatment. These reference centres can work in collaboration with local hospitals where patients can be closely followed and augmentation therapy can be administered to avoid unnecessary travelling, making periodical administrations more comfortable for the patient.","Alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency (AATD) is a rare genetic disorder caused by mutations in the SERPINA1 gene.<sup><xref rid=""bibr1-17534666241271917"" ref-type=""bibr"">1</xref>,<xref rid=""bibr2-17534666241271917"" ref-type=""bibr"">2</xref></sup> The most frequent mutation causing severe deficiency is known as the Z mutation.

<xref rid=""bibr3-17534666241271917"" ref-type=""bibr"">3</xref>
</sup> The polymerisation and accumulation in the liver generate a severe deficiency of circulating AAT that is not able to provide enough protection to the lungs against free neutrophil elastase and increases the risk of developing pulmonary emphysema, particularly in smokers.<sup><xref rid=""bibr1-17534666241271917"" ref-type=""bibr"">1</xref>,<xref rid=""bibr2-17534666241271917"" ref-type=""bibr"">2</xref></sup> The typical presentation of lung disease is in the form of panacinar emphysema starting in the fourth or fifth decade of life; however, the clinical expression of lung disease is very variable and may include from asymptomatic disease to different phenotypes of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), asthma with chronic airflow limitation and bronchiectasis.<sup>
<xref rid=""bibr4-17534666241271917"" ref-type=""bibr"">4</xref>
</sup> This heterogeneity makes it important to test all adults with COPD for the deficiency, since early diagnosis allows a change in habits, particularly quitting smoking, pharmacologic and non-pharmacologic treatment, and specific augmentation therapy with intravenous alpha-1 antitrypsin (AAT) in patients in whom it is indicated.<sup>

</sup> In the late 1980s, augmentation therapy was approved by the US Food and Drug Administration based on the demonstration of its biochemical efficacy in restoring anti-elastase activity in serum and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid. To demonstrate its clinical efficacy, the US National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute designed a prospective registry that followed 1129 patients on and off treatment for 5 years. This registry demonstrated a significant reduction in the rate of decline in forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV<sub>1</sub>) only in patients receiving augmentation with a baseline FEV<sub>1</sub> between 35% and 49% predicted.<sup>

The second case is an example of a patient who fulfilled all the criteria for augmentation therapy, but treatment was not initiated and the lung disease remained stable over 17 years without augmentation therapy. Two important observations can be made from this case; the first is that most lung damage is produced before diagnosis, when patients are unaware of their condition and do not adopt any preventative measure, such as quitting smoking, avoiding other exposures or adequately managing their lung disease; and the second is that, in some cases, these preventative measures and optimal pharmacological and non-pharmacological treatment for COPD may be enough to stop the progression of emphysema, at least for some years. This observation implies that in subjects of advanced age with moderate severity of lung disease and good ventilatory reserve it may be justified to delay the indication of augmentation therapy, always after careful discussion about the pros and cons with the patient, as in the case of patient two, who declined the treatment, and patient five, in whom we recommended not to treat due to the absence of chronic airflow limitation and the absence of significant emphysema in the chest CT scan. On the contrary, we strongly recommended the initiation of augmentation therapy as soon as possible for patients three and four because, despite their relatively young age, they had clearly non-reversible airflow obstruction with a significant reduction in diffusion capacity and important emphysema on CT scans. Although it may have been possible to stabilise their lung disease without augmentation therapy, the risk of further irreversible loss of lung tissue was too great to justify this conservative approach. The evolution of case four was remarkable. This patient had very poor lung function at presentation to our clinic, making him a candidate for lung transplantation, but he survived for 22 years on augmentation therapy without transplantation and with a reasonable quality of life until the very last years. This case is in agreement with the results of the observational studies showing improved survival of patients on augmentation therapy,<sup><xref rid=""bibr7-17534666241271917"" ref-type=""bibr"">7</xref>,<xref rid=""bibr32-17534666241271917"" ref-type=""bibr"">32</xref></sup> and also illustrates the benefits of augmentation therapy in very severe patients (i.e. those with an FEV<sub>1</sub> (%) <30%.<sup>

</sup> or airflow limitation and, consequently, did not fulfil the criteria for augmentation therapy. However, after 11 years of follow-up, it was decided to initiate treatment after a decline in lung function was observed in more than one consecutive spirometry, and some initial lesions of emphysema appeared in the CT scan after several episodes of exacerbation and COVID-19 infection.<sup>

It could have been argued that this impairment could have been prevented if the patient had initiated augmentation therapy at the initial visit, but this would have represented weekly intravenous infusions for 11 years for limited benefits since the patient is now 70 years of age and, despite this mild impairment, still has a well-preserved lung function and good exercise capacity and quality of life.

The PiM allele produces the standard form and normal levels (1.2–2 g/L) of alpha-1 antitrypsin (AAT) protein, which functions to protect tissues from enzymes released during inflammation, particularly in the lungs [<xref rid=""B1-arm-92-00028"" ref-type=""bibr"">1</xref>]. The most common mutant alleles of the <italic toggle=""yes"">SERPINA1</italic> gene are Pi*Z (Glu342Lys) and Pi*S (Glu264Val). Individuals with two mutated alleles (homozygous or compound heterozygous) have significantly reduced levels of functional AAT and are at much higher risk of various types of liver diseases in both children and adults, as well as lung disease at a young age, and the disorder occasionally occurs as vasculitis, necrotizing panniculitis, or other chronic inflammatory diseases [<xref rid=""B2-arm-92-00028"" ref-type=""bibr"">2</xref>]. Nearly 100 percent of the clinical cases of AATD-associated pathologies involve the Pi*Z allele, as PiZZ homozygous or less frequently as compound heterozygous [<xref rid=""B3-arm-92-00028"" ref-type=""bibr"">3</xref>]. In clinical practice, pulmonary emphysema, bronchiectasis, and chronic bronchitis are the most frequently associated with PiZZ [<xref rid=""B4-arm-92-00028"" ref-type=""bibr"">4</xref>] while the significance of heterozygous variants such as PiSZ, PiMZ, and PiMS is less clear [<xref rid=""B5-arm-92-00028"" ref-type=""bibr"">5</xref>,<xref rid=""B6-arm-92-00028"" ref-type=""bibr"">6</xref>,<xref rid=""B7-arm-92-00028"" ref-type=""bibr"">7</xref>]. Other less common mutant alleles include Pi*F (fast migration) and Pi*I (intermediate migration), which produce AAT with slightly altered function and usually do not cause significant clinical symptoms. Null alleles (e.g., Pi*Q0) result in not measurable or very low levels of AAT and high risk for pulmonary diseases [<xref rid=""B8-arm-92-00028"" ref-type=""bibr"">8</xref>]. To date, hundreds of variants of the <italic toggle=""yes"">SERPINA1</italic> gene have been identified and about 70 of them have been associated with clinical manifestations [<xref rid=""B1-arm-92-00028"" ref-type=""bibr"">1</xref>].  In this study, we aimed to determine the prevalence of Pi*Z and Pi*S AATD variants in a cohort of Lithuanian small children diagnosed as wheezers of varying severity and compare findings with the control group as well as with data earlier collected from COPD patients in the Central–Eastern European AAT Network and non-disease specific epidemiological studies (SES) performed in our region [<xref rid=""B9-arm-92-00028"" ref-type=""bibr"">9</xref>,<xref rid=""B10-arm-92-00028"" ref-type=""bibr"">10</xref>].  In total, 145 children with an acute wheezing episode were included in the study. In addition, 74 children without respiratory conditions who were hospitalized for various surgical pathology and required a blood sample in preparation for surgery were used as a control group (<xref rid=""arm-92-00028-t001"" ref-type=""table"">Table 1</xref>). The study was carried out with the permission of the Lithuanian Bioethics Committee (L-16-07/2). Blood samples were taken on dry blood spot cards and sent to the National Institute of Tuberculosis and Lung Diseases in Warsaw, Poland. Diagnostic tests performed included determination of AAT concentration, phenotyping, genotyping, and DNA sequencing when appropriate.  Wheezing severity, which was classified into mild, medium, and severe, was calculated using the Pediatric Respiratory Assessment Measure (PRAM). We looked for an association between AAT genotypes and the severity of wheezing. A common “cold” was diagnosed based on anamnesis and objective examination data. Complaints expressed by parents (fever, runny nose, cough) and objective examination data were evaluated according to the algorithm approved by the hospital, and patients with wheezing syndrome were divided into two groups—children with wheezing when having a cold and children with wheezing without having a cold. Data for comparison with COPD patients were taken from the CEE A1AT Network, established within the LPP Leonardo da Vinci EU program (2011-1-PL-LEO04-197151) “Introducing standards of the best medical practice for the patients with inherited Alpha-1 Antitrypsin Deficiency in Central Eastern Europe” DBS samples were collected from 328 COPD patients between October 2012 and January 2013. The data were also compared with two previous epidemiological studies conducted with healthy Lithuanian subjects (N = 2491) in determining the general population frequency of PI*S and PI*Z genes [<xref rid=""B11-arm-92-00028"" ref-type=""bibr"">11</xref>,<xref rid=""B12-arm-92-00028"" ref-type=""bibr"">12</xref>]. Statistical analysis was performed using IBM SPSS Statistics version 20.0 and Microsoft Excel 365. Continuous and categorical variables were presented as median (interquartile range (IQR) and numbers (percentages %), respectively. Mann–Whitney U or Friedman test was used to compare continuous variables, and χ<sup>2</sup> test or Fisher’s exact test was used to compare categorical variables. A two-sided <italic toggle=""yes"">p</italic>-value < 0.05 was considered significant. Pi*Z and Pi*S frequency is expressed as a frequency per thousand alleles with 95% CI (e.g., 3 Pi*Z alleles were found out of 74 subjects, i.e., 148 alleles, then the frequency per 1000 alleles is calculated as follows: 3 × 1000/148 = 20.27).  Childhood wheezing illness appears to be associated with an increased risk of developing COPD in adulthood [<xref rid=""B13-arm-92-00028"" ref-type=""bibr"">13</xref>,<xref rid=""B14-arm-92-00028"" ref-type=""bibr"">14</xref>,<xref rid=""B15-arm-92-00028"" ref-type=""bibr"">15</xref>]. This association may be due to several factors. For example, children with wheezing illnesses may be more sensitive to environmental factors such as tobacco smoke, air pollution, and respiratory infections [<xref rid=""B16-arm-92-00028"" ref-type=""bibr"">16</xref>,<xref rid=""B17-arm-92-00028"" ref-type=""bibr"">17</xref>,<xref rid=""B18-arm-92-00028"" ref-type=""bibr"">18</xref>]. Persistent inflammation from repeated wheezing episodes can lead to structural changes in the lungs, including airway remodeling and reduced elasticity, which are key characteristics of COPD. Overall, the relationship between childhood wheezing and adult COPD highlights the importance of early identification and management of respiratory issues in children to potentially mitigate long-term adverse outcomes on lung health. Children who experience wheezing may have underlying genetic factors that predispose them to both early-life respiratory issues and the development of COPD later in life. Certain genetic variants, like those in the SERPINA1 gene associated with AATD, can contribute to both childhood wheezing and adult airway disorders. However, the existing data are controversial. For instance, several studies have reported an association between AATD and adult bronchial asthma [<xref rid=""B19-arm-92-00028"" ref-type=""bibr"">19</xref>,<xref rid=""B20-arm-92-00028"" ref-type=""bibr"">20</xref>,<xref rid=""B21-arm-92-00028"" ref-type=""bibr"">21</xref>]. In contrast, the relationship between AATD and childhood bronchial asthma remains debated [<xref rid=""B22-arm-92-00028"" ref-type=""bibr"">22</xref>,<xref rid=""B23-arm-92-00028"" ref-type=""bibr"">23</xref>,<xref rid=""B24-arm-92-00028"" ref-type=""bibr"">24</xref>]. Our study, based on the ALSPAC cohort, did not show an association between SERPINA1 gene polymorphisms and the risk of developing bronchial asthma in school-aged children [<xref rid=""B25-arm-92-00028"" ref-type=""bibr"">25</xref>]. Our current results show that the frequency of the Pi*Z allele in wheezing small children is significantly higher than in the control group (44.8% [95% CI: 32.1–57.5] vs. 20.27% [95% CI: 11.53–29.01], respectively). Additionally, the prevalence of the Pi*Z allele in these children (44.8 alleles per 1000) is higher compared to general population estimates based on data from 21 European countries [<xref rid=""B26-arm-92-00028"" ref-type=""bibr"">26</xref>,<xref rid=""B27-arm-92-00028"" ref-type=""bibr"">27</xref>].  Interestingly, we found more Pi*S variants in the control group than in the wheezing group. This observation might be related to the fact that the primary pathologies in the control group, which necessitated surgeries, were conditions such as abdominal wall and inguinal hernias (52.7%), port wine stains (14.9%), benign tumors (8.1%), vascular malformations (8.1%), cystic formations (6.8%), hemorrhoidal nodes (2.7%), and other individual cases (6.8%). It is possible that these pathologies are associated with AATD, as AAT is a major inhibitor of neutrophil proteases and certain metalloproteases involved in remodeling and repairing connective tissue. This connection could explain the higher prevalence of PiS variants in the control group [<xref rid=""B28-arm-92-00028"" ref-type=""bibr"">28</xref>,<xref rid=""B29-arm-92-00028"" ref-type=""bibr"">29</xref>]. We also compared the frequency of Pi*S and Pi*Z alleles among wheezing children with previously reported data on the frequencies of these alleles in COPD patients from the Central–Eastern European AAT Network and non-disease-specific epidemiological studies performed in Lithuania [<xref rid=""B9-arm-92-00028"" ref-type=""bibr"">9</xref>,<xref rid=""B10-arm-92-00028"" ref-type=""bibr"">10</xref>]. The frequency of the Pi*S and Pi*Z alleles among wheezing children was like the frequency observed among COPD patients: PiS 10.3% (95% CI: 4.0–16.6) vs. 15.8% (95% CI: 6.92–24.6) and PiZ 44.8% (95% CI: 32.1–57.5) vs. 46.1% (95% CI: 31.1–60.9). Furthermore, the Pi*Z allele was significantly more common in wheezing children compared to data from non-disease-specific epidemiological studies, with a frequency of 44.8% (95% CI: 32.1–57.5) vs. 13.6% (95% CI: 10.7–17.4). Taken together, findings from our single-center cohort of small children diagnosed as wheezers suggest the necessity of verifying the role of AAT heterozygous mutations in the manifestation of wheezing and the further development of COPD. Understanding how these genetic variations contribute to early respiratory issues can provide valuable insights into the mechanisms underlying both childhood wheezing and adult COPD. By examining larger and more diverse cohorts, researchers can better determine the specific impact of heterozygous AAT mutations on respiratory health. This includes understanding how these mutations affect AAT levels and lung function from an early age. Moreover, early identification of children with AAT mutations could allow for targeted interventions aimed at preventing the progression of wheezing to more severe respiratory conditions. With a clearer understanding of the genetic factors involved, it may be possible to develop preventative strategies or treatments that can mitigate the risk of developing COPD in later life for those identified as genetically predisposed. Overall, ongoing research is crucial to fully elucidate the relationship between AAT heterozygous mutations, early-life wheezing, and the risk of developing COPD, ultimately contributing to better prevention, diagnosis, and treatment strategies.",N/A,05 8 2024

Nevertheless, a large prospective study of 200 000 Swedish pediatric patients (consisting of 127, 2 and 54 pediatric patients with AATD and Pi*ZZ, Pi*Z null and Pi*SZ genotypes, respectively) reported that 22 patients (17.3%) aged ≤6 months with the Pi*ZZ genotype had clinical signs of liver disease.<xref rid=""cit0012"" ref-type=""bibr"">12</xref> Additionally, in a study of 350 patients aged 0 to 25 years with a Pi*ZZ or Pi*SZ genotype, 28 developed definite or possible portal hypertension (defined as either ascites or endoscopic evidence of esophageal or gastric varices or other findings consistent with portal hypertension) during follow-up and 32 patients had a liver transplantation or died.<xref rid=""cit0013"" ref-type=""bibr"">13</xref> Finally, in a Swedish registry of 1595 adults with the Pi*ZZ genotype followed for a mean of 12 (range 0.3–24) years, 3% of patients manifested liver disease at inclusion, and an additional 7% developed liver disease during the follow-up period;<xref rid=""cit0005"" ref-type=""bibr"">5</xref> in support, data from the UK Biobank demonstrated that the risk of developing liver fibrosis or cirrhosis was 20 times higher in patients with AATD and a Pi*ZZ genotype than non-carriers.<xref rid=""cit0014"" ref-type=""bibr"">14</xref> No previous study has used the same methodology to analyze liver-related clinical events in both adult and pediatric patients, thus permitting a direct comparison of age-related differences. In addition, no previous study has compared liver-related clinical events between adults with AATD with liver disease and adults with AATD with both liver and lung disease. Therefore, the aim of this study was to investigate the burden of liver-related clinical events among a cohort of adult and pediatric patients with AATD. To enable the inclusion of a sufficient number of patients with AATD from across the USA, this study leveraged data from a national administrative claims database in the USA.   This real-world study adds to the limited literature on the clinical course of AATD with liver disease alone, AATD with both liver and lung disease in adult patients and AATD with liver disease in pediatric patients, by providing an understanding of the burden of liver-related clinical events. In addition, to the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to measure liver-related clinical events in both adult and pediatric patients using the same methodology. In adults, the rates of liver-related clinical events were higher when patients had both liver and lung disease than liver disease only. This could be attributed to a higher number of events or shorter time at risk in the AATD with both liver and lung disease health state; however, the difference in average time at risk in person-years between the groups was minimal (2.30 years in the AATD with liver disease health state and 2.21 years in the AATD with both liver and lung disease health state). This may also be related to the higher median age of adult patients with AATD and both liver and lung disease. For both adult and pediatric patients, ascites, hepatic encephalopathy and gastrointestinal bleed were more frequently observed than spontaneous bacterial peritonitis and hepatocellular carcinoma (<xref rid=""f0002"" ref-type=""fig"">Figure 2A</xref> and <xref rid=""f0002"" ref-type=""fig"">B</xref>), although the event rate PPY for ascites was notably lower in the pediatric 6–17 years age group (<xref rid=""f0002"" ref-type=""fig"">Figure 2B</xref>). Interestingly, for patients aged <1 and 1–5 years, our study reported more cases of hepatocellular carcinoma than prior studies.<xref rid=""cit0015"" ref-type=""bibr"">15</xref> While hepatocellular carcinoma is seen in pediatric patients with AATD,<xref rid=""cit0006"" ref-type=""bibr"">6</xref>,<xref rid=""cit0016"" ref-type=""bibr"">16</xref> it is an extraordinarily rare finding, and therefore previously published shorter case series may not have been best suited to identifying patients with hepatocellular carcinoma.<xref rid=""cit0015"" ref-type=""bibr"">15</xref> As such, more cases of hepatocellular carcinoma may exist than are currently reported in prior studies. While liver transplantation events were reported in pediatric patients aged <6 years, there were no reported liver transplantation or hepatocellular carcinoma events in patients aged 6–17 years, indicating greater disease burden in younger versus older pediatric patients. Consistent with this, a prior Swedish birth cohort of 127 pediatric patients with Pi*ZZ genotypes identified by isoelectric focusing reported two liver disease-related deaths within the first year of life, and an additional three deaths in patients aged 1–8 years, while fewer liver-related clinical events were identified throughout adolescence.<xref rid=""cit0012"" ref-type=""bibr"">12</xref> In addition, in a US registry study among 350 patients with AATD and either a Pi*ZZ or Pi*SZ genotype, a median age of 4.2 years at registry enrollment and a median follow-up time of 2.5 years, the rate of development of portal hypertension was 0.02 PPY and the rate of liver transplantation or death was 0.03 PPY.<xref rid=""cit0013"" ref-type=""bibr"">13</xref> Collectively, these findings suggest the need for early monitoring of pediatric patients for the development of ascites and progression to severe liver disease. For adult and pediatric patients, the earliest encountered liver-related clinical events were ascites, gastrointestinal bleed and hepatic encephalopathy (<xref rid=""f0003"" ref-type=""fig"">Figure 3A</xref> and <xref rid=""f0003"" ref-type=""fig"">B</xref>). Within the pediatric population, the median time to liver-related clinical events varied by age group; for example, time to gastrointestinal bleed and hepatic encephalopathy increased with age while spontaneous bacterial peritonitis and hepatocellular carcinoma decreased in the older pediatric age groups. The median time to composite event was lower for adults (26.5 days) than pediatric patients (85.5, 95.0 and 184.5 days for the <1 year, 1–5 years and 6–17 years groups, respectively). The short median time to event in adults suggests that the diagnosis is often established at the time of a clinical event at more advanced stages of liver disease, not when prospective follow-up of patients with AATD is ongoing. Therefore, the late diagnosis of AATD with liver disease is a barrier to efficiently enrolling patients in interventional studies at a time prior to the development of cirrhosis and delays the timely intervention of lifestyle modifications and potential treatments. The strengths of this study include the size of the patient population, with 5136 patients characterized, which represents a large sample of patients with AATD. A person–time approach was undertaken to maximize the use of patient data and to standardize reporting of outcomes for each health state given the variable time in each health state. The limitations of this study include that these findings are from commercially insured patients and may not be generalizable to the wider US population. Additionally, ascertainment bias is common in this type of study, which may explain the higher hepatocellular carcinoma event rate in pediatric patients in this study compared with those occurring in the entire population of pediatric patients with AATD with liver disease. Furthermore, the number of pediatric patients in the sample was low, particularly in the 1–5 years group, which warrants additional studies to confirm these findings. The overall burden may also be underestimated owing to an under-representation of older patients (≥65 years of age) in the databases used, who are more likely to have AATD with liver disease or AATD with both liver and lung disease. In addition, when using administrative claims databases, a diagnosis for AATD is dependent on ICD-9-CM and ICD-10-CM diagnosis codes which do not specify genotype. As such, this results in a lack of genotype data in administrative claims databases. Indeed, no patients were identified with a confirmed Pi*ZZ genotype and only 13 patients were identified with a confirmed Pi*MZ genotype, and therefore stratification of patient data by genotype was not feasible. Although ICD-9-CM and ICD-10-CM diagnosis codes for AATD exist, it can be challenging to confirm an AATD with liver disease or AATD with lung disease diagnosis as there are no specific diagnosis codes for AATD combined with the manifestations, which may have led to the exclusion of some patients who would have otherwise been eligible. Furthermore, AATD diagnosis codes are required when requesting AATD-related laboratory tests prior to a confirmed AATD diagnosis, which may lead to the inclusion of patients without AATD but with AATD medical records for screening; this limitation was minimized in this study by requiring two diagnosis codes for AATD at outpatient visits at least 90 days apart. Finally, it was not possible to identify the fibrosis stage in patients with liver disease using ICD-9-CM or ICD-10-CM diagnosis codes. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study of liver-related clinical events and time to event in a large sample of adult and pediatric patients with AATD (not specifically among patients with a Pi*ZZ genotype). This study adds to the limited literature by providing a real-world understanding of the clinical burden of AATD with liver disease. The high rate of liver-related clinical events reported in our study demonstrates that AATD with liver disease has a substantial burden on adult and pediatric patients. Most notably, younger pediatric patients (aged <6 years) should be monitored for occurrence of liver-related clinical events to avoid decompensating events. The short median time to liver-related clinical events in adults suggests that patients often have advanced liver disease at the initial diagnosis date and are being diagnosed late in their disease journey. New treatment options are warranted to avoid disease progression, which can lead to liver transplantation. Further research should examine the rate of liver-related clinical events by genotype in adult and pediatric patients with AATD with liver disease to understand how genotype may impact disease severity.",N/A,24 7 2024
"A novel <italic toggle=""yes"">in vitro</italic> cell model of the proteinase/antiproteinase balance observed in alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency","
<bold>Background:</bold> Alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency (AATD) is a genetic condition resulting from mutations in the alpha-1 antitrypsin (AAT) protein, a major systemic antiproteinase, resulting in reduced/no release of AAT, disrupting the proteinase/antiproteinase balance. A sustained imbalance can cause structural changes to the lung parenchyma, leading to emphysema. Predicting and assessing human responses to potential therapeutic candidates from preclinical animal studies have been challenging. Our aims were to develop a more physiologically relevant <italic toggle=""yes"">in vitro</italic> model of the proteinase/antiproteinase balance and assess whether the data generated could better predict the efficacy of pharmacological candidates to inform decisions on clinical trials, together with expected biomarker responses. 
<bold>Methods:</bold> We developed an <italic toggle=""yes"">in vitro</italic> model assessing the proteinase/antiproteinase balance by the changes in the fibrinogen cleavage products of neutrophil elastase (NE) and proteinase 3 (PR3). This allowed the assessment of physiological and pharmaceutical neutrophil serine proteinase (NSP) inhibitors to determine the putative threshold at which the maximal effect is achieved. 
<bold>Results:</bold> AAT significantly reduced NE and PR3 activity footprints, with the maximal reduction achieved at concentrations above 10 μM. The inhibitor MPH966 alone also significantly reduced NE footprint generation in a concentration-dependent manner, leveling out above 100 nM but had no effect on the PR3 footprint. At levels of AAT consistent with AATD, MPH966 had an additive effect, reducing the NE activity footprint more than either inhibitor alone. 
<bold>Conclusion:</bold> Our results support an inhibitor threshold above which the activity footprint generation appears resistant to increasing dosage. Our model can support the testing of inhibitors, confirming activity biomarkers as indicators of likely pharmaceutical efficacy, the assessment of NSP activity in the pathophysiology of emphysema, and the likely function of biological or pharmacological inhibitors in disease management.","Alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency (AATD) is an inflammatory condition arising from genetic mutations in the alpha-1 antitrypsin (AAT) gene SERPINA1 (<xref rid=""B44"" ref-type=""bibr"">Zorzetto et al., 2008</xref>), resulting in little/no secretion of the major antiproteinase AAT that is crucial for the modulation of the destructive potential of neutrophil serine proteinases (NSPs). AAT is a polymorphic protein encoded on chromosome 14 expressed by two alleles in a codominant manner (<xref rid=""B29"" ref-type=""bibr"">Sefton et al., 1990</xref>). The deficiency severity varies depending on the homozygous or heterozygous combination of the normal or deficient alleles. Most healthy individuals carry two M alleles, resulting in a plasma concentration of 20–40 μM (<xref rid=""B3"" ref-type=""bibr"">Brantly et al., 1991</xref>; <xref rid=""B8"" ref-type=""bibr"">Ferrarotti et al., 2012</xref>). The most common deficiency alleles associated with the reduced production of AAT are the S and Z alleles. The S variant results from a point mutation substituting glutamic acid with valine at position 264 (rs17580) (<xref rid=""B22"" ref-type=""bibr"">Long et al., 1984</xref>). The S variant produces 40%–50% less AAT compared to the normal M variant and shows an increased likelihood of polymerization (<xref rid=""B7"" ref-type=""bibr"">Elliott et al., 1996</xref>). However, the S variant on its own is less concerning from a clinical viewpoint unless combined with the Z variant, which results in a plasma AAT level between 8 and 15 μM, breaching the threshold of adequate protection against NSPs (<11 μM) (<xref rid=""B43"" ref-type=""bibr"">Wewers et al., 1987</xref>; <xref rid=""B3"" ref-type=""bibr"">Brantly et al., 1991</xref>; <xref rid=""B8"" ref-type=""bibr"">Ferrarotti et al., 2012</xref>). The most prevalent and clinically relevant deficient cases of AATD are those homozygous for the Z allele, caused by a point mutation replacing glutamic acid to lysine at position 342 (rs28929474) in the mature AAT protein (<xref rid=""B18"" ref-type=""bibr"">Kidd et al., 1983</xref>). The Z-variant AAT (Z-AAT) protein is much more susceptible to polymerization and formation of intracellular aggregates, which impedes secretion into the circulation, resulting in very low plasma AAT levels of less than 5 μM (<xref rid=""B2"" ref-type=""bibr"">Bathurst et al., 1984</xref>; <xref rid=""B21"" ref-type=""bibr"">Loebermann et al., 1984</xref>; <xref rid=""B6"" ref-type=""bibr"">Cox et al., 1986</xref>). Additionally, Z-AAT also displays a reduced association rate with target serine proteinases, indicating that they are less effective than the normal AAT protein in inhibiting serine proteinases (<xref rid=""B27"" ref-type=""bibr"">Ogushi et al., 1987</xref>). Homeostasis is maintained between proteinases and protective antiproteinases in healthy tissues. However, this homeostasis is markedly disrupted in AATD, resulting in a pathophysiological proteinase/antiproteinase imbalance (<xref rid=""B35"" ref-type=""bibr"">Stockley, 1999</xref>; <xref rid=""B32"" ref-type=""bibr"">Sinden and Stockley, 2013</xref>; <xref rid=""B31"" ref-type=""bibr"">Sinden et al., 2015</xref>). The reduced amount of AAT disrupts this physiological homeostasis, resulting in enhanced proteinase activity, especially in the airways, causing irreversible emphysematous and airway changes associated with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) (<xref rid=""B35"" ref-type=""bibr"">Stockley, 1999</xref>). Uninhibited proteinases are able to cleave major extracellular matrix proteins, such as elastin and collagen (as well as fibrinogen), during neutrophil migration, damaging core lung structures - leading to the development of emphysema (<xref rid=""B30"" ref-type=""bibr"">Senior et al., 1977</xref>; <xref rid=""B15"" ref-type=""bibr"">Kao et al., 1988</xref>) and the amplification of neutrophilic inflammation. Clinically, an AAT serum level below 11 μM suggests an increased risk of developing emphysematous changes and airflow obstruction and has been termed the putative “at-risk threshold” (<xref rid=""B43"" ref-type=""bibr"">Wewers et al., 1987</xref>), generally accepted as the minimum level targeted by AAT augmentation therapy (<xref rid=""B23"" ref-type=""bibr"">Lucey et al., 1985</xref>). The key sites of damage in COPD are the lung interstitium and the airways. Monitoring this process and its potential modulation presents a major challenge, although routine augmentation therapy reduces detectable inflammation in the airways (<xref rid=""B37"" ref-type=""bibr"">Stockley et al., 2002</xref>) and emphysema progression (<xref rid=""B25"" ref-type=""bibr"">Miravitlles et al., 2017</xref>). Studies have shown that neutrophil migration into the alveolar space is accompanied by fibrinogen fibrils (<xref rid=""B4"" ref-type=""bibr"">Burns et al., 2003</xref>). At such close proximity, degranulation releases NSPs which interacts with fibrinogen prior to inhibition by AAT, producing specific cleavage products that can recirculate into the systemic circulation via lymph drainage (<xref rid=""B5"" ref-type=""bibr"">Carter et al., 2011</xref>). Studies have shown that the specific NE cleavage product can be measured in the plasma, relates to the plasma AAT level consistent with a physiological threshold of protection at approximately 11 μM, and is reduced by augmentation therapy (<xref rid=""B5"" ref-type=""bibr"">Carter et al., 2011</xref>; <xref rid=""B45"" ref-type=""bibr"">Carter et al., 2015</xref>). AATD plasma samples measured for NE- or PR3-specific activity footprints confirm that the levels are increased compared to healthy smoking volunteers and demonstrate different profiles between AAT genotypes that likely reflect the underlying pathophysiological processes (<xref rid=""B26"" ref-type=""bibr"">Newby et al., 2019</xref>). It was hypothesized that a proof-of-concept model could be developed, which would enable the assessment of the physiological and potential therapeutic impact on the proteinase/antiproteinase balance with specific characterization of the effect of AATD and its management. Proteinase activity footprints were used to describe the development and further validation of a novel neutrophil/fibrinogen-buffer model of footprint generation by uninhibited proteinase activity, termed the “proteinase/antiproteinase balance model.” The primary purpose of this model was to describe changes in proteinase activity related to inhibitor concentrations and support therapeutic applications, initially providing further data on the putative AAT “protective threshold” and potential efficacy of therapeutic inhibitors.   We established an <italic toggle=""yes"">in vitro</italic> model to mimic the proteinase/antiproteinase balance in the presence of activated neutrophils and a target substrate generating specific NSP products measurable <italic toggle=""yes"">in vivo</italic>. The model would allow the assessment of the generation of NE and PR3 footprint markers in the presence of natural or pharmacological inhibitors for interpreting relevant <italic toggle=""yes"">in vivo</italic> data. The use of stimulated neutrophils and cleavage proteinase-generated fibrinogen cleavage products (AαVal<sup>360</sup> and AαVal<sup>541</sup>) are considered useful biomarkers already documented as having measurable effects <italic toggle=""yes"">in vivo</italic>, providing early readouts as proof of concept for putative clinical efficacy. The changes in the enzyme-specific footprints were validated in plasma-treated neutrophils, reflecting the concentrations of AAT in the disease and providing further support for the model. Measuring NE and PR3 activities as a treatment outcome is particularly important when investigating the treatment effects of chronic neutrophilic diseases, such as AATD, where these enzymes are considered primary drivers of the disease process. To date, assessing <italic toggle=""yes"">in vivo</italic> NE and PR3 activity has been made difficult by the broad range of shared substrates and the generation of non-specific cleavage products (<xref rid=""B41"" ref-type=""bibr"">Viglio et al., 2021</xref>). We previously showed the specificity and reliability of the fibrinogenic peptides AαVal<sup>360</sup> and AαVal<sup>541</sup> as markers of NE and PR3, respectively (<xref rid=""B5"" ref-type=""bibr"">Carter et al., 2011</xref>; <xref rid=""B26"" ref-type=""bibr"">Newby et al., 2019</xref>). Both of these enzymes have been implicated in the pathophysiology of AATD-mediated lung disease (<xref rid=""B36"" ref-type=""bibr"">Stockley, 2020</xref>). Thus, the assessment of both NE and PR3 activity would allow the investigation of drug specificity and any synergistic effect, especially as evidence suggests that PR3 may play a greater role in driving emphysema generation than that attributed historically to NE alone (<xref rid=""B19"" ref-type=""bibr"">Korkmaz et al., 2005</xref>; <xref rid=""B31"" ref-type=""bibr"">Sinden et al., 2015</xref>). Our <italic toggle=""yes"">in vitro</italic> model captured the enzymatic footprint changes consistent with clinical observations in patients and provides a quick and reproducible way to assess the cellular response effects of putative therapeutic compounds for the NSP axis and AAT at levels consistent with AATD before and during augmentation therapy. The current model is limited to assessing only NE and PR3 footprints and does not evaluate the potential impact of cathepsin G, which has also been reported to contribute to elastin degradation, at least in a cigarette smoke-induced animal model of emphysema (<xref rid=""B11"" ref-type=""bibr"">Guyot et al., 2014</xref>). Current literature concerning the direct involvement of cathepsin G in AATD remains scarce (<xref rid=""B23"" ref-type=""bibr"">Lucey et al., 1985</xref>; <xref rid=""B11"" ref-type=""bibr"">Guyot et al., 2014</xref>). A similar fibrinogen-specific cleavage can be generated to assess the possible cathepsin G contribution to the overall pathophysiology of AATD. However, at present, the model provides a way to assess therapeutics that can primarily affect NE or PR3 activity footprints <italic toggle=""yes"">via</italic> upstream neutrophil activation and degranulation, as well as direct inhibition. This novel <italic toggle=""yes"">in vitro</italic> model provides a quick, efficient, and cheaper first step to investigate potential therapeutics for animal models with markers specific to humans for subsequent early phases of drug development. Based on the pharmacokinetic profile of MPH966, it was reported that a clinically meaningful effect requires a plasma concentration greater than 300 nM of MPH966 (<xref rid=""B10"" ref-type=""bibr"">Gunawardena et al., 2013</xref>) and that a minimum dosing regimen of at least 240 mg twice daily (<italic toggle=""yes"">bid</italic>) is required to achieve this in humans (<xref rid=""B28"" ref-type=""bibr"">Parkin, 2022</xref>). The observed maximal inhibitory effect of MPH966 on proteinase footprints from our model at this clinical dose (300 nM) implied that the model provides supporting evidence for determining the effective dose for phase I/II trials, enabling informed decisions on suitability and dosing for phase III clinical efficacy studies. This was corroborated in the recently completed 12-week clinical trial investigating the effects of MPH966 in patients with AATD (NCT03636347). The investigators reported a significant, consistent reduction in the NE footprint (AαVal<sup>360</sup>) compared to baseline (−22.7%, <italic toggle=""yes"">p</italic> = 0.004) in the high-dose arm (240 mg <italic toggle=""yes"">bid</italic>) while not observed in the low-dose arm (120 mg <italic toggle=""yes"">bid</italic>) (<xref rid=""B38"" ref-type=""bibr"">Stockley et al., 2023</xref>). We present an <italic toggle=""yes"">in vitro</italic> model of the proteinase/antiproteinase balance in the presence of activated neutrophils and a susceptible substrate. The data demonstrated the role of AAT in suppressing the destructive actions of NE and PR3 in AATD and illustrated how a reduction in AAT results in increased pericellular activity of proteinases. The data further provided supportive evidence of a threshold below which neutrophilic activity is enhanced and a putative dose-ranging template for new compounds to be assessed for equivalence or additive impact on AAT for therapeutic strategies. Finally, the data presented suggested that MPH966 may function as an effective inhibitor of excessive pericellular proteinase activity at the low concentrations observed in pharmacokinetic studies, and together with AAT data, this suggests that the inhibitor has an additive effect. The evidence supports its further development in phase III trials of AATD alone or in combination with AAT augmentation therapy.",N/A,01 7 2024
Induced Pluripotent Stem Cells and CRISPR-Cas9 Innovations for Treating Alpha-1 Antitrypsin Deficiency and Glycogen Storage Diseases,"Human induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) and CRISPR-Cas9 gene-editing technologies have become powerful tools in disease modeling and treatment. By harnessing recent biotechnological advancements, this review aims to equip researchers and clinicians with a comprehensive and updated understanding of the evolving treatment landscape for metabolic and genetic disorders, highlighting how iPSCs provide a unique platform for detailed pathological modeling and pharmacological testing, driving forward precision medicine and drug discovery. Concurrently, CRISPR-Cas9 offers unprecedented precision in gene correction, presenting potential curative therapies that move beyond symptomatic treatment. Therefore, this review examines the transformative role of iPSC technology and CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing in addressing metabolic and genetic disorders such as alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency (A1AD) and glycogen storage disease (GSD), which significantly impact liver and pulmonary health and pose substantial challenges in clinical management. In addition, this review discusses significant achievements alongside persistent challenges such as technical limitations, ethical concerns, and regulatory hurdles. Future directions, including innovations in gene-editing accuracy and therapeutic delivery systems, are emphasized for next-generation therapies that leverage the full potential of iPSC and CRISPR-Cas9 technologies.","Metabolic and genetic disorders, characterized by disturbances in metabolic processes due to defects in the genes that control these processes, represent a significant area of clinical and research concern. Disorders such as alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency (A1AD) and glycogen storage disease type I (GSDI) impair quality of life and pose substantial burdens due to their chronic nature and the complexity of their management. These conditions are primarily inherited and can lead to severe liver and pulmonary diseases, among other complications. Understanding these disorders at a molecular level is crucial for developing effective treatments [<xref rid=""B1-cells-13-01052"" ref-type=""bibr"">1</xref>,<xref rid=""B2-cells-13-01052"" ref-type=""bibr"">2</xref>]. Recent advances in biotechnology, mainly through the development of induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) and CRISPR-Cas9 gene-editing technologies, have revolutionized the approach toward understanding and treating metabolic and genetic disorders. iPSC technology allows for the derivation of patient-specific pluripotent cells that can be differentiated into various cell types, providing a unique model system to study disease mechanisms and test therapeutic interventions in a patient-specific manner. This technology has shown significant potential in drug discovery and personalized medicine, offering insights into the pathophysiology of complex diseases [<xref rid=""B3-cells-13-01052"" ref-type=""bibr"">3</xref>,<xref rid=""B4-cells-13-01052"" ref-type=""bibr"">4</xref>]. CRISPR-Cas9, on the other hand, provides a robust, precise, and relatively simple method for gene editing that can correct genetic defects at the genome level. This approach has been applied successfully in correcting mutations responsible for diseases like A1AD and GSDI, offering hope for curative therapies that address the root cause of the diseases rather than just managing symptoms [<xref rid=""B5-cells-13-01052"" ref-type=""bibr"">5</xref>,<xref rid=""B6-cells-13-01052"" ref-type=""bibr"">6</xref>]. This review aims to assess the current state-of-the-art research and the future directions of A1AD and GSDI, particularly in the context of iPSC and CRISPR-Cas9 technologies. This review interprets recent findings that utilize these technologies to model and treat complex disorders. By examining the latest advancements and challenges, this review seeks to highlight the potential of iPSCs and CRISPR-Cas9 as tools for fundamental research and as pivotal elements in the translational pathway toward clinical applications. Overall, this review provides a comprehensive and updated overview that can aid researchers and clinicians in understanding the evolving landscape of genetic and metabolic disorder treatment for further development of innovative therapeutic solutions in the near future.  Recent advancements in iPSC technology have significantly enhanced the efficiency of reprogramming and the safety of these cells for clinical applications, as well as the creation of disease-specific iPSC lines for diverse disease modeling and drug discovery [<xref rid=""B10-cells-13-01052"" ref-type=""bibr"">10</xref>,<xref rid=""B11-cells-13-01052"" ref-type=""bibr"">11</xref>,<xref rid=""B12-cells-13-01052"" ref-type=""bibr"">12</xref>,<xref rid=""B13-cells-13-01052"" ref-type=""bibr"">13</xref>]. Patient-specific iPSC lines have proven essential in recapitulating the pathobiology of targeted tissues or organs, such as the pancreas, heart, brain, and liver, offering crucial insights into complex diseases [<xref rid=""B13-cells-13-01052"" ref-type=""bibr"">13</xref>,<xref rid=""B14-cells-13-01052"" ref-type=""bibr"">14</xref>,<xref rid=""B15-cells-13-01052"" ref-type=""bibr"">15</xref>]. Significant achievements in using iPSC-derived models to explore the pathophysiology of A1AD and GSDI are highlighted in <xref rid=""cells-13-01052-t002"" ref-type=""table"">Table 2</xref>. For A1AD, iPSCs have been differentiated into hepatocyte-like cells, providing a dynamic model to study the accumulation and pathophysiology of alpha-1 antitrypsin (A1AT) within the liver [<xref rid=""B16-cells-13-01052"" ref-type=""bibr"">16</xref>,<xref rid=""B17-cells-13-01052"" ref-type=""bibr"">17</xref>]. These models facilitate an in-depth understanding of disease progression and response to therapies, closely mimicking the liver’s cellular environment. This close simulation allows for detailed observations of A1AT protein behavior and its impacts on liver function. In the case of GSDI, iPSCs have been instrumental in creating liver and kidney cell models that replicate the disease’s metabolic effects, particularly the dysfunctional processes of glycogenolysis and gluconeogenesis [<xref rid=""B9-cells-13-01052"" ref-type=""bibr"">9</xref>,<xref rid=""B18-cells-13-01052"" ref-type=""bibr"">18</xref>]. Three iPSC lines have been generated through reprogramming skin fibroblasts from three glycogen storage disease type III (GSDIII) patients [<xref rid=""B19-cells-13-01052"" ref-type=""bibr"">19</xref>]. These patient-derived iPSC lines are expected to be pivotal platforms for modeling GSDIII in vitro to study its pathological mechanisms and potential treatments. They can also be used for testing gene-editing tools and new pharmacological agents, enhancing the development of targeted therapeutic strategies. CRISPR-Cas9 is a groundbreaking genome-editing platform that has revolutionized the field of genetics by enabling precise modifications at specific locations in the genome of virtually any organism. Derived from a naturally occurring genome defense mechanism in bacteria, this technology utilizes a synthetic guide RNA (gRNA) to direct the Cas9 nuclease to a specific DNA sequence. The Cas9 enzyme then introduces a double-stranded break at the targeted location, which can be manipulated to either disrupt a gene, correct a mutation, or insert new genetic material [<xref rid=""B45-cells-13-01052"" ref-type=""bibr"">45</xref>]. This mechanism leverages the cell’s inherent DNA repair processes, primarily through non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) or homology-directed repair (HDR), to achieve the desired genetic alteration. NHEJ can introduce small deletions or insertions that disrupt gene function, which is helpful for gene knockout studies. In contrast, HDR, used in the presence of a donor DNA template, allows for precise gene correction or insertion, ideal for therapeutic applications [<xref rid=""B6-cells-13-01052"" ref-type=""bibr"">6</xref>,<xref rid=""B45-cells-13-01052"" ref-type=""bibr"">45</xref>]. Another advanced technology in genome editing is the development of variant Cas9 proteins that permit single-base editing and avoid double-strand break (DSB) events. These variant Cas9 proteins include Cas9 nickase (nCas9), which produces a single-stranded break rather than a DSB, or catalytically inactive Cas9 proteins such as dCas9, dCas12a, or dCas13b, enabling editing without DSBs [<xref rid=""B25-cells-13-01052"" ref-type=""bibr"">25</xref>]. The base-editing technology contains a cytosine base editor tool for converting C–G to T–A and an adenine base editor tool for shifting A–T to G–C. These are deaminases linked to a variant Cas9 and gRNA to modify a base pair at a specific locus [<xref rid=""B26-cells-13-01052"" ref-type=""bibr"">26</xref>]. With CRISPR base-editing technology, host DSB repair by either NHEJ or HDR is avoided and this allows the editing of a single base precisely without any errors created during DSB repair. Werder et al. employed adenine base editors (mediating A → G) to correct the G-to-A point mutation in the <italic toggle=""yes"">SERPINA1</italic> gene in patient-derived iPSCs. After differentiation of the edited iPSCs to hepatocytes, these derived hepatocytes reduced the aggregation of misfolded A1AT [<xref rid=""B27-cells-13-01052"" ref-type=""bibr"">27</xref>]. Their study showcased how precise genomic editing could correct the point mutation responsible for A1AT misfolding directly in the iPSCs from A1AD patients. This genetic correction led to a significant decrease in polymerized A1AT within the hepatocytes, suggesting a promising direction for gene therapy in A1AD [<xref rid=""B27-cells-13-01052"" ref-type=""bibr"">27</xref>]. Importantly, this study provided proof of concept that targeted gene editing could ameliorate disease phenotypes in patient-derived cellular models. The targeted correction of pathogenic mutations within the <italic toggle=""yes"">SERPINA1</italic> gene using CRISPR-Cas9 technology represents a significant advancement in the treatment of A1AD. The <italic toggle=""yes"">SERPINA1</italic> gene encodes the alpha-1 antitrypsin protein, protecting the lungs from neutrophil elastase damage. Mutations in this gene, such as the PiZ allele, lead to the production of a misfolded alpha-1 antitrypsin protein that accumulates in hepatocytes and significantly reduces its levels in the bloodstream, contributing to lung and liver diseases [<xref rid=""B46-cells-13-01052"" ref-type=""bibr"">46</xref>]. The PiZ allele is characterized by a single point mutation (Glu342Lys) that results in a polymerization-prone protein [<xref rid=""B47-cells-13-01052"" ref-type=""bibr"">47</xref>]. Successful instances of gene editing have been documented where iPSCs derived from patients with A1AD were used as models to perform precise genetic interventions aimed at correcting the PiZ allele [<xref rid=""B48-cells-13-01052"" ref-type=""bibr"">48</xref>]. Researchers have effectively replaced the mutated segment with a healthy copy of the gene by designing gRNA to target this specific mutation and using HDR with a correct DNA template. This correction restores the normal folding and function of the alpha-1 antitrypsin protein [<xref rid=""B27-cells-13-01052"" ref-type=""bibr"">27</xref>]. As illustrated in <xref rid=""cells-13-01052-f001"" ref-type=""fig"">Figure 1</xref>, the CRISPR-Cas9 system was employed to specifically target and correct the PiZ allele mutations in the <italic toggle=""yes"">SERPINA1</italic> gene. The gRNA was designed to align with the mutation site precisely, directing the Cas9 nuclease to induce a DSB at this specific locus within the genome. The use of HDR mechanisms was crucial, as it allowed for the introduction of the correct SERPINA gene sequence via a donor DNA template, effectively replacing the mutated segment with a healthy copy of the gene [<xref rid=""B10-cells-13-01052"" ref-type=""bibr"">10</xref>,<xref rid=""B39-cells-13-01052"" ref-type=""bibr"">39</xref>]. Post editing, the iPSCs showed a restoration of functional A1AT protein levels. The edited iPSCs, differentiated into hepatocyte-like cells, demonstrated the ability to produce A1AT at levels comparable to those observed in healthy individuals. In another study, as a dominant mutation in patients is PiZ <italic toggle=""yes"">SERPINA1</italic> carrying a single G → A mutation, by using an advanced adenine base editor tool in base-editing technology, researchers were able to correct the mutated single base pair from G⋅C to A⋅T [<xref rid=""B46-cells-13-01052"" ref-type=""bibr"">46</xref>]. In vivo experiments with PiZ-transgenic mice demonstrated that these cells exhibited reduced aggregation of the misfolded protein, a critical factor in preventing the hepatocyte and lung damage typically associated with A1AD. This outcome not only signifies a direct therapeutic potential but also enhances our understanding of the disease’s pathophysiology, providing invaluable insights into the mechanisms underlying A1AD and its treatment [<xref rid=""B46-cells-13-01052"" ref-type=""bibr"">46</xref>]. The success of these gene-editing endeavors opens potential pathways for developing targeted gene therapies that could be personalized based on a patient’s genetic profile. Such therapies could potentially offer a permanent solution to A1AD, moving beyond symptomatic treatment to address the root cause of the disease. As we advance our capabilities in gene editing, further refinements in CRISPR-Cas9 technology, such as the development of high-fidelity Cas9 enzymes, are anticipated. These advancements are expected to enhance the precision and reduce off-target effects, significantly improving the safety profile of gene therapies for clinical use [<xref rid=""B6-cells-13-01052"" ref-type=""bibr"">6</xref>]. Despite these promising results, several challenges remain. The variability of iPSC lines due to differences in the genetic background of the donor cells and the reprogramming process can affect the consistency of disease models and therapeutic outcomes. Furthermore, ensuring the long-term stability and integration of corrected genes without off-target effects remains a significant hurdle. These technical and biological challenges necessitate ongoing research and development, as well as comprehensive preclinical and clinical trials to establish the efficacy and safety of the treatments before they can be widely implemented [<xref rid=""B12-cells-13-01052"" ref-type=""bibr"">12</xref>]. Gene editing has emerged as a cornerstone in the therapeutic landscape for GSDI to correct mutations in the <italic toggle=""yes"">G6PC</italic> gene for type Ia and the <italic toggle=""yes"">SLC37A4</italic> gene for type Ib. The gRNA is meticulously designed to pair with the exact sequence of these mutations, ensuring the Cas9 enzyme introduces DSBs precisely at the faulty gene sites. This targeted approach utilizes HDR mechanisms to introduce a correct copy of the gene via a donor template, effectively replacing the defective segment with a healthy version. This correction restores the function of the glucose-6-phosphatase enzyme, which is crucial for the proper metabolic processing of glycogen into glucose [<xref rid=""B37-cells-13-01052"" ref-type=""bibr"">37</xref>,<xref rid=""B38-cells-13-01052"" ref-type=""bibr"">38</xref>]. Arnaoutova and colleagues have demonstrated in vivo correction in a mouse model using CRISPR-Cas9 to specifically target and correct the <italic toggle=""yes"">G6PC-p</italic>. R83C mutation, a prevalent pathogenic variant. The correction of this mutation restored glucose-6-phosphatase activity in liver cells, enabling these cells to manage glycogen breakdown and glucose release effectively, thus reducing glycogen accumulation and the associated organ damage [<xref rid=""B38-cells-13-01052"" ref-type=""bibr"">38</xref>]. Furthermore, Skakic et al. reported on using CRISPR-Cas9 in iPSCs derived from GSDIb patients. These iPSCs were edited to correct the <italic toggle=""yes"">G6PC</italic> mutation and differentiated into hepatocyte-like cells. The edited cells exhibited restored functionality of glucose-6-phosphatase, as evidenced by their ability to perform gluconeogenesis and glycogenolysis effectively. Post-editing metabolic assays confirmed the normalized metabolic pathways in these cells, alongside their ability to maintain stable blood glucose levels under fasting conditions [<xref rid=""B49-cells-13-01052"" ref-type=""bibr"">49</xref>]. Rutten and colleagues generated a hepatocytic GSDIa mouse model via CRISPR-Cas9 and characterized the effects of G6PC on glucose metabolism and liver functions [<xref rid=""B50-cells-13-01052"" ref-type=""bibr"">50</xref>]. Their study revealed that genome-edited mouse models allow for the modeling of a variety of GSDIa phenotypes [<xref rid=""B50-cells-13-01052"" ref-type=""bibr"">50</xref>]. Rossiaud and colleagues expanded on this work by highlighting the role of iPSC technology in modeling disease pathology and testing gene therapy approaches in vitro. They detailed how genetically corrected hepatocytes derived from iPSCs of GSDIII patients could be used to study the disease mechanisms and the efficacy of new gene therapy protocols in a controlled environment, thus providing valuable insights before clinical application [<xref rid=""B19-cells-13-01052"" ref-type=""bibr"">19</xref>]. These advancements in gene editing for GSDI open new avenues for treatment beyond dietary management and symptomatic care. By addressing the root cause of metabolic dysfunctions, gene therapy offers a potential for lasting remedies that could significantly enhance the quality of life and reduce the burden of disease management. As gene-editing techniques evolve, particularly with advances in delivery mechanisms and editing efficiency, the prospect of applying these therapies in clinical settings becomes increasingly feasible. Future clinical trials will be crucial in evaluating the safety, efficacy, and long-term benefits of these treatments [<xref rid=""B43-cells-13-01052"" ref-type=""bibr"">43</xref>,<xref rid=""B50-cells-13-01052"" ref-type=""bibr"">50</xref>]. Despite these advancements, the application of gene editing in GSDI faces several challenges. Variability in gene correction efficiency across different iPSC lines and the potential for off-target effects remain significant concerns. Ensuring the precision and stability of gene edits is paramount to prevent unintended consequences and guarantee therapeutic efficacy. Furthermore, the scalability of these technologies for widespread clinical use requires ongoing innovation and rigorous regulatory scrutiny to ensure that treatments can be delivered safely and effectively [<xref rid=""B49-cells-13-01052"" ref-type=""bibr"">49</xref>,<xref rid=""B51-cells-13-01052"" ref-type=""bibr"">51</xref>]. The complexity of disease phenotypes hinders the accurate modeling of diseases via editing genes. Modeling diseases using iPSCs often encounters the complexity of replicating the multifaceted nature of diseases, especially those with complex genetic and environmental interactions. Diseases like A1AD and GSDI involve multiple organ systems and biochemical pathways, which can be challenging to replicate in iPSC-derived models accurately. This complexity can lead to models that do not fully capture the disease phenotype or its progression [<xref rid=""B52-cells-13-01052"" ref-type=""bibr"">52</xref>]. On the other hand, while CRISPR-Cas9 offers revolutionary precision in gene editing, several technical challenges persist. Off-target effects, where CRISPR-Cas9 inadvertently edits genes other than the intended targets, can lead to unintended consequences and complicate the interpretation of experimental results. Furthermore, the site-specific editing efficiency, crucial for precise gene correction, is naturally low in many cell types, which limits the applications of corrective gene editing [<xref rid=""B6-cells-13-01052"" ref-type=""bibr"">6</xref>,<xref rid=""B45-cells-13-01052"" ref-type=""bibr"">45</xref>,<xref rid=""B53-cells-13-01052"" ref-type=""bibr"">53</xref>]. Furthermore, variability in iPSC lines, due to differences in the genetic background of the donor cells and the reprogramming process, can affect the consistency of disease models and therapeutic outcomes. Moreover, scaling up iPSC technologies for clinical applications poses significant challenges, including maintaining cell quality and ensuring standardized protocols across different batches of cells [<xref rid=""B12-cells-13-01052"" ref-type=""bibr"">12</xref>]. Using iPSC and CRISPR-Cas9 technologies raises several ethical issues, particularly concerning germline editing, which can affect future generations. The potential for creating “designer babies” with selected traits has sparked intense ethical debates. Moreover, the use of CRISPR-Cas9 in embryos and reproductive cells is subject to stringent ethical scrutiny to prevent possible misuse [<xref rid=""B44-cells-13-01052"" ref-type=""bibr"">44</xref>]. However, these ethical issues are of less concern in the treatment of these debilitating genetic diseases. Regulatory frameworks for gene-editing therapies are still in development, with significant variations between countries. The approval process for therapies developed using CRISPR-Cas9 and iPSCs can be lengthy and complex, involving multiple stages of clinical trials to ensure safety and efficacy. Regulatory agencies like the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the European Medicines Agency (EMA) are actively working to establish guidelines that address both the scientific aspects of these therapies and their ethical implications [<xref rid=""B54-cells-13-01052"" ref-type=""bibr"">54</xref>]. In addition, using human cells for iPSC generation involves considerations regarding consent and privacy. Donors must be fully informed about how their cells will be used, the potential for commercialization, and the privacy measures taken to protect their genetic information. Ensuring transparent consent processes is crucial for ethical compliance and public trust [<xref rid=""B51-cells-13-01052"" ref-type=""bibr"">51</xref>]. Integrating CRISPR-Cas9 genome-editing technologies with iPSC platforms heralds a transformative era in precision medicine. This shows extraordinary potential for the treatment of metabolic and genetic disorders such as GSDI and A1AD. CRISPR-Cas9’s precision in targeting specific genetic anomalies presents a promising avenue for directly addressing the genetic bases of these diseases, while iPSCs facilitate the development of patient-specific organoid models, revolutionizing drug screening and disease modeling. Recent advancements such as the development of liver organoids from iPSCs that accurately mimic the disease phenotype of A1AD demonstrate the potential of these technologies to revolutionize therapeutic strategies [<xref rid=""B17-cells-13-01052"" ref-type=""bibr"">17</xref>,<xref rid=""B31-cells-13-01052"" ref-type=""bibr"">31</xref>,<xref rid=""B55-cells-13-01052"" ref-type=""bibr"">55</xref>]. Moreover, CRISPR-Cas9 has been utilized to correct mutations directly associated with A1AD or GSDI in patient-derived iPSCs, setting the stage for these cells to be differentiated into functional tissue for transplantation without the ethical and immunological complications associated with traditional stem cell therapies [<xref rid=""B34-cells-13-01052"" ref-type=""bibr"">34</xref>,<xref rid=""B50-cells-13-01052"" ref-type=""bibr"">50</xref>,<xref rid=""B56-cells-13-01052"" ref-type=""bibr"">56</xref>]. Despite these advancements, the clinical application of these technologies faces significant challenges, primarily concerning safe and effective delivery mechanisms. Research into various vectors for CRISPR-Cas9 delivery has underscored the need for a balance between efficacy and safety, particularly in reducing off-target effects that could lead to unintended genetic consequences [<xref rid=""B51-cells-13-01052"" ref-type=""bibr"">51</xref>,<xref rid=""B57-cells-13-01052"" ref-type=""bibr"">57</xref>]. Similarly, the complexity of mimicking exact physiological conditions within iPSC-derived organoids remains a significant hurdle, crucial for accurate disease modeling and therapeutic development [<xref rid=""B58-cells-13-01052"" ref-type=""bibr"">58</xref>]. Furthermore, the path from laboratory models to clinical applications involves intricate technological, regulatory, and ethical considerations. Rigorous clinical trials are needed to validate the efficacy and safety of these technologies. Additionally, comprehensive regulatory frameworks and ethical guidelines must be refined to ensure these innovations translate safely from the test bench to the bedside. This includes addressing potential issues related to genetic privacy, germline modifications, and the implications of creating genetically altered human cells. Additionally, interdisciplinary collaborations across fields such as bioinformatics, genetic counseling, and regulatory sciences will be essential in addressing these challenges. Such collaborations can lead to innovative solutions that harness the full potential of iPSC and CRISPR-Cas9 technologies, facilitating their transition into mainstream clinical practices. Overall, the integration of CRISPR-Cas9 and iPSC technologies holds tremendous promise for treating diseases like GSDI and A1AD. However, the certainty of these future directions is hindered by significant obstacles that must be overcome. Through the concerted efforts of scientists, clinicians, ethicists, and policymakers, the full potential of these groundbreaking technologies can be realized, leading to more effective and personalized therapeutic options for patients with genetic and metabolic disorders. The integration of iPSC and CRISPR-Cas9 technologies has revolutionized the field of biomedical research, particularly in the study and treatment of complex and rare metabolic and genetic disorders such as A1AD and GSDI. This review has highlighted significant advancements in and the transformative potential of these technologies for modeling diseases, correcting genetic anomalies, and paving the way for innovative therapeutic solutions. iPSC technology has enhanced our ability to model diseases accurately and tailor treatments to individual genetic profiles. These models provide crucial insights into disease pathophysiology and assist in optimizing pharmacological therapies. Similarly, CRISPR-Cas9 offers unprecedented precision in gene editing, providing robust frameworks for studying and directly correcting genetic defects at their source. However, these advancements come with significant challenges. Technical issues such as ensuring the fidelity and safety of gene edits, overcoming the variability of iPSC lines, and scaling up for clinical applications are formidable. Moreover, ethical and regulatory considerations must be meticulously navigated to ensure patient safety, particularly concerning potential off-target effects and germline editing implications. The path forward will require continued innovation and an interdisciplinary approach to overcome these hurdles. Enhancing the precision of gene editing, improving the efficiency of iPSC derivation and differentiation, and addressing regulatory and ethical challenges will be crucial. This collaborative effort across scientific, regulatory, and ethical domains is essential for realizing the full potential of these technologies in treating A1AD, GSDI, and other genetic disorders. In conclusion, while significant obstacles remain, the potential of iPSCs and CRISPR-Cas9 to fundamentally transform the landscape of disease modeling and gene therapy is immense. The ongoing research and development are not merely academic exercises but are paving the way for future therapeutic breakthroughs that could revolutionize medicine.",N/A,18 6 2024
Prevalence of alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency in patients with acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease: Insights from a prospective study,,"Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), typified by persistent respiratory symptoms and airflow limitation, continues to impart substantial global morbidity and mortality.[<xref rid=""R1"" ref-type=""bibr"">1</xref>] Imbalanced lung protease-antiprotease activity, namely, unrestrained neutrophil elastases degrading extracellular matrix, drives COPD pathogenesis.[<xref rid=""R2"" ref-type=""bibr"">2</xref>] The serine protease inhibitor alpha-1 antitrypsin (AAT) plays a key neutralizing role, with genetically determined dysfunction resulting in reduced circulating levels and increased COPD susceptibility.[<xref rid=""R3"" ref-type=""bibr"">3</xref>] Multiple studies demonstrate that selective screening in COPD cohorts aids the identification of patients with concomitant AAT deficiency.[<xref rid=""R4"" ref-type=""bibr"">4</xref><xref rid=""R5"" ref-type=""bibr"">5</xref><xref rid=""R6"" ref-type=""bibr"">6</xref>] Specifically assessing alpha-1 globulin phenotypes highlights at-risk individuals otherwise underrecognized by routine testing.[<xref rid=""R7"" ref-type=""bibr"">7</xref><xref rid=""R8"" ref-type=""bibr"">8</xref>] However, data among Indian COPD populations is scarce, especially concerning acute exacerbations that accelerate pulmonary deterioration.[<xref rid=""R9"" ref-type=""bibr"">9</xref><xref rid=""R10"" ref-type=""bibr"">10</xref>] This prospective analysis aimed to determine the prevalence of AAT deficiency alongside associated biomarkers among acutely exacerbated COPD patients hospitalized in Kerala, India. In this prospective study conducted at Kims Al Shifa Hospital in Kerala, India from June 2016 to February 2018, a cohort of 106 patients with COPD hospitalized for acute exacerbations were enrolled after obtaining informed consent. Known AAT deficiency patients were excluded. Approved by Institutional Ethics committee of Al Shifa Hospital, Perinthalmanna Date 10, May 2016. Fully automated serum AAT level quantification (g/L) utilized an immunoturbidimetric assay measured on a Cobas c501 system (Roche Diagnostics). C-reactive protein (CRP) was evaluated by latex turbidimetric immunoassay. Statistical analysis was performed using Student’s <italic toggle=""yes"">t</italic> test to compare AAT between COPD and controls; Pearson’s correlation analysis evaluated relationships of AAT with CRP and postbronchodilator pulmonary function test parameters. The mean serum AAT was 1.48 ± 0.27 g/L (range = 1.02–2.50 g/L) in patients with COPD during acute exacerbations. AAT and CRP levels were significantly elevated compared with baseline stable COPD (<italic toggle=""yes"">P</italic> < 0.001). No patients met the AAT deficiency threshold of <0.8 g/L, confirming zero prevalence in this population-based sample.

Posttransplant Lymphoproliferative Disorder in a Patient With Alpha-1 Antitrypsin Deficiency: A Case Report,"A 13-year-old male with a past medical history of receiving a whole liver transplant secondary to alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency (AATD) with subsequent inferior vena cava thrombosis nine years prior presented to the emergency department with abdominal distension, shortness of breath, coughing, and left superficial cervical lymphadenopathy. He had seen his pediatrician the day before where he tested negative for group A <italic toggle=""yes"">Streptococcus</italic>, influenza, and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2. Additionally, the patient reported having elevated liver function tests noted from the results of lab tests taken earlier that day. The patient was admitted to the hospital. While at the hospital, a lymph node biopsy was performed, and pathology from that biopsy revealed infectious mononucleosis-like nondestructive posttransplant lymphoproliferative disorder (PTLD). Due to the patient's liver transplant nine years prior, the patient was on an immunosuppressant medication: tacrolimus 2 mg. To treat the PTLD, the tacrolimus was reduced, then stopped, and then subsequently restarted at 1 mg. He also was given ganciclovir and prednisone. Two months after recovering from the PTLD, the patient’s Epstein-Barr-virus (EBV) viral load continued to fluctuate, and he was treated with three doses of the monoclonal antibody drug rituximab. After treatment with rituximab, his EBV viral load remained stable. This case report gives insight into the treatment of PTLD and can serve as a reminder to be aware of the possibility of PTLD in a pediatric patient with AATD multiple years after a transplant.","Posttransplant lymphoproliferative disorders (PTLDs) are a collection of life-threatening complications that involve uncontrolled proliferation of lymphoid cells as a consequence of extrinsic immunosuppression after organ or hematopoietic stem cell transplantation [<xref rid=""REF1"" ref-type=""bibr"">1</xref>]. PTLD has most commonly been associated with Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) [<xref rid=""REF1"" ref-type=""bibr"">1</xref>,<xref rid=""REF2"" ref-type=""bibr"">2</xref>]. For transplant recipients who use immunosuppressive drugs, their EBV-specific cytotoxic t-cell response is suppressed [<xref rid=""REF3"" ref-type=""bibr"">3</xref>]. This puts these patients at a higher risk of developing EBV. The incidence of PTLD in patients with a previous transplant is estimated to be 1-33% [<xref rid=""REF3"" ref-type=""bibr"">3</xref>]. There are two peaks of PTLD incidence that have been noted [<xref rid=""REF4"" ref-type=""bibr"">4</xref>]. The first, more common peak is in the first posttransplant year (mostly EBV seropositive), and the second peak is between the fifth and 15th year after transplant (mostly EBV seronegative) [<xref rid=""REF4"" ref-type=""bibr"">4</xref>]. Interestingly, primary EBV infection is the most common cause for PTLD development in pediatric patients [<xref rid=""REF4"" ref-type=""bibr"">4</xref>]. There appears to be an increased risk of PTLD seen in young recipients, presumably due to the high percentage who are EBV naive at transplantation, leaving them susceptible to primary infection [<xref rid=""REF5"" ref-type=""bibr"">5</xref>]. However, for adults, the first year after transplantation is when the incidence is highest [<xref rid=""REF6"" ref-type=""bibr"">6</xref>]. This case will discuss the complications of PTLD in a pediatric patient with alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency (AATD) who received a liver transplant nine years prior to the onset of PTLD. AATD is an autosomal recessive disorder marked by very low levels of alpha-1 antitrypsin [<xref rid=""REF7"" ref-type=""bibr"">7</xref>]. It is one of the most common genetic disorders of the Caucasian population [<xref rid=""REF8"" ref-type=""bibr"">8</xref>]. Patients usually present in early infancy with liver disease or emphysema in adulthood [<xref rid=""REF8"" ref-type=""bibr"">8</xref>]. The explanation for the liver disease relates to the fact that hepatocytes are the main location of alpha-1 antitrypsin production and that mutations of the alpha-1 antitrypsin gene cause errors in the processing of alpha-1 antitrypsin, resulting in hepatocyte injury [<xref rid=""REF9"" ref-type=""bibr"">9</xref>,<xref rid=""REF10"" ref-type=""bibr"">10</xref>]. The most common symptoms of PTLDs include fever, chills, weight loss, fatigue, and lymphadenopathy [<xref rid=""REF3"" ref-type=""bibr"">3</xref>]. Some PTLDs present clinically with just nonspecific symptoms, while other types of PTLDs present with symptoms such as lymphadenopathy and hepatosplenomegaly [<xref rid=""REF3"" ref-type=""bibr"">3</xref>]. As PTLD progresses, it can spread to any organ, including bone marrow, liver, spleen, kidney, and even the central nervous system in rare cases [<xref rid=""REF3"" ref-type=""bibr"">3</xref>]. Histological examination of tumor tissue is the gold standard for PTLD diagnosis. Furthermore, an excisional biopsy or resection of a whole lymph node is preferred over a core needle biopsy [<xref rid=""REF3"" ref-type=""bibr"">3</xref>]. According to the World Health Organization (WHO) 2017 classification, PTLD can be categorized as either nondestructive PTLDs (plasmacytic hyperplasia, florid follicular hyperplasia, infectious mononucleosis-like PTLD), polymorphic PTLD, monomorphic PTLD (B-cell, T-cell, natural killer cell types), or classic Hodgkin's lymphoma-like PTLD [<xref rid=""REF4"" ref-type=""bibr"">4</xref>]. The Children’s Hospital of Pittsburgh recommends that the first step to treat a pediatric transplant recipient with EBV-related PTLD should be to stop immunosuppressant drugs, initiate ganciclovir or CytoGam® (Kamada Therapeutics), and monitor liver function tests and quantitative EBV polymerase chain reaction (PCR) results [<xref rid=""REF11"" ref-type=""bibr"">11</xref>]. In addition, rituximab can be used to treat PTLD [<xref rid=""REF3"" ref-type=""bibr"">3</xref>]. It is important to note that the effectiveness of rituximab is usually lost if it is used for an extended period of time [<xref rid=""REF3"" ref-type=""bibr"">3</xref>]. Consequently, it is recommended that rituximab use should be limited to once weekly for up to four doses [<xref rid=""REF3"" ref-type=""bibr"">3</xref>]. Once the patient recovers, there is no clear consensus on what preventative measures should be taken [<xref rid=""REF11"" ref-type=""bibr"">11</xref>]. According to the Children's Hospital of Pittsburgh, it is common for patients to note rebound increases in their EBV viral load after recovery from PTLD [<xref rid=""REF11"" ref-type=""bibr"">11</xref>]. A portion of the rebounds appeared to correlate with the reintroduction of immunosuppressant drugs [<xref rid=""REF11"" ref-type=""bibr"">11</xref>]. These rebounds have rarely been associated with evidence of recurrence of EBV-related PTLD in patients treated at the Children’s Hospital of Pittsburgh [<xref rid=""REF11"" ref-type=""bibr"">11</xref>]. Since the frequency of rebound is remarkably high and the rate of actual recurrent PTLD is considerably low, it is not required to routinely monitor the EBV viral load after recovering from PTLD [<xref rid=""REF11"" ref-type=""bibr"">11</xref>]. However, other studies have found monitoring the viral load beneficial. Data from the pediatric field of liver transplantation have found that monitoring EBV viremia can allow practitioners to reduce immunosuppressants and prevent diagnosis of PTLD [<xref rid=""REF12"" ref-type=""bibr"">12</xref>]. Again, there is no clear consensus on a correct management plan to prevent the redevelopment of PTLD [<xref rid=""REF11"" ref-type=""bibr"">11</xref>], so treatment should be carefully decided on a case-by-case basis. A 13-year-old male presented to the emergency department of a pediatric hospital with a chief complaint of fever, swollen lymph nodes, and elevated liver function tests. Additionally, he complained of dyspnea, cough, back pain, and abdominal swelling. The patient had a past medical history of having a whole liver transplant with the Roux-en-Y technique at the age of four, secondary to AATD with subsequent inferior vena cava thrombosis. The patient's mother reported that the patient’s fever started one day ago and reached a maximum of 101.7°F. He was seen at his pediatrician’s office the day before, where he tested negative for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, influenza, and group A <italic toggle=""yes"">Streptococcus</italic>. The patient’s mother also reported that his liver transplant team’s nurse practitioner ordered lab tests to be drawn. These tests revealed elevated liver function tests. The patient denied any trauma or injury to his back, vomiting, diarrhea, dysuria, or sinus congestion. He reported that he was diagnosed with the flu two weeks ago and noted swollen lymph nodes on the left side of the neck at the beginning of the viral illness and an increase in swelling over the last two weeks. The patient’s current medications included cetirizine 10 mg oral tablet taken once daily, ondansetron 4 mg oral tablet taken as needed for nausea or vomiting, tacrolimus 2 mg taken once a day, and rizatriptan 10 mg taken as needed at headache onset. On the physical exam, the patient was well-appearing, nontoxic, interactive, and in no distress. Left superficial posterior cervical lymphadenopathy with no tenderness to palpation was noted. His lungs were clear to auscultation bilaterally. Tachypnea, tachycardia, bilateral costovertebral angle tenderness, right upper quadrant tenderness to palpation, and abdominal distention were noted on physical exam. No organomegaly was noted on the physical exam. The findings were concerning for PTLD due to the lymphadenopathy, constitutional symptoms, and history of transplantation. The findings were also concerning for solid organ transplant rejection and viral illness. Due to these differential diagnoses, the patient was considered high risk and was admitted to the hospital. On the first day of admission, the patient was treated empirically with antibiotics, (piperacillin and tazobactam), along with intravenous fluids for acute kidney injury. A hematologist/oncologist, transplant surgeon, and otorhinolaryngologist (for posterior cervical lymphadenopathy) were consulted. The following morning, piperacillin and tazobactam were discontinued and transitioned to ciprofloxacin and metronidazole due to the nephrotoxicity of piperacillin and tazobactam. A computed tomography (CT) of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis showed bilateral pleural effusions, trace pericardial effusion, splenomegaly, and pelvic predominant ascites. By the third morning, the patient's EBV viral load was elevated at 17,580 international units; therefore, he was started on ganciclovir. On the fourth day, the patient’s tacrolimus levels were found to be elevated. Due to this, the tacrolimus dose was reduced from 2 mg to 1 mg. Additionally, a CT head with contrast was performed to evaluate and plan for posterior cervical lymph node excisional biopsy. By the fifth day, the patient received one unit of platelets. Next, interventional radiology completed a liver biopsy and a thoracentesis, removing 1 liter of fluid. While still in the same operating room, a left posterior cervical lymph node was surgically excised and biopsied by the otorhinolaryngologist. After the procedures, the patient received furosemide and albumin. Tacrolimus was held due to continued elevated tacrolimus levels. By the end of the sixth day, the patient was able to restart 1 mg tacrolimus, and the tacrolimus levels were monitored throughout the rest of his admission. On the eighth day, the patient was started on oral clindamycin for phlebitis of the right antecubital IV site where IV ganciclovir was infused. He was transitioned to oral ganciclovir. On the ninth day, a positron emission tomography scan was obtained, revealing no lymphadenopathy. Also, pathology from the lymph node biopsy was consistent with infectious mononucleosis-like nondestructive PTLD. His liver biopsy showed portal and sinusoidal inflammation with features of endotheliitis and bile duct damage. The findings from the liver biopsy were ruled to either be due to acute rejection or due to primary EBV infection. The patient was continued on oral clindamycin and oral ganciclovir. He was started on prednisone 40 mg daily. On the eleventh day, he was deemed medically stable for discharge. He was discharged from the hospital to his home with instructions to continue clindamycin, take ganciclovir for an additional seven days, and continue to take and taper prednisone. He was also given instructions to follow up with the hematologist/oncologist and his transplant team as an outpatient. The patient continued to have frequent lab and clinic visits while on the oral steroid taper. His EBV viremia continued to fluctuate. His hematologist/oncologist treated him with rituximab since his EBV viremia continued to vary. He received rituximab once weekly for a total of three doses, and his EBV viral load has remained stable.  The patient was seen by his pediatrician approximately 17 months after his original presentation with PTLD. The patient reports that he is still taking 1 mg of tacrolimus and his transplant team is continuing to monitor his liver function tests and quantitative EBV PCR results every one to two months. A summarized timeline of the patient's treatment regimen can be seen in the figure.  In this case, PTLD occurred in a patient with AATD, nine years posttransplant. AATD is one of the most common genetic disorders in the Caucasian population [<xref rid=""REF8"" ref-type=""bibr"">8</xref>], yet there appears to be sparse scholarly articles on the association of PTLD and AATD. This case is likely not the only co-occurrence of PTLD and AATD, due to the prevalence of transplantation in AATD and the rise of PTLD [<xref rid=""REF4"" ref-type=""bibr"">4</xref>]. This case provides an example for likely future similar cases. As stated earlier, there are two peaks of incidence of PTLD that occur. One is in the first year after transplantation, and one is five to 15 years after transplantation [<xref rid=""REF4"" ref-type=""bibr"">4</xref>]. It is worth noting that this patient did not have the development of PTLD in his first year of transplantation, which is the more common of the two peaks [<xref rid=""REF6"" ref-type=""bibr"">6</xref>]. Instead, this patient developed PTLD in that second peak. Developing PTLD in the second peak was associated with patients who were EBV naive prior to transplantation and subsequently developed a primary EBV infection after transplantation and immunosuppression [<xref rid=""REF4"" ref-type=""bibr"">4</xref>]. Furthermore, the most common cause of PTLD in pediatric patients is primary EBV infections [<xref rid=""REF4"" ref-type=""bibr"">4</xref>]. Therefore, it is likely that this patient was EBV seronegative up until the ninth posttransplant year when he developed the PTLD. As mentioned earlier, PTLDs are classified into different types: nondestructive, polymorphic, monomorphic, and Hodgkin lymphoma-like [<xref rid=""REF4"" ref-type=""bibr"">4</xref>]. In this case, pathology revealed a nondestructive PTLD. This type of PTLD is a more favorable type, and the patient was eventually managed as recommended by stopping his immunosuppressants, starting him on the ganciclovir, and monitoring liver function tests and EBV viral load [<xref rid=""REF11"" ref-type=""bibr"">11</xref>]. However, it is important to note that there was a delay in this care. Due to his health care team being concerned for organ rejection, the immunosuppressant was not reduced and then subsequently stopped until the fourth and fifth day, respectively. This is a common conundrum that practitioners face when treating patients with PTLD: is this acute organ rejection or PTLD? What makes this question even more challenging is the dangerous outcome that could happen with treatment. Stopping immunosuppressant medication carries the risk of transplant rejection. So, practitioners need to be able to rule out acute rejection before treating PTLD. They also must be aware of the risk of developing acute cellular rejection after stopping immunosuppressants. For example, it has been found that adults with PTLD have mortality rates up to 60% [<xref rid=""REF11"" ref-type=""bibr"">11</xref>]. A majority of those deaths were caused by chronic rejection resulting from the reduction of immunosuppressants in the effort to treat PTLD [<xref rid=""REF11"" ref-type=""bibr"">11</xref>]. However, children seem to have a much more successful recovery period from PTLD [<xref rid=""REF11"" ref-type=""bibr"">11</xref>]. The long-term survival rates for pediatric patients with PTLD is between 60% and 100% [<xref rid=""REF11"" ref-type=""bibr"">11</xref>]. They specifically noted death due to rejection being infrequent in these pediatric cases [<xref rid=""REF11"" ref-type=""bibr"">11</xref>]. Despite this hopeful statistic, for many cases of PTLD, deciding on whether to reduce or withdrawal immunosuppressants still proves to be quite complicated. For most cases, treatment must be considered on an individual basis. For example, in one retrospective analysis of 335 pediatric patients with a history of a liver transplant, it was found that immunosuppressant medication could be safely stopped in 19 cases of PTLD. They reported that acute rejection was an acceptable and manageable risk for those individual cases and reported no deaths as a result of this immunosuppression [<xref rid=""REF12"" ref-type=""bibr"">12</xref>]. Similarly for this case, acute rejection was considered a risk but ruled an acceptable and manageable one. Furthermore, as mentioned earlier, the liver biopsy in this case did not rule out acute rejection. The portal and sinusoidal inflammation with features of endotheliitis and bile duct damage was actually ruled to be either due to acute rejection or due to primary EBV infection. While it is common for acute organ rejection to be on practitioner’s differential diagnosis list for PTLD cases, it is not likely that the two will present at the same time due to the contradiction of the two’s existence together: if the patient is on enough immunosuppressant, they will not have organ rejection but could develop PTLD, and if the patient is not on enough immunosuppressants, this will decrease their chance of developing PTLD but increase their chance of acute rejection. So, this raises the next question: did the patient in this case have acute rejection due to the halting of his immunosuppressant? Since the patient’s liver function levels were already elevated prior to admission and stopping the immunosuppressants, it is more likely that the findings from the biopsy were indicative of primary EBV infection, instead. With all that said, the decision to reduce or stop immunosuppressants should be carefully decided on an individual basis. After reducing or stopping immunosuppressant medication, the next step in treating PTLD is adding the antiviral drug, ganciclovir. The patient in this case was not started on ganciclovir until the third day of admission. As for the rituximab, not all patients being treated for PTLD require it [<xref rid=""REF11"" ref-type=""bibr"">11</xref>], but the patient in this case was given rituximab due to rising EBV viral load. In a study of pediatric patients with PTLD, rituximab was found to have a response rate of 65% [<xref rid=""REF11"" ref-type=""bibr"">11</xref>]. The patient’s response in this case report aligns with the majority, as he also had a successful response rate to rituximab. Finally, the last form of treatment for PTLD that the patient received, and continues to receive, is outpatient serial lab tests to monitor his EBV viral load. As mentioned earlier, it is common for EBV PCR results to increase after the resolution of PTLD, but this does not necessarily mean that the need to continue to monitor the EBV viral load is present [<xref rid=""REF11"" ref-type=""bibr"">11</xref>]. The Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia actually recommends against it [<xref rid=""REF11"" ref-type=""bibr"">11</xref>]. On the other hand, other sources have spoken of the benefits of monitoring the viral load, like being able to use the quantitative EBV PCR results to help manage lowering the immunosuppressant dose to prevent the development, or redevelopment, of PTLD [<xref rid=""REF12"" ref-type=""bibr"">12</xref>]. There are no clear guidelines on how to prevent the redevelopment of PTLD [<xref rid=""REF11"" ref-type=""bibr"">11</xref>], and physicians must, once again, use their best judgment and make these decisions on an individual, case-by-case basis. Clearly, the patient in this report had a good response to treatment. This patient’s outcome was similar to patients who also had a nondestructive form of PTLD. This form of PTLD has a great prognosis compared to others [<xref rid=""REF13"" ref-type=""bibr"">13</xref>]. In one more specific study that observed the management of PTLD in pediatric liver transplant recipients who were taking tacrolimus, the long-term survival rate was 78% [<xref rid=""REF13"" ref-type=""bibr"">13</xref>]. Of the patient deaths, most of them were from PTLD itself, and it was emphasized that these PTLD deaths were all advanced cases with multiple sites of PTLD at the time of diagnosis [<xref rid=""REF13"" ref-type=""bibr"">13</xref>].  In this case study, we discussed the diagnosis of PTLD through lymph node biopsy, the treatment of PTLD with the cessation and subsequent lower dosage of immunosuppressants, the use of ganciclovir, prednisone, rituximab, and the follow-up of the patient with serial EBV viral load monitoring. We were able to make note of the possible complications that come with treating PTLD and how this patient’s outcome compared to other pediatric patients in similar circumstances. With this information, we hope that clinicians can be more prepared for the likely occurrence of more pediatric posttransplant patients who present to their doctors with similar symptoms and that clinicians will be more readily equipped to treat them.",N/A,10 6 2024
Alpha-1-Antitrypsin Deficiency in Children—Unmet Needs Concerning the Liver Manifestation,"Objectives: This study aimed to analyse the clinical course of 45 children with severe alpha-1-antitrypsin deficiency (AATD) registered in our clinic to detect possible predictors of poor outcomes. Methods: The clinical and biological data of 45 patients with homozygous or compound heterozygous AATD were analysed. The data were collected retrospectively going back to 2005 and prospectively from May 2020 until October 2021. It was based on questionnaires, laboratory values, sonography, and biopsy findings. Liver disease was classified into four grades depending on the grade of liver disease: mild or no liver disease, moderate disease, severe disease, and liver transplantation. Results: Thirty-nine patients (86.7%) had a Pi*ZZ and five (11.1%) a Pi*SZ genotype. One patient showed a new, not-yet-described compound heterozygous genotype (Pi*Z + Asp95Asn). A total of 66.7% of the cohort showed mild or no liver disease, 20% moderate, and 13.3% severe. AATD was diagnosed in most cases because of liver abnormalities, such as the elevation of transaminases (42.2%). A total of 29.4% of the patients with neonatal icterus prolongatus developed severe liver disease, and 25.7% were born small for their gestational age (SGA). Diseases of the atopic type were reported in 47.4% of the cases. Conclusions: The presence of neonatal icterus prolongatus in the first weeks of life was significantly more likely in severe courses of liver disease (r = 0.371, <italic toggle=""yes"">p</italic> = 0.012). A tendency toward atopic comorbidity in AAT-deficient children needs to be further evaluated.","Alpha-1-antitrypsin deficiency (AATD) is a genetic disorder predominantly characterised by liver and lung afflictions. While metabolic liver disease shows a peak prevalence in early childhood and after the age of 40, lung emphysema is not seen in children with AATD [<xref rid=""B1-children-11-00694"" ref-type=""bibr"">1</xref>,<xref rid=""B2-children-11-00694"" ref-type=""bibr"">2</xref>,<xref rid=""B3-children-11-00694"" ref-type=""bibr"">3</xref>]. The disease is caused by a mutation in the <italic toggle=""yes"">SERPINA1</italic> gene inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern with a co-dominant expression of alleles. The <italic toggle=""yes"">SERPINA1</italic> gene codes the serine proteinase inhibitor alpha-1-antitrypsin (AAT), mainly synthesized by hepatocytes. Nearly 300 different mutations of the <italic toggle=""yes"">SERPINA1</italic> gene have been described [<xref rid=""B4-children-11-00694"" ref-type=""bibr"">4</xref>]. S and Z alleles represent over 95% of the most frequent disease-associated mutations [<xref rid=""B5-children-11-00694"" ref-type=""bibr"">5</xref>]. Europe counts a prevalence of approximately 1:3000 homozygous Glu342Lys-mutated individuals (Pi*ZZ) [<xref rid=""B6-children-11-00694"" ref-type=""bibr"">6</xref>] and 1:1000 compound heterozygote Pi*SZ individuals [<xref rid=""B7-children-11-00694"" ref-type=""bibr"">7</xref>]. A large variability in phenotypic expression in childhood favours a good disease course. This spectrum ranges from asymptomatic cases to transient neonatal cholestasis and may culminate in cirrhosis necessitating liver transplantation (LTx) [<xref rid=""B8-children-11-00694"" ref-type=""bibr"">8</xref>]. The risk for a severe or deadly disease course is challenging to define, as most data originate from tertiary care centres with a selection bias [<xref rid=""B9-children-11-00694"" ref-type=""bibr"">9</xref>,<xref rid=""B10-children-11-00694"" ref-type=""bibr"">10</xref>]. The most valuable data arise from a Swedish epidemiological study from the 1970s identifying 127 patients with Pi*ZZ through the newborn screening of 200,000 children [<xref rid=""B11-children-11-00694"" ref-type=""bibr"">11</xref>,<xref rid=""B12-children-11-00694"" ref-type=""bibr"">12</xref>]. In this unbiased cohort, the risk of childhood cirrhosis-related mortality was reported to be 2–3%. Unfortunately, predicting the individual course of the disease remains elusive, as no reliable predictor of adverse outcomes has emerged thus far. While some studies report on neonatal icterus prolongatus and neonatal cholestasis occurring more frequently in children with severe disease courses, many other factors, such as breastfeeding, gender, age at diagnosis, and more, have failed to correlate with disease progression consistently [<xref rid=""B13-children-11-00694"" ref-type=""bibr"">13</xref>,<xref rid=""B14-children-11-00694"" ref-type=""bibr"">14</xref>,<xref rid=""B15-children-11-00694"" ref-type=""bibr"">15</xref>]. This study aimed to analyse the clinical course of a German cohort of 45 children with homozygous or compound heterozygous AATD who were medically supervised in our clinic to investigate possible predictors of poor outcomes. Forty-five children of all ages with homozygous or compound heterozygous AATD (Pi*ZZ and Pi*SZ-genotypes) were regularly followed up at the Department for Paediatric Gastroenterology and Hepatology at Bonn University Hospital. All paediatric patients for whom homozygous or compound heterozygous AATD (Pi*ZZ, Pi*SZ or Pi*Z + other mutation) was detected before October 2021 were included. The patients were born between 1998 and 2019 and diagnosed with AATD between 2002 and 2020. The data were collected retrospectively from 2005 to May 2020 and prospectively from May 2020 to October 2021. The patients were seen at our clinic annually, bi-annually, or more often depending on the state and progression of their liver disease. The following parameters were included: gender, genotype, age at evaluation, AAT serum level, age at diagnosis, mode of diagnosis, severity of liver disease, imaging data from sonography and biological data from liver biopsy, treatment and age at treatment start, breastfeeding, comorbidities (e.g., disease of atopic type), sibling history, laboratory results, and metric data. As liver biopsy plays a minor role in diagnosing AATD, it was not performed in all patients but only in those who showed progression of liver disease and those listed for liver transplantation. The patients were divided into four groups with different liver disease stages, classified according to the status at the latest check-up. In the case of liver transplantation, the last data before liver transplantation were used. The different states of liver disease are defined in <xref rid=""children-11-00694-t001"" ref-type=""table"">Table 1</xref>. The first group included all patients who underwent liver transplantation due to AATD. To be classified as severe liver disease, one of the following criteria had to be met: liver failure, persistent portal hypertension (PHT), or cirrhosis in biopsy or sonography. “Persistent” was defined as present on at least the last two check-up occasions and with an interval of a maximum of two years between the two measurements. PHT was evidenced by persistent platelets below 150,000/mm<sup>3</sup>, pathological coagulation (change in Quick/INR/Thrombin time, prothrombin time, or factor V), oesophageal varices, ultrasound/doppler ultrasound with portosystemic derivations, or reverse portal flow. Moderate liver disease was defined as persistent abnormal liver enzymes (ALT or GGT ≥ 2 N, more than twice the upper limit of normal) or persistent pathological signs in sonography (hepatomegaly/splenomegaly/liver parenchymal remodelling). The group of mild or no liver disease included all patients who did not meet any of the previous criteria and thus showed the following: absence of persistent PHT or cirrhosis of the liver, normal or almost normal liver biology in sonography, no persistent pathologies, and laboratory results with mildly abnormal or normal liver enzymes (ALT and GGT < 2 N, less than twice the upper limit of normal). This study had to obtain no ethical approval, as only medically relevant data were collected for routine patient care. Questionnaires for detailed medical history were firmly implemented in our patient care and were not created especially for this study. The demographic and genetic characteristics of the studied population are summarised in <xref rid=""children-11-00694-t002"" ref-type=""table"">Table 2</xref>. Most patients have the Pi*ZZ genotype (86.7%), and 11.1% have the Pi*SZ genotype. One patient showed a new, not-yet-described compound heterozygous genotype (Pi*Z + Asp95Asn) with an AAT serum level of 0.6 g/L. Our patients were mainly diagnosed due to liver abnormalities (an elevation of transaminases/coagulation disorder), icterus prolongatus, or familiar screening. A total of 44.7% of the patients developed icterus prolongatus or neonatal cholestasis. Further insights into the characteristics of different liver disease groups are provided in <xref rid=""children-11-00694-t003"" ref-type=""table"">Table 3</xref>. A severe disease course and the necessity for liver transplantation were exclusively observed in patients with the PiZZ genotype. Conversely, patients with PiSZ genotypes predominantly exhibited moderate or mild liver disease. A noteworthy proportion, comprising 64.3% of patients with at least moderate liver disease (groups 1 to 3) and 36.7% of those with mild or no liver involvement (group 4), received their diagnosis within the first year of life. Stepwise multiple linear regression analyses showed that exclusively icterus prolongatus was significantly associated with the development of severe liver disease (r = 0.371, <italic toggle=""yes"">p</italic> = 0.012). Remarkably, 83.3% of children who eventually required liver transplantation or experienced severe liver disease had a history of icterus prolongatus. Nevertheless, only 29.4% of children with neonatal icterus ultimately developed severe liver disease. <xref rid=""children-11-00694-t004"" ref-type=""table"">Table 4</xref> provides a comprehensive overview of the laboratory findings. Liver transplant patients exhibited notably abnormal laboratory values concerning total bilirubin levels, particularly in the period shortly before liver transplantation. Regarding the evolution of laboratory values, of ALT and GGT in particular, many patients with pathological laboratory values demonstrated improvement or even normalisation over time. In the first six months of life, 75.0% (n = 16); at two years, 64.0% (n = 25); at five years, 47.3% (n = 19); and at eight years, 11.8% (n = 17) of the patients were concerned about ALT and GGT exceeding twice the upper limit of normal. Patients needing LTx did not normalise over time, and those with severe liver involvement all had elevated liver enzymes at least until five years of age. Children with moderate or mild/no liver disease were affected to a lesser extent by ALT and GGT exceeding twice the upper limit, with 60% (n = 5) and 71.4% (n = 7) in the first six months of life. A total of 25.7% of the patients were born small for their gestational age. An analysis of z-values from regular body measurements (weight, height, BMI, and head circumference) indicated a weight deficit in children with severe liver disease in the first six months. However, this deficit tended to normalise as the children continued to grow. We confirmed previous reports of neonatal icterus prolongatus/cholestasis as one of the few suspected prognostic factors for poor outcomes [<xref rid=""B16-children-11-00694"" ref-type=""bibr"">16</xref>,<xref rid=""B17-children-11-00694"" ref-type=""bibr"">17</xref>]. No other prognostic factors could be detected in our cohort. To our knowledge, there are no previous data about the reported high frequency of allergic rhino-conjunctivitis or atopic dermatitis in children with severe AATD. We observed a significant link between neonatal icterus prolongatus/cholestasis and the severity of liver disease in our study cohort. Among liver transplant recipients, 100% had experienced neonatal icterus prolongatus/cholestasis. Moreover, this association was also prominent among those with severe liver disease (75%) and moderate liver disease (71%), whereas it was less common among those with mild or no liver disease (28%). Our results align with similar published data, where the incidence of neonatal jaundice in severe liver disease ranged from 75% to 100% [<xref rid=""B11-children-11-00694"" ref-type=""bibr"">11</xref>,<xref rid=""B16-children-11-00694"" ref-type=""bibr"">16</xref>,<xref rid=""B18-children-11-00694"" ref-type=""bibr"">18</xref>]. However, children with neonatal icterus prolongatus/cholestasis will not always progress to a severe disease course. Consistent with reports from other research centres, only 29.4% of individuals in our cohort developed severe liver disease or required liver transplantation [<xref rid=""B16-children-11-00694"" ref-type=""bibr"">16</xref>]. This finding underscores the complexity of using neonatal icterus prolongatus/cholestasis as a singular prognostic factor for AATD-related liver disease. While it is an important marker, its predictive utility should be considered in the context of other clinical and genetic factors to provide a more comprehensive assessment of disease prognosis. This narrows the utility of icterus prolongatus and neonatal cholestasis as a good prognostic factor. Interestingly, in only 11 children (24.4%), icterus prolongatus or neonatal cholestasis led to the diagnosis of AATD, although it was documented in at least 17 (44.7%) children. This finding supports our observation that AATD testing must be performed more on a low-threshold level. Every child with icterus prolongatus for more than three weeks, independent of the bilirubin differentiation, should be tested for AATD. Regarding the laboratory values, an elevation of ALT and GGT exceeding twice the upper limit of normal within the first years of life does not indicate a poor prognosis for liver disease, as most values were normalised over time. Therefore, we agree that the clinical utility of simple AST, ALT, or GGT measures is limited to identifying patients with severe liver disease [<xref rid=""B19-children-11-00694"" ref-type=""bibr"">19</xref>]. Nevertheless, children who ultimately presented with severe liver disease or necessitated liver transplantation exhibited this elevation in ALT and GGT levels from birth. This distinctive observation underscores the notion that while these laboratory values may not be predictive in all cases, they can serve as valuable indicators when combined with other diagnostic modalities, such as sonography. Atopic disease emerged as a notable feature within our cohort, affecting 47.4% of the patients. This manifestation primarily manifested as allergies to pollen or grasses but also encompassed atopic dermatitis and allergic asthma. To contextualise our findings, we referenced national representative, population-based cross-sectional data from the KIGGS study (German Health Interview and Examination Survey for Children and Adolescents), which reported that 22.6% of German children and adolescents in the general population had been diagnosed with at least one physician-confirmed atopic disease [<xref rid=""B20-children-11-00694"" ref-type=""bibr"">20</xref>]. Our data indicate that the prevalence of atopic disease within the AATD cohort exceeded that of the general population. It is worth noting that despite this heightened prevalence, we did not discern any correlation between the degree of liver involvement and the occurrence of atopic disease. Our findings align with prior research. Teckman et al. [<xref rid=""B10-children-11-00694"" ref-type=""bibr"">10</xref>] previously reported a similarly elevated rate of asthma at 14%, while Sveger et al. [<xref rid=""B21-children-11-00694"" ref-type=""bibr"">21</xref>] observed a 10% rate of asthma among AATD patients. Moreover, Hoffmann et al. [<xref rid=""B22-children-11-00694"" ref-type=""bibr"">22</xref>] highlighted a significantly higher incidence of atopic bronchial disease among heterozygote AATD Pi*MZ and Pi*MS individuals. They also discussed the potential pathogenesis underlying the heightened incidence of atopic disease in AATD. One hypothesis revolves around the role of serine proteases in allergen-induced histamine release. Mast cells, containing the serine protease inhibitor AAT, play a pivotal role in this process. It is conceivable that AATD could lead to increased histamine release by disrupting the regulation of serine proteases, thereby contributing to the higher prevalence of atopic disease in individuals with AATD. Eden et al. reported a higher prevalence (48%) of atopic disease and upper airway obstruction among patients with AATD than patients (27%) with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) [<xref rid=""B23-children-11-00694"" ref-type=""bibr"">23</xref>]. This prevalence rate closely approximates the frequency of atopic disease observed within our cohort. Nevertheless, it is important to note that available data on the prevalence of allergic rhino-conjunctivitis or atopic dermatitis in children with severe AATD remain lacking. Ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) was prescribed to 69% of patients in our cohort, closely mirroring the findings of Ruiz et al. in their French cohort [<xref rid=""B16-children-11-00694"" ref-type=""bibr"">16</xref>]. In our cohort, the prescription rate was concordant with the severity of liver disease, with 100% in severe cases and 60% in patients with mild or no liver disease. The French cohort exhibited a similar trend but fewer prescriptions in patients with mild or no liver disease (35%). These findings collectively advocate for a proactive discussion regarding the early initiation of UDCA therapy in every patient diagnosed with AATD. While there is a valid argument for commencing treatment when liver disease progresses, there is also a compelling rationale for considering an early start to enhance the likelihood of a favourable disease course [<xref rid=""B24-children-11-00694"" ref-type=""bibr"">24</xref>]. Supporting this recommendation, Lykavieris et al. [<xref rid=""B25-children-11-00694"" ref-type=""bibr"">25</xref>] reported significant improvements in clinical status and liver test results among patients undergoing UDCA therapy. Although it is important to acknowledge that UDCA may not confer beneficial effects in cases of the most severe liver involvement, the prospect of early intervention remains reasonable. This study has several limitations, including the absence of a control group, which complicates the determination of causal relationships. Additionally, due to the rarity of the disease, the cohort is relatively small, potentially limiting the generalisability of the results. Our cohort sheds light on the significance of neonatal icterus prolongatus and neonatal cholestasis as potential indicators of a severe course of liver disease in AATD. It is essential to recognise that they do not serve as reliable standalone prognostic factors. Indeed, less than one-third of patients with neonatal icterus prolongatus or cholestasis progressed to a severe disease course. The role of laboratory parameters in assessing the disease course is crucial; however, our findings emphasise their limitations in identifying patients with severe liver disease, as these parameters often normalise over time. The intriguing relationship between AATD and atopic diseases suggests a complex interplay that merits in-depth exploration to unravel underlying mechanisms and inform potential therapeutic strategies. Moreover, it is of great importance to determine the pathomechanical reason why neonatal cholestasis often leads to a worse disease course. In this context, the mechanism of action of UDCA in the context of alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency should also be explored to enable its more targeted and effective use.",N/A,06 6 2024

Recombinant Alpha-1 Antitrypsin–Fc Fusion Protein INBRX-101 in Adults With Alpha-1 Antitrypsin Deficiency: A Phase 1 Study
","<bold>Background:</bold> Alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency (AATD) is characterized by low alpha-1 antitrypsin (AAT) levels, predisposing individuals to lung disease. The standard of care, plasma-derived AAT (pdAAT), is delivered as weekly infusions to maintain serum AAT concentrations ≥11µM (≈50% of those in healthy individuals). INBRX-101, a recombinant human AAT-Fc fusion protein, was designed to have a longer half-life and achieve higher AAT levels than pdAAT. <bold>Methods:</bold> In this phase 1 dose-escalation study (N=31), adults with AATD received 1 dose (part 1) or 3 doses (part 2) of 10 (part 1), 40, 80, or 120mg/kg INBRX-101 every 3 weeks (Q3W) via intravenous infusion. The primary endpoint was safety and tolerability. Secondary endpoints were pharmacokinetics (PK), pharmacodynamics (PD), and immunogenicity of INBRX-101. <bold>Results:</bold> INBRX-101 was well tolerated. Most treatment-emergent adverse events were grade ≤2. In part 2 (n=18; each dose, n=6), dose-related increases in serum functional AAT (fAAT) were observed; mean fAAT levels remained above the 21µM target for up to 4 weeks after the final dose in the 120-mg/kg cohort. Antidrug antibodies had no meaningful impact on PK or PD. INBRX-101 was detected in pulmonary epithelial lining fluid (PELF) from all patients assessed (n=11), and PELF fAAT increased after dosing. PK/PD modeling projected steady-state serum fAAT ≥21µM at 120 mg/kg Q3W (average concentration ≈43µM; trough concentration ≈28µM) and Q4W (≈34µM; ≈21µM). <bold>Conclusion:</bold> The favorable safety profile and ability to maintain serum fAAT levels >21µM with extended-interval dosing, support a phase 2 trial evaluating Q3W and Q4W dosing of INBRX-101.",Full text not available in PMC,N/A,2024
Healthcare resource utilization and costs among patients with alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency with liver and/or lung disease: a longitudinal retrospective study in the USA,,"  To our knowledge, the estimated incremental costs of AATD, liver disease, lung disease or both liver and lung disease have not been published previously. In our study, HCRU and healthcare costs in patients with AATD were higher in the presence of liver and/or lung disease than in patients with AATD only or AATD prior to liver or lung disease. Patients in the AATD with liver and lung disease health state had higher all-cause and liver-associated HCRU and healthcare costs than those in the other health states for all parameters examined. Total liver-associated healthcare costs were also higher in the AATD with liver and lung disease health state than in the AATD with liver disease health state, driven by higher inpatient costs. Overall, for patients in the AATD with liver disease and AATD with liver and lung disease health states, liver-associated costs accounted for only a moderate proportion of the all-cause total healthcare costs, which could be related to under-coding for liver disease diagnosis codes. Patients with liver fibrosis or cirrhosis were also not distinguished in this study owing to the lack of available claims data from the IQVIA PharMetrics Plus database and the small sample size of patients with linked laboratory data in the IQVIA AEMR database; patients with cirrhosis and decompensating events may drive higher HCRU and costs than patients with fibrosis who are more likely to be asymptomatic with lower HCRU and costs. All-cause total costs PPY in the AATD with lung disease and AATD with liver and lung disease health states were higher in patients who received augmentation therapy than in those who did not receive augmentation therapy owing to high all-cause pharmacy costs PPY in patients who received augmentation therapy. In patients with AATD, liver-associated costs were lower in patients who received augmentation therapy than in those who did not receive augmentation therapy because of lower inpatient costs in patients who received augmentation therapy. Notably, the sample size of patients who received augmentation therapy was smaller than that of patients who did not receive augmentation therapy (n = 76 vs n = 490), and therefore larger studies are required to confirm these findings. In the AATD with liver disease health state, patients undergoing liver transplantation had considerably higher inpatient and total healthcare costs 1-year post-transplantation than patients who did not undergo liver transplantation. These data are expected considering the substantial inpatient costs associated with liver transplantation, although they are based on a relatively small sample (n = 29 with liver transplant [sum of person-years, 20]; n = 848 without liver transplant [sum of person-years, 2013]). Further research on the long-term liver-associated costs among patients with AATD after liver transplantation is warranted. In this study, patients with AATD had increased HCRU and all-cause costs in the presence of liver and/or lung disease. Both HCRU and healthcare costs were highest in the AATD with liver and lung disease health state. Among patients who received a liver transplant, inpatient and total healthcare costs were substantially higher 1 year after transplantation than among patients who did not undergo liver transplantation. All-cause total cost PPY was higher in patients who received augmentation therapy than in those who did not, largely owing to all-cause pharmacy costs. Limited genotype information in the current study restricted interpretation of HCRU and healthcare costs by genotype. To facilitate future studies, improved documentation of genotype and development of specific diagnosis codes for the identification of patients with AATD with lung and/or liver disease manifestations is required. Therefore, further research on the disease burden among AATD patients with a Pi*ZZ genotype is warranted. ",N/A,2 5 2024
Long-Term SGRQ Stability in a Cohort of Individuals with Alpha-1 Antitrypsin Deficiency-Associated Lung Disease,,"Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a progressive disease with continuous lung function decline due to ongoing exposure to risk factors, persistent airway inflammation, and aging.<xref rid=""cit0001"" ref-type=""bibr"">1</xref> People with alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency (AATD) are predisposed to developing early-onset COPD with typically basilar emphysema, especially when exposed to smoking and other environmental risk factors.<xref rid=""cit0002"" ref-type=""bibr"">2</xref>,<xref rid=""cit0003"" ref-type=""bibr"">3</xref> Because the cardinal symptoms of dyspnea, chronic productive cough, and wheezing do not usually go away, COPD is generally associated with impaired health-related quality of life (HRQoL).

The present study demonstrates stable HRQoL trajectories over time among individuals participating in a health management program for people with AATD-associated lung disease in the United States who are prescribed augmentation therapy. The annual change in the SGRQ total score was well below the minimal clinically important difference (MCID) of 4 points. Previous studies show similar findings in patients with COPD<xref rid=""cit0020"" ref-type=""bibr"">20</xref>,<xref rid=""cit0021"" ref-type=""bibr"">21</xref> and AATD-associated lung disease,<xref rid=""cit0022"" ref-type=""bibr"">22</xref> although other research reports a greater rate of worsening of HRQoL in participants with AATD not on augmentation therapy.<xref rid=""cit0023"" ref-type=""bibr"">23</xref> SGRQ symptoms subscale scores showed slight improvement over time, indicating reduced distress caused by pulmonary symptoms. SGRQ activity subscale scores worsened slowly over time, reflecting the physical activities that cause or are limited by dyspnea. SGRQ impact subscale scores, assessing social and psychological effects of the disease, remained stable Similar changes in SGRQ subscales were previously reported in a group of patients with AATD-associated lung disease not on augmentation therapy.<xref rid=""cit0022"" ref-type=""bibr"">22</xref> These clinically negligible changes in total SGRQ and its subscales over long periods of time suggest that the SGRQ and likely other respiratory-specific quality-of-life tools will not be good measures of therapeutic efficacy in clinical trials in AATD. Whether this is reflective of the slow progression of emphysema that characterizes this disease or the sensitivity of the HRQoL tools employed remains to be defined. However, the other possibility is that disease management may impact SGRQ trajectories in a beneficial direction. An early study by Campos et al and a recent meta-analysis suggest that disease management may influence SGRQ trajectories.<xref rid=""cit0008"" ref-type=""bibr"">8</xref> Campos et al examined changes in SGRQ trajectories before and after the first year in which AlphaNet implemented its disease management program; findings in this smaller cohort of AlphaNet participants showed a slowing in the rate of worsening of the activity subscale score in the first year of disease management.<xref rid=""cit0008"" ref-type=""bibr"">8</xref> In a recent meta-analysis, self-management programs in individuals with COPD showed significant improvements in all aspects of HRQoL, measured by SGRQ, and improved exercise capacity.<xref rid=""cit0024"" ref-type=""bibr"">24</xref> We observed that individuals with worse dyspnea at baseline, reflected by higher mMRC scores, had gradually improved HRQoL over the duration of the observation period. Individuals with no or low levels of dyspnea remained largely stable. Specifically, the SGRQ symptoms subscale showed a lowered burden of pulmonary symptoms and improved health quality across all grades of dyspnea. In this cohort, individuals with AATD-associated lung disease are younger than usual non-AATD-related COPD patients. In fact, almost a quarter of our study population is younger than 50 years at baseline. We observed significantly worse HRQoL perceived by younger participants at the beginning of the observation period. This might be associated with higher quality of life expectations at younger ages or greater self-perceived burden of pulmonary symptoms and associated distress. Indeed, younger individuals in our cohort self-reported a higher degree of disability that dyspnea imposes on daily activities, measured by mMRC. Our findings agree with previous studies that identified a similar inverse relationship between HRQoL and age in people with COPD,<xref rid=""cit0025"" ref-type=""bibr"">25–27</xref> and AATD-associated lung disease.<xref rid=""cit0009"" ref-type=""bibr"">9</xref>,<xref rid=""cit0012"" ref-type=""bibr"">12</xref> However, it is worth noting that other studies have found no association between HRQoL and age in people with COPD.<xref rid=""cit0028"" ref-type=""bibr"">28</xref>,<xref rid=""cit0029"" ref-type=""bibr"">29</xref> Over time, younger participants showed significant improvement in HRQoL, specifically in the symptoms and impact domains. This may be related to the benefits of participation in the health management program on the social and psychological burden of the disease. Specifically, AlphaNet coordinators regularly contact the program participants, coordinate their services, and provide disease-related education and support. Older participants in our study reported better HRQoL at baseline compared to younger individuals. Trajectories of SGRQ total and subscale scores in people over 65 years showed gradual worsening over time, except for the symptoms subscale, which remained stable. The activities subscale showed the greatest increase in older individuals, reflecting the impact of dyspnea on their regular physical activities. This is an important insight since the capacity to perform physical activity is closely linked to an individual’s self-perceived dyspnea burden.<xref rid=""cit0030"" ref-type=""bibr"">30</xref> Indeed, shortness of breath often leads to inactivity and physical deconditioning and impacts mobility. These findings are consistent with a study that found a significant association between dyspnea in people with COPD and the physical health component of HRQoL and a moderate association with a mental health component of HRQoL measured using the SF-36 instrument.<xref rid=""cit0031"" ref-type=""bibr"">31</xref> Other clinical features of COPD, including oxygen use, exacerbation frequency, and cough, are associated with baseline differences in SGRQ, as would be expected. However, we were surprised to see that longitudinal changes in SGRQ and SGRQ subscales were minimal and produced nearly parallel trajectories, as shown in the graphs in <underline><ext-link http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink href=""https://www.dovepress.com/get_supplementary_file.php?f=443183.docx"" ext-link-type=""uri"">Supplementary Figures 1-6</ext-link></underline>. This is unlike usual COPD, in which exacerbations drive decrements in quality of life over time. Further analysis of exacerbations in AATD seems warranted since the impact of disease management may be attenuating the expected SGRQ decline. HRQoL is an important patient-reported measure of respiratory health in AATD-associated lung disease, considering the absence of a cure and the emphasis on disease management. We observed long-term stability in HRQoL and an association between the rate of change in SGRQ and key baseline parameters of COPD severity, such as mMRC, exacerbation frequency, productive cough, and use of oxygen in individuals with AATD-associated lung disease participating in a disease management program.",N/A,10 4 2024
Cardiovascular disease in Alpha 1 antitrypsin deficiency: an observational study assessing the role of neutrophil proteinase activity and the suitability of validated screening tools,,"Alpha 1 Anti-trypsin deficiency (AATD) is a rare, genetic cause of Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) with an emphysema dominant phenotype. It affects between 1 in 2000 to 1 in 5000 individuals [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR1"">1</xref>]. The lung disease associated with AATD is variable but in general, is associated with faster progression and decline in lung physiology compared with non-AATD COPD [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR2"">2</xref>]. The causal association between neutrophil proteinase activity and AATD-associated lung disease is well described [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR3"">3</xref>], and lung disease can be slowed using Alpha 1 Antitrypsin (AAT) augmentation therapy, replacing the deficient anti-proteinase via intravenous infusion [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR2"">2</xref>], [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR4"">4</xref>]. AAT augmentation therapy is not available in all countries, and many patients are managed according to usual COPD guidelines. It is increasingly recognised that patients with AATD also experience other diseases commonly associated with COPD, such as periodontitis [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR5"">5</xref>]. Recognising co-morbidities enables a more holistic approach to patient management and also offers opportunities to identify common biological mechanisms across diseases which might be therapeutically targetable. Cardiovascular Disease (CVD) is a common co-morbidity in non-AATD COPD [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR6"">6</xref>], sharing the risk factors of smoking cigarettes, poverty and a sedentary lifestyle. In non-AATD COPD, CVD can be predicted non-invasively using tools such as the QRISK2® score [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR7"">7</xref>], which is a composite score including age, sex, ethnicity, zip/postcode (as a surrogate marker of social deprivation), smoking status, BMI, the presence of other key CVD-associated co-morbidities (diabetes, hypertension, chronic kidney disease and atrial fibrillation) and CVD in a first degree relative [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR8"">8</xref>]. CVD risk can also be assessed directly using physiological measurements including arterial stiffness. Aortic stiffness reflects the pathological state of central arteries and is associated with coronary artery atheroma burden [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR9"">9</xref>]. It is measured using carotid-femoral (aortic) pulse wave velocity (aPWV) [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR10"">10</xref>]. There is concordance between QRISK2® and arterial stiffness in non-AATD COPD [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR11"">11</xref>], with high QRISK2® being associated with high arterial stiffness. There are also weak relationships between cardiac risk using either score or measure and the severity of lung disease in COPD [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR12"">12</xref>], [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR13"">13</xref>]. It is unclear whether patients with AATD are also at greater risk of CVD than the general population. The potential confounders such as socio-behavioural factors associated with CVD (smoking and poor socioeconomic status) are less prevalent in patients with severe AATD [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR14"">14</xref>] and COPD presents at a younger age enabling the relationship to COPD to be studied with less effect of confounders. The studies available of CVD risk in AATD have provided conflicting results with no mechanism of effect suggested [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR15"">15</xref>]–[<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR20"">20</xref>]. Three small studies have noted that AATD patients have increased aPWV compared to controls [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR16"">16</xref>], [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR21"">21</xref>], [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR22"">22</xref>]. However, a metanalysis of five studies suggested that AATD patients have a lower risk of ischaemic heart disease [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR20"">20</xref>]. The UK Biobank similarly observed that patients with Z allele heterozygosity have a lower risk of cardiovascular disease than wild type although the risk in those with Z allele homozygosity was not described [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR18"">18</xref>]. However, there is a strong rationale for assuming an increased susceptibility to CVD in AATD. The neutrophil proteinases so intrinsically linked with lung disease in AATD are also implicated in CVD, associated with impaired microvascular perfusion, left ventricular dilatation and adverse cardiac events [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR23"">23</xref>]. Proteinase 3 (a neutrophil proteinase) is increased acutely and predicts outcomes following myocardial damage [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR23"">23</xref>], [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR24"">24</xref>] and is associated with general cardiovascular risk [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR25"">25</xref>]. Because of AAT deficiency neutrophil proteinases may also contribute to both lung and CVD disease. Were this the case, any relationships would be most apparent in AATD patients who were not receiving AAT augmentation therapy, as neutrophil proteinase activity is much higher in AATD compared to non-AATD COPD [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR26"">26</xref>] and AAT augmentation therapy reduces neutrophil proteinase activity [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR27"">27</xref>]. Additionally, were neutrophil proteinases more implicated in the pathogenesis of CVD in AATD than classical risk factors (such as smoking, poverty and certain conditions such as diabetes), standard screening tools such as QRISK2® maybe less able to detect CVD risk in this rare disease. We hypothesised that CVD risk would be elevated in AATD compared to healthy controls and non-AATD COPD, but less detected using the standard screening tool, QRISK2®. Further, the elevated CVD risk in AATD would be associated with unopposed neutrophilic inflammation in AATD, with relationships between CVD, lung disease and neutrophil proteinase activity. The purpose of the present study was threefold. First, to investigate the risk of CVD in a cohort of never-augmented AATD patients, non-AATD COPD and healthy controls using both a calculated risk score (QRISK2®<bold>)</bold> and aPWV, including which aspects of the composite scoring for QRISK2® contributed to risk in each group. Second, to determine the relationships between CVD risk measures and lung physiology in patients with AATD. Third, to determine if proteinase 3 activity was associated with CVD risk in patients with AATD.  The current paper highlights four important points. First, CVD risk, as measured using the physiological marker of arterial stiffness, and adjusted for smoking status, sex and age, is increased in AATD compared with non-AATD COPD or healthy controls. Second, unlike patients with non-AATD COPD and HC, there was significant difference in CVD risk assessment using aPWV and QRISK2<bold>®</bold> in AATD<bold>.</bold> This discordance was not seen in HC or patients with non-AATD COPD. This questions whether QRISK2® is the right risk assessment tool if used in isolation in AATD. The longitudinal assessment of CVD in the current study also supports this, with AATD patients who went on to develop CVD being younger, having smoked less and having a lower QRISK2<bold>®</bold> than healthy controls or patients with non-AATD COPD. Third, there were relationships between aPWV and K<sub>CO</sub> and FEV<sub>1</sub> in AATD, which persisted after adjusting for age and smoking status. This supports the concept of shared processes contributing to both lung disease and arterial stiffness in AATD. Fourth, as expected, proteinase 3 activity, intrinsically linked with lung damage in AATD [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR28"">28</xref>], was highest in AATD. Furthermore, proteinase 3 activity was also associated with aPWV in AATD, even following adjustment for traditional CVD risk factors. There were relationships between proteinase 3 activity and aPWV, which remained in a multi-variate regression model which included age, smoking status, and QRISK2® score. This provides evidence to support a potentially causative association between CVD and neutrophil proteinases in AATD. The QRISK2® score adjusts for traditional risk factors for CVD and was on average lowest in patients with AATD compared with non-AATD COPD and HC, while the age and smoking adjusted aPWV was highest in the AATD cohort. Previous studies assessing CVD risk in AATD have shown contradictory results, but most studies have been small or have included patients on augmentation therapy [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR29"">29</xref>]. The European AATD Research Collaboration international registry suggested that in untreated homozygous Z patients’ the prevalence of cardiovascular was 20.9%, which was even higher in augmented patients (38.5%) [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR19"">19</xref>]. Although the reasons are currently unknown, this could reflect differences in disease severity, progression rates or co-morbidities [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR19"">19</xref>] which were main factors in deciding on augmentation therapy. A Danish study of only 6 ZZ homozygotes and 39 MZ heterozygotes described lower blood pressure with MZ patients having a lower risk of coronary vascular disease compared to non-AATD controls [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR15"">15</xref>]. A study of 139 AATD patients found those already receiving augmentation therapy (n = 110) had a lower blood pressure and a lower prevalence of diagnosed CVD, (taking into account age, smoking, body mass index and lung function), compared to non-AATD COPD [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR29"">29</xref>]. Other studies have suggested a higher potential risk of CVD by aPWV including one of 19 AATD patients and 20 age-matched controls [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR21"">21</xref>]. Arterial stiffness was also raised in 33 patients with AATD [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR17"">17</xref>] and a study of 51 AATD patients showed evidence of large vessel degeneration [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR22"">22</xref>]. The study presented here is the largest and most comprehensive study of patients with confirmed and non-augmented AATD (PiZ and Znull). The discordance between cardiovascular risk in AATD using QRISK2® and aPWV is an important finding. In usual clinical practice, QRISK2<bold>®</bold> is frequently used for sole CVD risk assessment, but unlike in non-AATD COPD and the HC in this study, QRISK2<bold>®</bold> did not identify a significant proportion of patients with a raised aPWV in AATD (perhaps because of a lower smoking history). This suggests that traditional CVD risk factors may not account for all CVD in AATD and that QRISK2® alone may not be a sufficient screening tool to detect CVD in AATD. The discordance between cardiovascular risk in AATD as measured by aPWV (especially when adjusted for age and smoking status) and QRISK2® would support the premise that traditional risk factors may not account for, and therefore, might not identify, all CVD risk in AATD. In non-AATD COPD there is a strong relationship between QRISK2® score and aPWV, retained in multivariate analysis [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR30"">30</xref>]. This is also true for asymptomatic healthy controls, where QRISK2<bold>®</bold> scores and aPWV align [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR31"">31</xref>]. If CVD risk scores give discordant results in AATD whilst, they correlate in other diseases, it is important to understand the actual risk of CVD and the mechanism for risk including the best non-invasive tool to predict risk and the best measures to reduce this risk including augmentation therapy in studies described above. The use of QRISK2® in AATD may systematically underestimate measured CVD risk, although if aPWV is high and QRISK2® is low it raises issues about relevant preventative management. The current paper highlights the relationship between neutrophil proteinases and arterial stiffness in AATD, suggesting proteinases as a potential therapeutic target and hence augmentation as a possible strategy to reduce risk. There is a wealth of evidence supporting the role of the neutrophil in AATD, with cell numbers and their products mechanistically linked to all aspects of disease [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR27"">27</xref>]. Augmentation therapy has been the cornerstone of specific treatment of AATD for decades, with studies showing that it reduces the rate of progression of emphysema [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR4"">4</xref>]. Coronary and large arterial blood vessels contain elastin. When elastin fibres are damaged, contraction is transferred to collagen fibres, which are 100–1000 times stiffer than elastin fibres [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR32"">32</xref>]. Proteinase activity is associated with arterial stiffness measured by aPWV [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR33"">33</xref>] and there is an increasing body of evidence implicating neutrophils, and specifically proteinases in the pathogenesis of CVD (recently reviewed [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR34"">34</xref>]). If neutrophil proteinases are implicated in CVD, it is logical to assume the signal will be amplified in AATD patients who are not receiving augmentation therapy, and that the signal could be reduced in AATD patients receiving augmentation therapy This would be consistent with the current study and studies of CVD in AATD reported to date (and described above). It is possible that augmentation therapy may therefore reduce proteinase-associated CVD risk in AATD. Indeed the data presented here suggests, a study of proteinase-directed therapy to reduce CVD risk in AATD should be undertaken. The current study has strengths. It includes the highest number of unaugmented AATD patients involved in a study of CVD risk, and so represents the natural history of the disease. It includes validated tests to assess CVD risk, a validated marker of proteinase 3 activity and lung function performed by trained physiologists to international standards. All tests were performed, and samples collected on the same day. Longitudinal follow up enabled assessment of subsequent emergence of new diagnoses of CVD. Statistical adjustment was performed to minimise the confounding effects of traditional CVD risk factors, such as age and smoking history. However, the relationship between proteinase activity and aPWV was maintained in AATD patients even after this adjustment. Although adjustment of age and smoking history changed the relationship of aPWV values between groups, with aPWV becoming higher in the AATD group than non-AATD COPD patients and HC. This suggests that AATD alone accounts for the increased risk in this patient cohort. The current study has some potential weaknesses. It did not include coronary artery angiograms to diagnose CVD definitively in AATD but instead measured or calculated CVD risk. However, patients were followed up to assess the development of CVD over time. Formal longitudinal studies will be needed to determine whether the degree of neutrophil activity (which can be variable in AATD) influences the severity of CVD or the timing of its acquisition, but this type of study will always be challenging in a rare disease. The numbers of usual COPD and HC needed for the current study were based on aPWV for power calculations, and other comparisons may remain underpowered and interpretation should be considered with this in mind. Patients were recruited from secondary care clinics, research cohorts and specialist clinics, and therefore may reflect a selection bias. No adjustments were undertaken for multiple comparisons, but exact p values are provided. In conclusion, this study provides important insights into CVD risk in AATD, highlighting elevated risk measured by arterial stiffness when adjusted for age and smoking history and is not captured by QRISK2®. The study supports using physiological tests (such as aPWV) when screening for CVD risk in AATD, and not relying on traditional risk factors alone. This study suggests relationships between CVD and lung disease in AATD, with a proposed mechanism being proteinase-driven breakdown of elastin fibres in the large arteries and lungs. Studies assessing the effects of augmentation therapy or anti-proteinases on CVD in carefully matched AATD patients are now indicated, to test this hypothesis further. This observational study was approved by the Health Research Authority and National Research Ethics Committees (REC) and all research procedures took place after gaining informed written consent. Three cohorts of participants were recruited in Birmingham, UK; the AATD registry (REC:3359a), the West Midlands COPD database (REC:12/EM/0090) and a cohort without COPD or AATD (termed healthy controls (HC)) (REC:15/WM/0002). Some AATD patients were recruited from the Royal Free London NHS Foundation Trust (RFH) (REC:13/LO/1085). All participants were recruited between 2016 and 2018.

Characteristics of Patients With Alpha-1 Antitrypsin Deficiency From Rural Appalachia: A Retrospective Single-Center Study,"Alpha-1 antitrypsin (AAT) deficiency, an autosomal co-dominant inherited condition, significantly impacts lung and liver functions, with mutations in the SERPINA1 gene, notably the Z allele, playing a pivotal role in disease susceptibility. This retrospective descriptive study from a rural Eastern Kentucky pulmonary clinic aimed to characterize patients with AAT deficiency, focusing on demographic, clinical, and laboratory parameters extracted from electronic health records (EHR) of Appalachian Regional Healthcare (ARH). Among 100 patient encounters, 56 were analyzed, revealing notable sex-based differences in smoking rates and co-existing conditions, with males showing higher rates of black lung and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. In comparison, females exhibited higher rates of asthma, COVID-19, pneumothorax, and obstructive sleep apnea. The study emphasizes the importance of understanding genotype-phenotype correlations and demographic factors in assessing AAT deficiency, advocating for further research to refine management strategies and elucidate causal relationships.","Alpha-1 antitrypsin (AAT) deficiency is inherited in an autosomal co-dominant fashion, which means two different alleles are expressed, one from each parent. The most common gene involved in AAT is SERPINA1 [<xref rid=""REF1"" ref-type=""bibr"">1</xref>]. AAT is a protease inhibitor of elastase, a proteolytic enzyme. The homozygous and heterozygous genotypes involved with AAT deficiency are MS, MF, MZ, SS, SZ, ZZ, and null. The genotypes determine the risk of developing emphysema and other organ involvement. Most commonly, AAT deficiency affects the lungs, liver, and rarely the skin [<xref rid=""REF2"" ref-type=""bibr"">2</xref>]. This article was previously presented as a meeting abstract at the 2023 CHEST Annual Meeting on October 9, 2023. This retrospective descriptive study was conducted on patients with AAT deficiency. This study was approved by the Appalachian Regional Healthcare Institutional Review Board (IRB). As per IRB requirements, written consent was waived for this project, as it is a retrospective study, which includes the abstraction of data from medical records. All the patients were from a single pulmonary clinic, and the data were extracted from the electronic health records (EHR) of the Appalachian Regional Healthcare (ARH) clinic allocated in rural Eastern Kentucky. The information for all patients, including demographic data, clinical characteristics, and laboratory parameters, was extracted electronically. The study used descriptive analysis to summarize the characteristics of patients with AAT deficiency. Data for 100 patient encounters with AAT deficiency were extracted from EHR, and 44 patients were excluded due to missing variables. We conducted the preliminary analysis on the remaining 56 patient encounters. The characteristics studied were age, BMI, smoking, lung disease, pulmonary function, genotype, and alpha-1 level and were stratified by sex. Table <xref rid=""TAB1"" ref-type=""table"">1</xref> demonstrates the characteristics of patients with AAT deficiency, stratified by sex. The results reveal a higher prevalence of AAT deficiency among males under 40 years and over 70 years than females in these age groups. Additionally, individuals with a BMI above 30 and those who smoke are more likely to have AAT deficiency. Females with co-existing conditions such as asthma, COVID-19, pneumothorax, and obstructive sleep apnea exhibit a higher incidence of AAT deficiency compared to males with these conditions. Conversely, males have a higher prevalence of AAT deficiency when co-existing with conditions like black lung, coronary artery disease, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). The MS genotype is more common among males and females with AAT deficiency, followed by the MZ phenotype. Moreover, alpha-1 levels are generally higher in males, but a significant proportion of both genders with AAT deficiency exhibit normal alpha-1 levels. AAT deficiency is inherited in an autosomal co-dominant fashion, which means two different alleles are expressed, one from each parent. SERPINA1 gene located on chromosome 14 is the common gene involved in AAT deficiency. There are many variant alleles of approximately 150 associated with AAT deficiency. The normal allele is referred to as ""M."" The critical variant is the ""Z"" allele that causes AAT deficiency by homozygous substitution of glutamic acid by lysine at position 342 (Glu342Lys) [<xref rid=""REF3"" ref-type=""bibr"">3</xref>]. AAT is a protease inhibitor, denoted as ""PI"" [<xref rid=""REF4"" ref-type=""bibr"">4</xref>]. The alleles are denoted with related letters. ""PI*MM"" refers to a protease inhibitor homozygosity for the normal gene. ""PI*ZZ"" refers to a protease inhibitor homozygosity for the Z allele. ""PI SS"" refers to a protease inhibitor homozygosity for the S allele. ""PI*SZ"" refers to protease inhibitor heterozygosity for S and Z alleles. ""S"" mutation is due to the substitution of glutamic acid by valine at position 264. PI*SZ are at increased risk of lung pathology in smokers, whereas PI*SS are not at increased risk [<xref rid=""REF5"" ref-type=""bibr"">5</xref>]. Hepatocytes secrete AAT, and its action is to protect lung elasticity by inhibiting neutrophil elastase. Gain of function point mutation leads to liver disease by accumulation of misfolded AAT. The first three exons, named 1A, 1B, and 1C, are untranslated regions (UTR). The last four exons have the coding region and the terminal UTR [<xref rid=""REF6"" ref-type=""bibr"">6</xref>]. The clinical manifestations can either be limited to the lungs and liver or can be systemic and involve the skin and sometimes blood vessels. Pulmonary symptoms can range from cough to respiratory insufficiency. AAT deficiency patients, even with no to minimal smoking, will have panacinar emphysema affecting the lower lobes [<xref rid=""REF3"" ref-type=""bibr"">3</xref>], and sometimes, it can affect the upper lobes as well. Emphysema is caused by loss of function mutation, which means there is an imbalance between neutrophil elastase in the lung, which destroys elastin, and the elastase inhibitor AAT, which is synthesized in hepatocytes and protects against proteolytic degradation of elastin [<xref rid=""REF6"" ref-type=""bibr"">6</xref>]. Lung inflammation and destruction are caused by the chemotactic nature of Z antitrypsin, along with cigarette smoking. The progression of pulmonary function status is based on the frequency of COPD exacerbations. We can diagnose it with AAT level, computed tomography (CT) of the chest, pulmonary function tests (PFTs), and diffusion capacity of the lung measurement [<xref rid=""REF7"" ref-type=""bibr"">7</xref>]. COPD in AAT will be treated like standard COPD with long-acting beta-2 agonists (LABA), long-acting muscarinic antagonists (LAMA), and or inhaled corticosteroids (ICS). Combination therapy of LABA with ICS has no statistical significance on all-cause mortality in COPD patients [<xref rid=""REF8"" ref-type=""bibr"">8</xref>]. Hepatic manifestations can vary from neonatal hepatitis to hepatocellular carcinoma. The symptoms are caused by accumulating unsecreted AAT molecules due to the gain of function mutation. Diagnosis can be made by measuring the levels of aspartate aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase, bilirubin, albumin, prothrombin time, and alpha-fetoprotein, liver ultrasound, and CT scan of the liver [<xref rid=""REF9"" ref-type=""bibr"">9</xref>]. The skin manifestations are commonly seen in the PI*ZZ phenotype, and they can present with painful subcutaneous nodules known as panniculitis due to the accumulation of neutrophils causing inflammation. The other systemic manifestations include aneurysms of arteries and great blood vessels [<xref rid=""REF7"" ref-type=""bibr"">7</xref>]. Painful cutaneous panniculitis is diagnosed by histology of the biopsied specimen, which shows necrosis, acanthosis, and neutrophil accumulation. According to Lopes et al., there is no standard treatment protocol for panniculitis, but we can try steroids, colchicine, and dapsone [<xref rid=""REF10"" ref-type=""bibr"">10</xref>]. An analysis of the German registry demonstrated that female patients with GOLD I-IV showed significantly lower numbers of pack-years and BMI. Further, this study revealed a significant delay in diagnosis for female patients [<xref rid=""REF11"" ref-type=""bibr"">11</xref>]. Another study by Xue et al. demonstrated high levels of correlation between obesity and AAT levels [<xref rid=""REF12"" ref-type=""bibr"">12</xref>]. Another observational study of the international registry demonstrated COPD in 57.2% and bronchiectasis in 22% of patients [<xref rid=""REF13"" ref-type=""bibr"">13</xref>]. Limitations This study has several limitations. Recall bias and database documentation errors are derived from the intrinsic study design. Along with these limitations, we could not complete a multivariate analysis because of the small sample size due to several missing variables. Racial characterizations for patients were not captured in the datasets for the study. Thus, racial disparities related to the AAT could not be measured. Dates were based on the dates of office appointments to the ARH system, not the date of symptom onset or diagnosis. Our team could also not assess the differences in severity or stage of comorbid conditions because only the International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision (ICD-10) master codes were utilized. Future studies comparing the clinical impacts of specific variants in rural Appalachian and urban or suburban communities should be assessed to unveil potential health disparities between the communities. Further, retrospective or prospective studies examining the effects of different therapeutic modalities, such as intravenous augmentation therapies, in this particularly comorbid patient population may provide interesting insight. This descriptive study elucidates the demographic and clinical characteristics of patients with AAT deficiency. Elderly and high BMI individuals are more commonly affected. Among the 100 patient encounters, notable sex-based differences in smoking rates and co-existing conditions were observed, with males showing higher rates of black lung and COPD, while females exhibited higher rates of asthma, COVID-19, pneumothorax, and obstructive sleep apnea. The predominant genotype distribution comprised MS and MZ types, with males demonstrating higher alpha-1 levels than females. However, causative analyses were limited by sample size constraints. These findings underscore the imperative for further research endeavors aimed at refining management strategies and elucidating causal relationships, thereby enhancing the understanding and management of AAT deficiency.",N/A,18 3 2024
Characteristics associated with SF-36 in alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency-associated COPD: a cross-sectional analysis,,"Individuals with alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency (AATD) are genetically predisposed to premature loss of lung function and development of emphysema, particularly if they smoke tobacco or are exposed to environmental toxins [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR1"">1</xref>, <xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR2"">2</xref>]. Those with severely deficient AATD genotypes, including ZZ, ZNull, NullNull, and SZ, often carry a higher risk of lung disease progression [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR3"">3</xref>]. Unfortunately, AATD-associated lung disease is often underdiagnosed [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR2"">2</xref>, <xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR4"">4</xref>], impacting day-to-day activities as symptoms of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), such as shortness of breath and cough develop, leading to worsened quality of life [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR5"">5</xref>]. Health-related quality of life (HRQoL) is a broad measure of self-perceived disease burden in people with lung disease. Research indicates that those with AATD-associated COPD experience increased dyspnea at a younger age compared to non-AATD COPD [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR6"">6</xref>], resulting in earlier and more significant impairment in health status. AATD-associated COPD is treated with symptom management and weekly intravenous augmentation therapy of purified plasma-derived alpha-1 antitrypsin; however, these therapies do not cure the disease. Thus, improving HRQoL in this population is highly important. Various instruments, both disease-specific (e.g., the Saint George’s Respiratory Questionnaire [SGRQ]) and generic (e.g., the 36-item Short-Form Health Survey [SF-36]), have been developed and validated to assess the quality of life impairment in people with lung disease [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR7"">7</xref>, <xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR8"">8</xref>]. Research indicates that the COPD-specific SGRQ is highly correlated with clinical measures and pulmonary symptoms distinguishing between levels of COPD severity [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR8"">8</xref>]. On the other hand, generic HRQoL instruments, like SF-36, offer a more comprehensive assessment of health, evaluating the general impact of the disease on various aspects of well-being, including mental health and physical functioning [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR9"">9</xref>]. Moreover, generic HRQoL assessment tools allow comparisons across different health conditions and with the general population [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR10"">10</xref>]. Studies show that SF-36 is a valid instrument for measuring HRQoL in people with COPD [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR11"">11</xref>]. Although HRQoL is not commonly used as a primary outcome measure in COPD clinical trials, many therapeutic interventions in COPD are designed to improve individuals’ quality of life [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR12"">12</xref>]. Research on HRQoL in populations with AATD-associated COPD remains limited, with findings often variable and inconsistent regarding the burden of disease [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR13"">13</xref>]. Assessing factors influencing the deterioration of HRQoL in people living with AATD will improve our understanding of the natural history and progression of the disease and aid in the development of interventions to stabilize and improve HRQoL in this population. Therefore, the present study aims to evaluate the association between HRQoL and patient- and disease-specific characteristics within a large cohort of individuals with AATD-associated lung disease.  Overall, 4398 AlphaNet participants were included in this study (Fig. <xref rid=""Fig1"" ref-type=""fig"">1</xref>). The average age of the participants was 57.6 (SD=10.6) years; 45.4% were women, and 96.1% were non-Hispanic White. Severe AATD genotypes (ZZ, ZNull, or NullNull) were prevalent in this cohort (Table <xref rid=""Tab1"" ref-type=""table"">1</xref>). Most participants (56.4%) experienced two or more exacerbations in the past year, and 44.0% had daily productive cough for at least 3 months each year over the past 2 years (Table <xref rid=""Tab1"" ref-type=""table"">1</xref>). The mean mMRC score was 2.4 (SD=1.3), and 49.6% of all participants had mMRC scores of 3 or 4.<table-wrap id=""Tab1""><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Demographic and clinical characteristics of the study population and SF-36 summary scores, <italic toggle=""yes"">n</italic>=4398</p></caption><table frame=""hsides"" rules=""groups""><thead><tr><th align=""left"" rowspan=""2""></th><th align=""left"" rowspan=""2"">n (%)</th><th align=""left"">Mental Component Summary (MCS) score<sup>a</sup></th><th align=""left"">Physical Component Summary (PCS) score<sup>a</sup></th></tr><tr><th align=""left"">mean (SD)</th><th align=""left"">mean (SD)</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align=""left"" colspan=""4"">Age, years</td></tr><tr><td align=""left""> <50</td><td align=""left"">1010 (22.96)</td><td align=""left"">48.15 (11.57)</td><td align=""left"">35.65 (10.05)</td></tr><tr><td align=""left""> 50-65</td><td align=""left"">2355 (53.55)</td><td align=""left"">51.27 (10.64)</td><td align=""left"">36.30 (9.83)</td></tr><tr><td align=""left""> >65</td><td align=""left"">1033 (23.49)</td><td align=""left"">53.97 (9.37)</td><td align=""left"">37.10 (9.29)</td></tr><tr><td align=""left"" colspan=""4"">Sex</td></tr><tr><td align=""left""> Female</td><td align=""left"">1996 (45.38)</td><td align=""left"">51.58 (10.52)</td><td align=""left"">36.38 (9.91)</td></tr><tr><td align=""left""> Male</td><td align=""left"">2402 (54.62)</td><td align=""left"">50.87 (10.95)</td><td align=""left"">36.31 (9.64)</td></tr><tr><td align=""left"" colspan=""4"">mMRC<sup>b</sup></td></tr><tr><td align=""left""> 0</td><td align=""left"">404 (9.19)</td><td align=""left"">54.25 (8.36)</td><td align=""left"">45.48 (9.27)</td></tr><tr><td align=""left""> 1</td><td align=""left"">986 (22.42)</td><td align=""left"">53.63 (8.96)</td><td align=""left"">41.87 (8.75)</td></tr><tr><td align=""left""> 2</td><td align=""left"">826 (18.78)</td><td align=""left"">51.92 (10.42)</td><td align=""left"">36.78 (8.29)</td></tr><tr><td align=""left""> 3</td><td align=""left"">950 (21.60)</td><td align=""left"">50.94 (10.89)</td><td align=""left"">33.64 (8.06)</td></tr><tr><td align=""left""> 4</td><td align=""left"">1232 (28.01)</td><td align=""left"">47.90 (11.99)</td><td align=""left"">30.63 (8.05)</td></tr><tr><td align=""left"" colspan=""4"">Frequency of exacerbations in the past year</td></tr><tr><td align=""left""> 0</td><td align=""left"">1001 (22.76)</td><td align=""left"">53.99 (9.07)</td><td align=""left"">40.32 (9.56)</td></tr><tr><td align=""left""> 1</td><td align=""left"">915 (20.80)</td><td align=""left"">52.89 (9.89)</td><td align=""left"">38.39 (9.48)</td></tr><tr><td align=""left""> 2 or more</td><td align=""left"">2482 (56.43)</td><td align=""left"">49.43 (11.35)</td><td align=""left"">33.97 (9.25)</td></tr><tr><td align=""left"" colspan=""4"">Regular use of oxygen in the past year</td></tr><tr><td align=""left""> No</td><td align=""left"">2193 (49.86)</td><td align=""left"">51.67 (10.46)</td><td align=""left"">39.33 (9.77)</td></tr><tr><td align=""left""> Yes</td><td align=""left"">2205 (50.14)</td><td align=""left"">50.71 (11.04)</td><td align=""left"">33.36 (8.80)</td></tr><tr><td align=""left"" colspan=""4"">Daily productive cough for at least 3 months each year over the past 2 years</td></tr><tr><td align=""left""> No</td><td align=""left"">2462 (55.98)</td><td align=""left"">52.35 (10.20)</td><td align=""left"">37.96 (9.76)</td></tr><tr><td align=""left""> Yes</td><td align=""left"">1936 (44.02)</td><td align=""left"">49.72 (11.27)</td><td align=""left"">34.27 (9.38)</td></tr><tr><td align=""left"" colspan=""4"">Alpha1 variant</td></tr><tr><td align=""left""> ZZ</td><td align=""left"">2305 (62.16)</td><td align=""left"">51.89 (10.29)</td><td align=""left"">37.23 (9.96)</td></tr><tr><td align=""left""> ZNull</td><td align=""left"">31 (0.84)</td><td align=""left"">52.11 (11.31)</td><td align=""left"">36.91 (9.64)</td></tr><tr><td align=""left""> NullNull</td><td align=""left"">12 (0.32)</td><td align=""left"">53.17 (10.10)</td><td align=""left"">34.54 (9.99)</td></tr><tr><td align=""left""> FF & FZ</td><td align=""left"">31 (0.84)</td><td align=""left"">50.80 (9.59)</td><td align=""left"">35.38 (9.88)</td></tr><tr><td align=""left""> SZ</td><td align=""left"">382 (10.30)</td><td align=""left"">51.24 (10.53)</td><td align=""left"">36.50 (9.73)</td></tr><tr><td align=""left""> MZ</td><td align=""left"">733 (19.77)</td><td align=""left"">50.43 (11.44)</td><td align=""left"">35.05 (9.42)</td></tr><tr><td align=""left""> Other<sup>c</sup></td><td align=""left"">214 (5.77)</td><td align=""left"">50.19 (11.26)</td><td align=""left"">34.62 (9.80)</td></tr><tr><td align=""left"">Data available <italic toggle=""yes"">n</italic>=3708</td><td align=""left""></td><td align=""left""></td><td align=""left""></td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><p><sup>a</sup>MCS and PCS have a mean of 50 (±10) in the general US population.

In the 1033 individuals who completed SF-36 more than one year after baseline (23.5% of the sample), the average time between the baseline and SF-36 was 829.1 (SD=471.2) days. Participants in the two groups did not differ by age, mMRC, or presence of productive cough and had similar PCS scores. The group with more than a year between the two assessment dates had a greater proportion of males, lower use of oxygen, higher number of exacerbations, and better MCS scores. (Supplemental Table <xref rid=""MOESM1"" ref-type=""media"">1</xref>). As demonstrated in Fig. <xref rid=""Fig2"" ref-type=""fig"">2</xref>, physical health in this cohort was markedly lower than in the general US population, with the mean PCS score of 36.3 (SD=9.8). In contrast, mental health was comparable with the general US population, with the mean MCS score of 51.2 (SD= 10.8). SF-36 subscale scores for physical functioning, role physical, and general health and vitality were the most impacted domains, with mean scores in the lower half of the scale range (Fig. <xref rid=""Fig3"" ref-type=""fig"">3</xref>).<fig id=""Fig2""><label>Fig. 2</label><caption><p>Baseline SF-36 summary component score means in the overall cohort, <italic toggle=""yes"">n</italic>=4398.

We identified several disease aspects of COPD as determinants of lower self-perceived quality of life, including dyspnea and frequent exacerbations, as well as markers of disease severity, including regular use of oxygen and chronic productive cough. Living with COPD impacts an individual’s physical and social daily activities and well-being. With disease progression, dyspnea is often the primary symptom leading to the reduction in regular physical activities and social interactions and hence impacts the quality of one’s life. Literature suggests that dyspnea scores tend to be closely correlated with general health status in COPD [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR17"">17</xref>, <xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR18"">18</xref>]. Dyspnea is one of the main foci of the disease-specific HRQoL instruments, such as SGRQ, and has been shown to correlate with worse health status in people with COPD [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR19"">19</xref>, <xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR20"">20</xref>]. In our study, we used a disease-agnostic, generic instrument and demonstrated similar associations of worse HRQoL in those with greater levels of dyspnea. Our findings are consistent with a study that found a strong association between dyspnea and the physical health component of SF-36 and a moderate association with its mental health component [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR21"">21</xref>]. Research shows that frequent acute exacerbations are associated with long-term impact on HRQoL in patients with COPD and AATD-associated lung disease [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR22"">22</xref>, <xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR23"">23</xref>]. Consistent with other studies, our analyses showed consistently worse mental and physical health in people experiencing exacerbations, predominantly impacting physical health domains. Moreover, the strongest association with low HRQoL was observed in frequent exacerbators reporting 2 or more exacerbations per year. Cough with sputum production is often the primary reason for seeking medical care in people with COPD [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR24"">24</xref>]. In our study, individuals reporting having daily productive cough for at least 3 months each year over the past 2 years had significantly worse physical and mental HRQoL compared to those not experiencing this symptom. SF-36 subscale scores were consistently lower in those with productive cough across all domains. Several studies support our findings of association between productive cough and HRQoL [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR25"">25</xref>–<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR27"">27</xref>]. Regular use of oxygen in our study was considered a proxy measure of disease severity and was prevalent in over a half of the participants. Our findings demonstrated significant impairment in physical functioning and general health in those on regular oxygen. Previous research showing worse physical functioning-related HRQoL in people with COPD on long-term oxygen treatment support our results [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR28"">28</xref>]. In this study, younger participants reported less favorable HRQoL, particularly limitations due to physical problems, general health, and vitality. This paradoxical finding may be associated with higher life expectations in younger adults and the impact of AATD-associated COPD on these expectations of health and vitality [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR29"">29</xref>]. Other studies support our findings and report an inverse association between age and HRQoL in people with COPD [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR30"">30</xref>] and AATD-associated lung disease [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR31"">31</xref>]. We found similar associations in our earlier work examining HRQoL in people with AATD using a disease-specific instrument, SGRQ [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR29"">29</xref>]. Our analyses demonstrated that in this cohort of people with AATD-associated lung disease, males and females had comparable experiences with their physical quality of life as well as specific domains of mental health. The overall summary component of mental health showed a moderately better perception in women. These findings are supported by previous research showing no difference in HRQoL between sexes [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR32"">32</xref>] or greater decline in HRQoL in men with COPD [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR33"">33</xref>]. In contrast, other studies report greater impairment of HRQoL in women using SGRQ [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR34"">34</xref>] and SF-36 instruments [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR25"">25</xref>]. Our results indicate that the multivariable model fit for PCS that included age, mMRC, frequency of exacerbation, use of oxygen, and productive cough explained a moderate 30% of the variability in the score mean. However, the multivariable model fit for MCS that included the above-mentioned variables as well as sex was able to explain only 9% of the MCS score variability. The remaining variance may be associated with other predictors of mental health not included in the present analyses. The results from an earlier study show that in people with COPD, MCS score was associated with dyspnea, depression, use of antidepressants, education, and daytime sleepiness [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR35"">35</xref>]. These variables explained 35% of the MCS variability in that study. Depression and anxiety were identified as important predictors of low self-perceived quality of life in several other COPD studies [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR25"">25</xref>]. Interestingly, research indicates that people with AATD-associated COPD do not report higher anxiety and depression symptoms compared to those with non-AATD COPD [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR6"">6</xref>]. Other authors indicate that anxiety and depression are common in the AATD population and may contribute to worsened health status [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR36"">36</xref>]. Since our study findings demonstrate that only a very small part of mental health is determined by lung disease-specific factors, there is an unmet need for psychological, behavioral, and cognitive assessment in this population of people with AATD-associated lung disease. Patient-perceived physical health is significantly impaired in this cohort with AATD-associated lung disease, whereas mental health status is comparable to the general US population. Several disease-specific factors are associated with worse HRQoL and need to be taken into consideration to optimize the quality of life of people living with AATD. Further longitudinal studies are needed to examine the changes in SF-36 physical and mental health scores over time and the factors associated with these changes. ",N/A,18 3 2024
The impact of alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency alleles on lung cancer survival,"Different studies have shown that carrying an alpha-1 antitrypsin (AAT) deficiency allele is an independent risk factor for developing lung cancer (LC). However, to date, little is known regarding whether carrying a deficiency allele may be a prognostic factor in the evolution of LC. A prospective observational study was carried out which consecutively included patients diagnosed with LC in University Hospital “Nuestra Señora de Candelaria” between December 2017 and August 2020. A blood sample was taken from each of the patients in order to determine both AAT serum concentration and genotype. Based on AAT genotype, patients were divided into the deficiency (<italic toggle=""yes"">Pi*</italic>≠<italic toggle=""yes"">MM</italic>) or non-deficiency (<italic toggle=""yes"">Pi*=MM</italic>) group. One hundred and sixty-four patients were included. The average length of follow-up was 13±10 months. Patients were classified as stage I (4.2%), stage II (8.3%), stage III (31.2%) and stage IV (56.3%), according to tumour, node and metastasis (TNM) staging. Twenty-eight patients (17%) were carriers of a deficiency allele (6 <italic toggle=""yes"">Pi*MS</italic>, 1 <italic toggle=""yes"">Pi*MZ</italic>, 1 <italic toggle=""yes"">Pi*MM<sub>heerlen</sub></italic>).

The presence of an AAT deficiency genotype could be a potential prognostic marker in LC. However, larger studies that justify these findings are needed.","Lung cancer (LC) is considered to be one of the leading causes of cancer-related mortality in many regions around the world (<xref rid=""r1"" ref-type=""bibr"">1</xref>). Beyond the tumour, node and metastasis (TNM) staging system (<xref rid=""r2"" ref-type=""bibr"">2</xref>), few prognostic factors have been identified to allow us to predict patients’ future evolution in our routine clinical practice. Alpha-1 antitrypsin (AAT) is a water-soluble glycoprotein primarily synthesized in the hepatocytes (80%) (<xref rid=""r3"" ref-type=""bibr"">3</xref>). <italic toggle=""yes"">Pi*M</italic> (Pi: protease inhibitor) is the most common allele and is present in over 90% of normal subjects, with the most common deficiency alleles being <italic toggle=""yes"">Pi*S </italic>and<italic toggle=""yes""> Pi*Z </italic>(<xref rid=""r4"" ref-type=""bibr"">4</xref>). Different studies have shown that carrying an AAT deficiency allele is an independent risk factor for developing LC (<xref rid=""r5"" ref-type=""bibr"">5</xref>-<xref rid=""r9"" ref-type=""bibr"">9</xref>). However, to date, little is known regarding whether carrying a deficiency allele may be a prognostic factor in the evolution of LC. We present this article in accordance with the REMARK reporting checklist (available at <ext-link http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink href=""https://tcr.amegroups.com/article/view/10.21037/tcr-23-743/rc"" ext-link-type=""uri"">https://tcr.amegroups.com/article/view/10.21037/tcr-23-743/rc</ext-link>). A prospective observational study was carried out which consecutively included patients diagnosed with LC in University Hospital “Nuestra Señora de Candelaria” between December 2017 and August 2020. The study was conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki (as revised in 2013). The study was approved by the Ethics Committee of the University Hospital “Nuestra Señora de Candelaria” (Code PI 75-17), and informed consent was taken from all the patients. The inclusion criteria were: >18 years old with an LC diagnosis confirmed with histological study. The existence of a concomitant infection at the time of diagnosis, starting active oncological treatment before the blood extraction (determining AAT protein serum levels/AAT genotype) and/or the patient declining to participate in the study were reasons for exclusion. Patients’ age, tobacco history, body mass index, AAT serum levels at the time of diagnosis, AAT genotype, histological LC type and comorbidities (arterial hypertension, dyslipidemia, diabetes mellitus, heart failure, atrial fibrillation, ischemic heart disease, stroke and chronic kidney disease) were recorded. LC extension was determined using the 8th edition TNM staging system (<xref rid=""r2"" ref-type=""bibr"">2</xref>), and the age adjusted Charlson comorbidity index (CCI) was calculated. A blood sample was taken from each of the patients in order to determine both AAT serum concentration and genotype. AAT serum values were determined using nephelometry (BN ProSpec System, Siemens, Berlin, Germany). Genomic DNA was purified from EDTA whole blood (MagCore<sup>®</sup> Genomic DNA Whole Blood Kit, RBC Bioscience, Buenos Aires, Argentina). The two most common deficiency alleles (<italic toggle=""yes"">PI*S</italic> and <italic toggle=""yes"">PI*Z</italic>) were genotyped using real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) with TaqMan probes (Applied Biosystems 7500, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, USA). The genotypes obtained were correlated with the reference AAT plasma values at University Hospital “Nuestra Señora de Candelaria”. Patients with AAT serum levels that did not match those expected for the S/Z genotypes obtained underwent complete sequencing of the coding exons and flanking intronic regions of the SERPINA1 gene using an AB3500 capillary sequencing instrument (Applied Biosystems), comparing the results obtained with the reference sequence NM_001127701.1 (SeqScape 3.0, Thermo Fisher Scientific). Based on AAT genotype, patients were divided into the deficiency (<italic toggle=""yes"">Pi*</italic>≠<italic toggle=""yes"">MM</italic>) or non-deficiency (<italic toggle=""yes"">Pi*=MM</italic>) group. Student’s<italic toggle=""yes""> t</italic>-test was used for continuous variables and the Chi-square test and Fisher’s exact test were used for categorical variables. The survival curves were generated using the Kaplan-Meier method and compared using the log-rank test. Univariate and multivariate survival analyses were carried out using the Cox proportional hazards regression model and confidence intervals of 95% were estimated for the hazard ratio (HR). The assumed constant HR was verified (χ<sup>2</sup>=0.43; P=0.511). This statistical analysis used IBM SPSS (Statistical Package for the Social Sciences) version 22.0 (IBM Corp., Armonk, NY, USA). P values ≤0.05 (bilateral) were considered significant. Of the 167 patients initially included, the analysis was carried out in 164 (3 patients were lost to follow-up). They were primarily male (63.4%), with an average age of 64.5±9.1 years and 52.4% were current smokers; the average CCI score was 8±2. The average length of follow-up was 13±10 months. Ninety-two patients (56.1%) passed away, with an average follow-up of 9±7 months. The most frequent histological type of LC was adenocarcinoma (40.9%). Patients were classified as stage I (4.2%), stage II (8.3%), stage III (31.2%) and stage IV (56.3%), according to TNM staging. Twenty-eight patients (17%) were carriers of a deficiency allele (26 <italic toggle=""yes"">Pi*MS</italic>, 1 <italic toggle=""yes"">Pi*MZ</italic>, 1 <italic toggle=""yes"">Pi*MM<sub>heerlen</sub></italic>). No significant differences were found with respect to baseline characteristics between <italic toggle=""yes"">Pi*</italic>≠<italic toggle=""yes"">MM</italic> and <italic toggle=""yes"">Pi*=MM</italic>, including AAT serum levels (<xref rid=""t1"" ref-type=""table""><italic toggle=""yes"">Tables 1,2</italic></xref><xref rid=""t2"" ref-type=""table""></xref>). Patients in the <italic toggle=""yes"">Pi*</italic>≠<italic toggle=""yes"">MM</italic> group had a higher risk of death in the first 6 months after the LC diagnosis compared to <italic toggle=""yes"">Pi*=MM</italic> subjects (HR =2.04; 95% CI: 1.04–4.0; P=0.038) (<xref rid=""f1"" ref-type=""fig""><italic toggle=""yes"">Figure 1A</italic></xref>). A second analysis was performed excluding small cell LC, maintaining an increase in mortality in the first 6 months in those subjects carrying deficient alleles (HR =2.24; 95% CI: 1.11–4.55; P=0.025) (<xref rid=""f1"" ref-type=""fig""><italic toggle=""yes"">Figure 1B</italic></xref>). This difference is diluted if we consider the entire follow-up of the patients (HR =1.44; 95% CI 0.87–2.40; P=0.156 and HR =1.48; 95% CI: 0.88–2.51; P=0.142, respectively), this may be motivated because the group of patients with a genotype from 6 months of follow-up is small in size sample (<xref rid=""f1"" ref-type=""fig""><italic toggle=""yes"">Figure 1</italic></xref>). The treatments (surgical or pharmacological) used in both groups according to staging were evaluated, however, no differences were observed in terms of treatment. Different studies have shown that those subjects who are carriers of deficiency alleles, regardless of their degree of tobacco consumption, have a greater risk of developing LC (<xref rid=""r9"" ref-type=""bibr"">9</xref>,<xref rid=""r10"" ref-type=""bibr"">10</xref>). With a described prevalence of around 13% (<xref rid=""r8"" ref-type=""bibr"">8</xref>,<xref rid=""r9"" ref-type=""bibr"">9</xref>), these figures are slightly lower than those detected in our study, which could be justified by the high prevalence of deficiency alleles in our setting (<xref rid=""r11"" ref-type=""bibr"">11</xref>). In light of these findings, some authors postulate the theory that in subjects with deficiency alleles, there is a clear protease-antiprotease imbalance originating from low AAT concentrations in the blood and tissues, which would predispose them to a tissue environment that favors carcinogenic action and consequently the development of LC. Other hypotheses postulate that the presence of low AAT levels can promote neoplasm progression by inhibiting the apoptotic capacity of tumor cells that, along with neutrophil elastase, can activate matrix metalloproteinases, a group of enzymes that play a fundamental role in tumor invasion and the origin of metastases (<xref rid=""r12"" ref-type=""bibr"">12</xref>,<xref rid=""r13"" ref-type=""bibr"">13</xref>). Studies analyzing whether the presence of a deficiency genotype can have any sort of impact on LC prognosis are scarce. Li <italic toggle=""yes"">et al. </italic>(<xref rid=""r14"" ref-type=""bibr"">14</xref>) did not find any difference in survival according to carrier status in patients diagnosed with non-small cell LC. However, in our study, those patients with LC (small cell and non-small cell LC) who carried a deficiency allele did show worse survival at 6 months after diagnosis, results that is maintained even after excluding those patients with small cell LC. Compared to the patients included in the study by Li <italic toggle=""yes"">et al.</italic>, the majority of the subjects in our sample are in advanced stages of the disease and are not suitable for curative surgery, which will influence their prognosis. Given the fact that our sample primarily focuses on stages III and IV, our results provide clinical value in these patients for whom there is not a curative option. It is important to note that in our sample, there were no significant differences between AAT serum levels in patients carrying a deficiency allele compared to non-deficiency patients. This leads us to believe that the problem may stem from AAT activity. Its dysfunction would cause an imbalance between protease-antiprotease, not in quantity but rather functionality, where despite normal or even elevated AAT levels, said protein has little or no anti-elastase activity (<xref rid=""r4"" ref-type=""bibr"">4</xref>,<xref rid=""r15"" ref-type=""bibr"">15</xref>,<xref rid=""r16"" ref-type=""bibr"">16</xref>). The main limitations of this study are its small sample size, the limited number of patients in early stages of the disease and the absence of subjects with the severe deficiency genotype, but the results provide a starting point for future lines of research. Based on all of this, the presence of an AAT deficiency genotype could be a potential prognostic marker in advanced LC. However, larger studies that justify these findings are needed. ",N/A,22 2 2024
Rare variants in alpha 1 antitrypsin deficiency: a systematic literature review,,"Alpha 1 Antitrypsin Deficiency (AATD) is a rare autosomal inherited disorder associated with the development of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) in adults, and liver disease in both adults and children [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR1"">1</xref>–<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR3"">3</xref>]. The condition is characterized by low Alpha 1 Antitrypsin (AAT) serum levels, resulting from mutations in the <italic toggle=""yes"">SERPINA1</italic> gene, which encodes the AAT protein [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR4"">4</xref>, <xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR5"">5</xref>]. AAT is a potent serine protease inhibitor (PI) and an acute-phase reactant that protects the lungs from the action of serine proteases, particularly neutrophil elastase [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR6"">6</xref>, <xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR7"">7</xref>]. Primarily produced by the liver and secreted by hepatocytes into the circulation, AAT is also produced by alveolar monocytes and macrophages [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR8"">8</xref>–<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR10"">10</xref>]. <italic toggle=""yes"">SERPINA1</italic> mutations can affect AAT serum levels and/or function, with some producing conformational changes that result in AAT polymerization and intracellular retention, disrupting the protease/antiprotease imbalance in the lungs, with damaging effects on lung parenchyma that can lead to emphysema development [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR2"">2</xref>, <xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR3"">3</xref>, <xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR11"">11</xref>]. <italic toggle=""yes"">SERPINA1</italic> shows high variability, with > 200 variants described in the ClinVar NCBI database to-date [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR12"">12</xref>, <xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR13"">13</xref>]. Due to codominance of <italic toggle=""yes"">SERPINA1</italic> alleles, phenotypes of both alleles are expressed and, therefore, up to two AAT protein variants can be present in any one individual. The M variant is the most common and results in normal AAT function and serum levels. Individuals homozygous for the M variant, referred to as PI*MM individuals, have serum AAT levels of approximately 105–164 mg/dL [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR14"">14</xref>]. Worldwide, the most common pathogenic AATD variants are the S (c.863A > T; p.Glu288Val) and Z (c.1096G > T; p.Glu366Lys) variants, which express approximately 50–60% and 10–20% of normal AAT levels, respectively [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR15"">15</xref>]. In the United States (US), the most common pathogenic AATD variants in order of prevalence are the S, Z, F (c.739C > T; p.Arg247Cys), and I (c.187C > T; p.Arg63Cys) variants, all of which result in reduced levels/functionality of AAT [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR16"">16</xref>, <xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR17"">17</xref>]. Despite being the second most common pathogenic variant worldwide, the Z variant is associated with the highest risk of lung and liver disease in AATD. The Z variant mutation leads to polymerization and intracellular retention of AAT in hepatocytes and other AAT-producing cells [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR18"">18</xref>], and as a result, PI*ZZ individuals can have serum AAT levels ~ 32 mg/dL [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR14"">14</xref>]. Rare Null variants (designated Q0) result in premature truncation of the AAT protein and are associated with a high risk of lung disease. Due to codominance of <italic toggle=""yes"">SERPINA1</italic> alleles, individuals homozygous for Null mutations have a complete absence of serum AAT [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR17"">17</xref>, <xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR19"">19</xref>], with serum levels of individuals heterozygous for Null mutations dependent upon the second type of AAT variant expressed. In the US, it is estimated that ~ 20.5 million individuals have one of the five common AATD genotypes (PI*MS, PI*MZ, PI*SS, PI*SZ, PI*ZZ); in Central and Western Europe, this figure is estimated to be ~ 44 million [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR15"">15</xref>]. It is also estimated that AATD remains largely under-recognized [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR20"">20</xref>], with ~ 90% of individuals affected by AATD in the US and Europe thought to be undiagnosed [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR21"">21</xref>, <xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR22"">22</xref>]. Failure to accurately diagnose patients can lead to poor patient outcomes due to the lack of implementation of preventative measures and appropriate treatment [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR23"">23</xref>]. New AATD variants also continue to be discovered, making AATD diagnosis challenging. As such, both quantitative and qualitative approaches should be used to aid diagnosis, such as measuring serum AAT levels, phenotyping for abnormal AAT proteins (by isoelectric focusing [IEF]), targeted genotyping for specific variants, and genetic sequencing. Variant-specific polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests can now test for several common pathogenic variants simultaneously [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR24"">24</xref>]. However, this diagnostic method will only capture the variants being screened for and will not identify rare or novel variants [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR25"">25</xref>]. Genetic sequencing of <italic toggle=""yes"">SERPINA1</italic> can identify any currently known or novel variant, but is an expensive technology often used only in certain situations [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR13"">13</xref>], such as where there are low AAT serum levels with normal genotyping results, or discrepancies between serum levels, IEF, and PCR tests. PCR testing is often limited to the more common Z and S variants, but this should be expanded to include low-frequency variants, as well as rare and country-specific mutations [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR26"">26</xref>]. A better understanding of AAT variants could help raise awareness among clinicians about the possibility of rare variants contributing to disease risk. To determine which are the most commonly reported rare AATD variants in different geographical regions, we conducted a systematic literature review. Specifically, we aimed to identify the most frequently occurring rare pathogenic variants in AATD, assess their variation by geographical area, and evaluate the utility of expanded variant testing.   This systematic review of the literature has identified numerous reports of rare AATD variants across the world. We identified 216 different types of rare AATD variant reported in the literature, 13 of which were frequently reported (> 100 times each) and 75 of which were novel. Aside from the variants that were unidentified Null/rare at the time of source article publication, the rare variant most reported worldwide was the F variant, followed by the I, E, and C variants. The F variant was also the most commonly reported known rare variant across Europe, North America, and Oceania. Together, the data highlights that AATD goes far beyond the most commonly reported Z and S variants, suggesting that there may be widespread underdiagnosis for AATD in patients with COPD. In patients with AATD, the Z and S variants are highly prevalent, with the Z variant being present in 98% of individuals exhibiting diseases related to AATD [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR29"">29</xref>]. Worldwide, there is estimated to be approximately 190 million individuals with the Z and/or S variants (either in a homozygous or heterozygous state) [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR15"">15</xref>], and yet AATD remains underrecognized [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR20"">20</xref>, <xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR30"">30</xref>]. The true number, prevalence, and types of rare AATD variants are currently unknown, which likely contributes to AATD’s under recognition. Presently, most of the evidence pertaining to the management of AATD is based on subjects who are homozygous for the Z variant or heterozygous for the Z variant and a Null variant, as these individuals are most likely to be identified as having AATD-related symptoms. Results of this study, therefore, suggests that there are many individuals who are left untreated that may otherwise benefit from treatment; these individuals may also benefit from preventative measures, such as smoking cessation, reducing exposure to environmental and occupational pollution, and early exacerbation treatment [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR1"">1</xref>, <xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR31"">31</xref>]. Individuals heterozygous for the Z variant (MZ) also have evidence of accelerated lung function decline and there are suggestions that these individuals may benefit from early diagnosis and potentially from AAT therapy [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR32"">32</xref>, <xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR33"">33</xref>]. Given the prevalence of rare variants, and the wide range of AAT serum concentrations observed in MZ individuals, there is a possibility that some individuals identified as MZ, may in fact carry an unidentified rare variant as well as the Z variant, increasing their risk of disease. However, in many cases, the clinical significance of these rare/novel variants is uncertain. The clinical significance of Null variants and the benefit of AAT therapy for individuals with these high-risk variants is less uncertain as there is some evidence that AAT therapy may be beneficial for individuals with Z/Null and Null/Null genotypes [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR34"">34</xref>–<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR36"">36</xref>]. Once there is more substantial clinical evidence for the benefit of AAT therapy in individuals with genotypes other than ZZ, clinical guidelines should be reconsidered. However, given the extreme diversity of AATD variants and the unlikelihood that clinical evidence for the efficacy of AAT therapy will be available for each variant, a pragmatic approach is perhaps needed. AAT functionality assays are not widely available at present; therefore, currently, the decision to treat patients with AAT therapy should be based upon AAT genotype and the patient’s clinical characteristics. While the F variant is not reported as frequently as the Z and S variants, the present review shows that the F variant has been observed worldwide and at high rates. The F variant was first discovered in 1965 [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR37"">37</xref>], and is associated with quantitatively normal AAT levels, but reduced AAT function and, therefore, carriers are associated with increased susceptibility to elastase-mediated lung tissue damage [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR4"">4</xref>, <xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR27"">27</xref>, <xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR38"">38</xref>]. The F and I variants can be easily detected by IEF, but as AAT serum levels expressed by the F variant are quantitatively normal, AAT serum testing alone will not identify individuals carrying this variant. Often, variant-specific PCR testing is not performed to test for the F variant, but this should be considered due to its high prevalence as well as its reduced function in preventing elastase-mediated lung tissue destruction and the ability of AAT therapy to slow the progression of lung tissue density loss [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR39"">39</xref>, <xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR40"">40</xref>]. Another variant that should be considered for routine testing is the I variant, which was the second most frequently reported known rare variant in the current study. The I variant confers a high risk of lung and liver disease, as with the Z variant, and was first characterized in 1989 [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR41"">41</xref>]. In line with the present review, there is evidence that the I variant is relatively common among patients with AATD. In a Spanish study of 3,511 AATD blood samples referred for AATD testing between 1998 and 2010 with serum AAT levels < 120 mg/dL, 34% of cases were attributed to the I variant, highlighting the variant’s potential clinical significance [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR42"">42</xref>]. The prevalence of the I variant has also been reported to vary among low frequency variants from country to country; the number of cases attributed to the I variant have been reported as 28% in Switzerland [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR43"">43</xref>], 5% in Italy [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR44"">44</xref>], and 90% in Ireland [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR45"">45</xref>]. It should be noted, however, that the IEF banding pattern for the I variant can be confused with the IEF pattern of the F variant, as both the F and I variants share the same amino acid substitution but at different positions in the protein (Arg to Cys; p.Arg247Cys and p.Arg63Cys, respectively), thus introducing a similar change in electrostatic charge [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR17"">17</xref>, <xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR42"">42</xref>]. Therefore, to avoid misinterpretation, suspected cases identified by IEF should be confirmed with molecular methods. This, along with the large number of variants that were classified as unidentified Null/rare, emphasizes the need for variant-specific testing methods, i.e., genotyping, alongside phenotypic analysis. The prevalence of the Z, S, F, and I variants were recently investigated in a large scale, gene-based screening program in the US and results showed that the F variant was reported to be more prevalent than the I variant [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR16"">16</xref>]. While our results support this finding, we found that the C and E variants were reported more frequently than the I variant in the US. The majority of the C and E variants identified were reported in a study that utilized IEF to determine AAT protein phenotypes in a sample of 72,229 patients in 2013 [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR46"">46</xref>]. However, it is known that some of the variants detectable by IEF do not correspond to specific mutations in <italic toggle=""yes"">SERPINA1</italic>. IEF is commonly utilized to determine AAT protein phenotypes based on their electrophoretic mobility, with AAT proteins originally being classified as slow (‘S’) or fast (‘F’) variants compared with the moderate mobility (‘M’) of the normal AAT protein [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR4"">4</xref>]. Consequently, AAT variants were historically classified from ‘A–Z’ based on their banding pattern. The variants that migrated faster through IEF gels were classified as ‘A–L’, depending on how close they were to the normal ‘M’ variant, whereas variants that migrated more slowly were classified as ‘N–Z’ [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR4"">4</xref>]. Once there were no unused letters for naming new variants, or the exact mutation was diagnosed by molecular tests, numerical figures and places of origin were added [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR17"">17</xref>]. Today, most genomic databases follow HGVS guidelines [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR28"">28</xref>], despite both patients and physicians being more familiar with the previous IEF-based nomenclature for AATD variants. Therefore, it is likely that many of the variants reported as C and E are in fact other <italic toggle=""yes"">SERPINA1</italic> variants that have since been genetically discerned and reported using different nomenclature, and may explain why these variants are reported only in certain countries and/or older publications. Further to this, there are several examples of where variants have likely been assigned different names depending on when/where they were first identified. The M<sub>N</sub> variant was first described in the Netherlands in 1976 and the term ‘M<sub>N</sub>’ was proposed based on its electrophoretic behavior [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR47"">47</xref>, <xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR48"">48</xref>]. However, as this variant was not reported anywhere else, it is likely that another name for the M<sub>N</sub> variant was subsequently used. Likewise, the AN variant was only identified in one article reporting allelic frequencies in an Andean Venezuelan population in 1996 [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR49"">49</xref>]. The authors did, however, note that the identity of the AN variant needed to be confirmed due to a similar IEF banding pattern to the F variant [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR49"">49</xref>]. Furthermore, the use of genetic-based identification methods has shown that some variants have the same mutation on different base alleles and, therefore, the same variant can have more than one name, adding further confusion to the AATD variant nomenclature. For example, the M<sub>Malton</sub> variant has a p.Phe76del mutation on the M2 base allele, whereas the M<sub>Nichinan</sub> and M<sub>Cagliari</sub> variants have the same mutation on the M1 base allele [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR50"">50</xref>]. The N<sub>Cambodia</sub> variant is also known as M1<sub>Pierre-bénite</sub> [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR51"">51</xref>, <xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR52"">52</xref>], M<sub>Würzburg</sub> is also called M<sub>Vall d’Hebron</sub> [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR53"">53</xref>, <xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR54"">54</xref>], and P<sub>Lowell</sub> is also called Q0<sub>Cardiff</sub>, P<sub>Durate</sub>, or Y<sub>Barcelona</sub> [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR25"">25</xref>]. Here, these variants have been reported separately, as they were reported in the literature. <italic toggle=""yes"">SERPINA1</italic> is a mutational hot spot and so some variants contain more than one mutation, such as Q0<sub>La Palma</sub> (p.Phe76del and p.Glu288Val) and the St. Albans variant (p.Asp280Asp and p.Asp365Asn) [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR4"">4</xref>, <xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR55"">55</xref>]. Adopting the use of HGVS guidelines would prevent confusion with describing currently known variants and the naming of new rare and novel variants, and would further our understanding of <italic toggle=""yes"">SERPINA1</italic> variation. A further issue is that despite HGVS guidelines existing to ensure consistent and unambiguous description of sequence variants [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR28"">28</xref>], it is still common in the AATD field to employ residue numbering according to the mature protein (i.e., without the first 24 residues of AAT’s signal peptide) [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR4"">4</xref>]. Here, we have followed HGVS guidelines and described variant residue numbering with the inclusion of AAT’s 24-residue signal peptide. To ensure consistent naming and description of <italic toggle=""yes"">SERPINA1</italic> variants and avoid confusion with AATD variant nomenclature, we call for others in the field of AATD to refrain from using the old convention and precisely follow HGVS guidelines. AATD was once thought of as a disease that affected patients of European decent only; however, current data shows that many countries have several rare variants within their population, irrespective of population ancestry. Today, we know that <italic toggle=""yes"">SERPINA1</italic> is a mutational hot spot and new rare variants arise irrespective of ancestry and geography. To aid identification of rare variants, a multiplex genotyping system has been developed to enable simultaneous identification of multiple AATD variants [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR24"">24</xref>]. However, due to regional variations, the multiplex genotyping system may show more utility in certain geographical regions than others, or at least, would require further integrative analysis in some populations. Out of the 14 variants that can be detected using the multiplex system, our results show that only half have been identified outside of Europe and North America (F, I, M<sub>Malton</sub>, P<sub>Lowell</sub>, Q0<sub>Bellingham</sub>, Q0<sub>Clayton</sub>, and S<sub>Iiyama</sub>), with only four having been found in Asia (F, I, Q0<sub>Claton</sub>, and S<sub>Iiyama</sub>) and three in Africa (F, I, and M<sub>Malton</sub>). The geographical differences in the number and/or types of rare AATD variants reported may likely be the product of several different factors. For example, some countries, particularly in the western world, place a greater emphasis on AATD research and diagnostic practices than others; as a result, this will likely influence the extent to which rare AATD variants are reported by these countries. Similarly, in countries with a history of isolation or lack of migration, endogamy or consanguinity may result in some variants being more prevalent than in countries with more population movement, and countries with smaller populations may result in certain variants being more concentrated. This is certainly a complex topic and continuing advancements in genetic testing and increased AATD awareness will contribute to the identification and reporting of different variants in countries across the world. It has been suggested that African populations could be a source of novel AATD variants due to the low prevalence of other, more common variants [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR55"">55</xref>, <xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR56"">56</xref>]. Our study identified 22 types of rare variant that have been reported in Africa. Seven of these variants are, so far, unique to African populations (E<sub>Johannesburg</sub>, E<sub>Tripoli</sub>, M<sub>Gam</sub>, Obernburg, S<sub>Berber</sub>, St. Albans, and W<sub>San</sub>), but due to global migration, we may begin to see further spread of these rare variants. This has been observed with the E<sub>Tokyo</sub> variant; a variant predominantly found in China and Japan [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR57"">57</xref>–<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR59"">59</xref>], which has also been reported in Switzerland [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR43"">43</xref>]. Therefore, there is a rationale to tailor expanded variant genotyping for multiple specific mutations, including rare variants. However, as testing for all known variants simultaneously is not practical and does not identify novel variants, ultimately, only genetic sequencing, which can identify any mutation, provides the most accurate picture of variant status. The majority of the AATD variants identified in this current literature search contain mutations that occur in the protein-coding region of <italic toggle=""yes"">SERPINA1</italic>; however, mutations that occur in regulatory regions may also severely impact gene expression and/or serum AAT protein levels [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR60"">60</xref>]. Therefore, gene sequencing, and if necessary, including introns as well, is recommended for any discordance between AAT serum levels and the reported genotype to obtain a definite AATD diagnosis. Moreover, some <italic toggle=""yes"">SERPINA1</italic> mutation may not have a direct impact upon serum AAT concentration, but may determine AAT protein functionality. Instances like this support the need for genetic sequencing to identify AATD variant status and correlate it to serum AAT levels, AAT functionality, and the clinical condition of the patient and/or their rate of lung function decline. One important implication of the findings reported herein is that there are many uncommon, rare variants associated with AATD reported worldwide. Further detection of rare variants may help identify more individuals with AATD and improve appropriate AATD diagnosis, enabling patients to receive timely and adequate treatment to help limit disease progression. The role of AAT therapy for patients with rare variants and low AAT serum level remains controversial given that no clinical proof of efficacy is available or on the horizon. Genetic testing that can effectively identify rare and novel AATD variants is crucial and should be used to support quantitative AAT testing [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR61"">61</xref>]. However, whole-gene sequencing of <italic toggle=""yes"">SERPINA1</italic> and next-generation sequencing can be costly. Testing for multiple variants simultaneously is a practical solution but is not a ‘one-size fits all’ solution to a disease with such global variation. Ideally, testing for multiple variants simultaneously should be adapted according to geographical region. Such data would provide further insight into the natural history and understanding of clinical phenotypes linked to specific variants, which is an endeavor that the European Alpha-1 Research Collaboration (EARCO) is committed to [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR22"">22</xref>]. The EARCO registry enrolls patients with AATD, including those with rare variants, providing prospective data on the clinical characteristics of these patients, and is open to all Investigators around the world caring for patients with AATD. AATD goes far beyond the most common Z and S variants, which dominate the literature in the field of AATD. Rare variants also play an important role in AATD, as demonstrated by their presence in patients from across the world. Our analysis highlights that comprehensive testing approaches are needed to ensure accurate AATD diagnosis, to optimize treatment strategies, particularly in terms of identifying patients who may benefit from AAT therapy. Ultimately, this could help to improve patient outcomes. AATD variants are reported inconsistently throughout the literature. Some are reported according to the original IEF-based nomenclature while others are reported according to partial or full HGVS guidelines. We therefore call for others in the field of AATD to adopt the most recent HGVS guidelines to avoid confusion over AATD variant nomenclature. Nomenclature alignment would also help to fully understand <italic toggle=""yes"">SERPINA1</italic> variability and assess the true extent of variant types in AATD. Finally, given the diversity of AATD variants that exists and the unlikelihood that clinical evidence for AAT therapy efficacy for each variant will become available, we underline the importance of correct molecular diagnosis of AATD to provide the basis for the best management and treatment options in view of precise medicine. However, this does require that there is standardized sequencing/reporting in the field of AATD. ",N/A,22 2 2024

Characteristics of alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency related lung disease exacerbations using a daily symptom diary and urinary biomarkers,,"Alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency (AATD) is an autosomal-codominant condition that predisposes to development of pulmonary emphysema, typically in a panlobular bibasal distribution. AATD related lung disease often presents earlier and with more modest smoking histories, than usual COPD. Pulmonary exacerbations of COPD in AATD contribute significantly to symptoms and quality of life (QOL) [<xref rid=""pone.0297125.ref001"" ref-type=""bibr"">1</xref>]. As with usual COPD, the heterogenous nature of the presentation and aetiology of such episodes makes developing targeted therapies challenging. Indeed, there have been no new therapies for treatment of acute exacerbations of COPD (AECOPD) or AATD related lung disease for more than thirty years. A recent research prioritisation exercise established ten research priorities in the field of COPD exacerbations [<xref rid=""pone.0297125.ref002"" ref-type=""bibr"">2</xref>]. Two of the highest ranked priorities were ‘What is the best way to tell the start of an exacerbation from day-to-day variation in symptoms?’ and ‘What is the best way to tell the difference between an exacerbation and a different cause of changing symptoms in a person with COPD?’. Cohort studies focusing on biomarkers fit this brief, since specific biomarker(s), in combination with a validated symptom score, could enable more precise identification and treatment of exacerbations [<xref rid=""pone.0297125.ref003"" ref-type=""bibr"">3</xref>]. For patients with AATD, where emphysema and physiological decline is more rapid, this may slow the rate of emphysema progression by reducing the associated inflammation [<xref rid=""pone.0297125.ref004"" ref-type=""bibr"">4</xref>]. Until recently, AECOPD were defined by symptom-based definitions or healthcare use, especially in clinical trials. Event-based definitions are indirect measures of exacerbations and do not include similar episodes that remain untreated (“unreported”) which may be twice as common [<xref rid=""pone.0297125.ref004"" ref-type=""bibr"">4</xref>, <xref rid=""pone.0297125.ref005"" ref-type=""bibr"">5</xref>]. More recently, patient reported outcome (PRO) tools have been developed to help characterise and quantify symptoms during exacerbations [<xref rid=""pone.0297125.ref006"" ref-type=""bibr"">6</xref>], largely in the context of randomised controlled trials where follow up is intensive and adherence constantly monitored. These trials have also focused on usual COPD and not AATD related lung disease where inflammation [<xref rid=""pone.0297125.ref007"" ref-type=""bibr"">7</xref>] and duration [<xref rid=""pone.0297125.ref008"" ref-type=""bibr"">8</xref>] of the episodes are greater. Few studies have validated PRO tools in this population [<xref rid=""pone.0297125.ref009"" ref-type=""bibr"">9</xref>]. One exception is Bronkotest [<xref rid=""pone.0297125.ref009"" ref-type=""bibr"">9</xref>, <xref rid=""pone.0297125.ref010"" ref-type=""bibr"">10</xref>] which, like other PRO scores for exacerbations [<xref rid=""pone.0297125.ref006"" ref-type=""bibr"">6</xref>], incorporates domains of the usual exacerbation symptoms in addition to “well-being” into a quantifiable symptom score [<xref rid=""pone.0297125.ref010"" ref-type=""bibr"">10</xref>]. Urinary biomarkers have yet to be explored in depth for AECOPD. Urine analysis is a simple and non-invasive way of measuring excretion of systemic biomarkers and is not dependent on sputum production and assessment. Elastin degradation pathways have showed promise as candidate biomarkers of disease activity and exacerbations [<xref rid=""pone.0297125.ref011"" ref-type=""bibr"">11</xref>–<xref rid=""pone.0297125.ref013"" ref-type=""bibr"">13</xref>], in addition to more conventional measures of inflammation [<xref rid=""pone.0297125.ref014"" ref-type=""bibr"">14</xref>]. The current study aimed to characterise AECOPD in frequent exacerbators with AATD related lung disease using an eDiary and a point of care (POC) urinary biomarker measurement device. We set out to explore the relationship of Anthonisen defined exacerbations with changes in urinary biomarkers of elastin degradation and inflammation and hypothesised the concentration of such biomarkers would increase during an AECOPD and return toward baseline value upon symptom recovery. We also aimed to determine if such enhanced monitoring of patients could accurately predict Anthonisen defined AECOPD events compared with physician assessment of symptoms alone. Feasibility of eDiary and POC urine monitors was determined by their implementation into real-world patients without the intensive follow up typical of randomised controlled trials. This should be informative for development and roll out of medical devices or patient facing tools which aid AECOPD recognition and management. This analysis reviewed daily symptom diary data over an 18-month period with regular monitoring of urinary biomarkers from a cohort of 55 severe AATD patients recruited to the Elastin degradation in exacerbations of AATD related lung disease study (REC 16/WA/0352, approved by the Health and Care Research Wales). Written consent was gained for all participants. Each patient had a primary diagnosis of COPD confirmed with spirometry (FEV<sub>1</sub>/FVC ratio <0.7/LLN) and received standard COPD care in line with the GOLD strategy [<xref rid=""pone.0297125.ref001"" ref-type=""bibr"">1</xref>]. Patients with a history and diagnosis of asthma were excluded. Participants were recruited between January 2017 and March 2018 from AATD clinics and registry in Birmingham, UK. The eDiary device (Kindle Fire HD 8"", sixth generation) and a POC urine lateral flow assay device (Headstart®, Mologic, Bedfordshire, UK) were issued to patients during the baseline visit with appropriate training. Each eDiary device was preloaded with the Take Part application, an electronic form of the validated paper Bronkotest diary [<xref rid=""pone.0297125.ref009"" ref-type=""bibr"">9</xref>]. S1 Table in <xref rid=""pone.0297125.s002"" ref-type=""supplementary-material"">S1 File</xref> provides a breakdown of the symptom score domains and weighting. Patients were asked to complete the eDiary daily. Participants were instructed to use the POC urine lateral flow assay device (known as a ‘urine cube’) on a weekly basis during periods of stable symptoms and for 7 consecutive days from the first day of an exacerbation. The urine cube collected and stored optical density (OD) data from a lateral flow assay measuring alpha-1 antitrypsin (AAT), neutrophil elastase (NE), tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases 1 (TIMP1), C-reactive Protein (CRP) and desmosine. DataReader Software was used to extract measurements from the urine cube at study visits and on completion. Upon study completion, participants completed a short questionnaire assessing the usability of the urine cube. Baseline characteristics of all patients are in <xref rid=""pone.0297125.t001"" ref-type=""table"">Table 1</xref>. Overall, adherence was 68% for daily symptom diary testing over a median follow up of 17.8 months (IQR 2.8). For those with >50% adherence (n = 38) this increased to 76.1% with a median follow up period of 13.6 months (IQR 7.1). A sensitivity analysis was performed that excluded patients with less than 90 entries (representing ≥3 months of data) to remove noncompliers or those using the eDiary for a short period. In this group, 49% of data was missing suggesting compliance decreased the longer the patient used the eDiary. The majority of patients scored the device as “very easy” or “easy”. This study is the first to combine daily symptom diary data with regular urine measurement of putative biomarkers of AECOPD in patients with AATD and the largest of treated and untreated exacerbations in AATD. In general, publications relating to exacerbations in AATD are few compared to those in usual COPD [<xref rid=""pone.0297125.ref018"" ref-type=""bibr"">18</xref>]. Data from the current study has shown that symptoms develop rapidly, typically within 48 hours as seen in usual COPD [<xref rid=""pone.0297125.ref019"" ref-type=""bibr"">19</xref>]. Treated exacerbations have also been shown to have a higher symptom burden as with usual COPD [<xref rid=""pone.0297125.ref019"" ref-type=""bibr"">19</xref>]. Results confirmed Anthonisen Type I exacerbations are longer in duration, are treated more often and have a higher symptom burden, in keeping with a previous study that documented exacerbations in a sub cohort of patients enrolled as part of a randomised controlled trial of inhaled AAT therapy [<xref rid=""pone.0297125.ref009"" ref-type=""bibr"">9</xref>]. The burden of untreated exacerbations within frequent exacerbators with AATD related lung disease was also confirmed in a real-world setting where 45% of all Anthonisen Type I exacerbations were untreated. This may be of particular concern in AATD patients who are known to have higher levels of inflammation (and proteinase activity) especially during exacerbations associated with purulent (elastase positive) sputum compared with usual COPD [<xref rid=""pone.0297125.ref007"" ref-type=""bibr"">7</xref>]. This could result in short episodes of excessive lung damage [<xref rid=""pone.0297125.ref020"" ref-type=""bibr"">20</xref>] hence prompt treatment should be encouraged. Our results build on findings from Needham et al [<xref rid=""pone.0297125.ref021"" ref-type=""bibr"">21</xref>] who identified differences in exacerbation duration and rate occurring in autumn and winter compared with warmer seasons. This could provide evidence for the rationalisation of drugs used to reduce/prevent exacerbations during the summer months in AATD, such as reserving long-term macrolide therapy for winter months only. It also suggests viruses as a factor for exacerbations in AATD related lung disease since these are more prevalent during autumn and winter. Deriving a Bronkotest score threshold to represent an exacerbation in AATD would enable early recognition of exacerbations in real time. EXACT-PRO [<xref rid=""pone.0297125.ref006"" ref-type=""bibr"">6</xref>, <xref rid=""pone.0297125.ref022"" ref-type=""bibr"">22</xref>–<xref rid=""pone.0297125.ref024"" ref-type=""bibr"">24</xref>], which uses 2 or 3 days of consecutive increase in symptoms with a difference of 12 or 9 points respectively to define an exacerbation, uses this concept but has only been validated in non-AATD COPD. EXACT-PRO has been approved by regulators as an acceptable outcome suitable for clinical trials in exacerbation studies [<xref rid=""pone.0297125.ref025"" ref-type=""bibr"">25</xref>], and having the equivalent simpler but validated tool in AATD would also be useful for future trials of therapies impacting on unreported/untreated episodes [<xref rid=""pone.0297125.ref026"" ref-type=""bibr"">26</xref>]. In a real-world setting, meeting a symptom score threshold as well as its characteristics should trigger the patient to seek medical advice and/or take back up therapy [<xref rid=""pone.0297125.ref027"" ref-type=""bibr"">27</xref>]. Regardless of the performance of any symptom score, the technology needs to be acceptable to patients in a real-world setting over long periods of time. Our study has provided data supporting feasibility of using an eDiary for up to 18 months although adherence wanes over time. The use of biomarkers to help strengthen the predictive ability of symptom diaries is an attractive concept. This could define precision medicine [<xref rid=""pone.0297125.ref028"" ref-type=""bibr"">28</xref>] in treatment of AECOPD by either alerting patients to a potentially damaging exacerbation or by avoiding oral corticosteroids or antibiotics for episodes that are related to physiological changes alone. Though our results showed some effects on averaged data across the entire cohort during exacerbations, urinary biomarkers were unable to mimic or improve the predictive value of the Bronkotest eDiary. A larger cohort size or better urine cube adherence may have improved the predictability. It was notable that Type I exacerbations were associated with a stronger signal for CRP, supporting the concept that not all exacerbations are associated with increased inflammation [<xref rid=""pone.0297125.ref029"" ref-type=""bibr"">29</xref>] and that antibiotics should be aimed at those with purulent sputum. This is especially important in AATD related COPD where increased inflammation from an exacerbation could accelerate emphysema decline [<xref rid=""pone.0297125.ref008"" ref-type=""bibr"">8</xref>]. The original Anthonisen randomised control trial found that patients with Type I episodes benefited most from antibiotic treatment compared to placebo [<xref rid=""pone.0297125.ref016"" ref-type=""bibr"">16</xref>]. A recent systematic review found moderate evidence that serum CRP was related to bacterial AECOPD [<xref rid=""pone.0297125.ref030"" ref-type=""bibr"">30</xref>], though most studies were small with major heterogeneity. The future of biomarker research currently remains uncertain. The Framington risk score, for example, is successful in predicting future risk of cardiovascular disease at the population level with many biomarkers having strong associations with future cardiovascular events or death [<xref rid=""pone.0297125.ref031"" ref-type=""bibr"">31</xref>]. However, the same biomarkers have so far failed to change the AUC to a meaningful extent in prediction models on an individual basis, leading to current pessimism. The same may prove to be the case in AECOPD although more targeted concepts and media remain worthy of further study. AECOPD in AATD share some similarities to those observed in usual COPD with a significant burden of unreported exacerbations that may impact health status. Use of an eDiary is feasible to detect and partially characterise such episodes over prolonged periods of time and provide educational patient feedback. This, alongside use of a POC urine device to measure biomarkers of AECOPD, may pave the way for precision medicine. These pioneering results must be validated by more powerful studies. ",N/A,2 2 2024
Alpha-1-antitrypsin-deficiency is associated with lower cardiovascular risk: an approach based on federated learning,,"Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is an inflammatory and multifactorial disease [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR1"">1</xref>], according to the World Health Organization data, it is the third leading cause of mortality worldwide [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR2"">2</xref>]. The COPD phenotype results from the complex interplay of environmental, health and genetic risk factors [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR1"">1</xref>]. A typical COPD patient often suffers from one or more comorbidities, specifically cardiovascular diseases (CVDs). There are many similarities between COPD and CVD and there are common risk factors, the most important of which is cigarette smoking. Persistent systemic inflammation, increased senescence, changes in the microbiome, and/or a genetic predisposition are determinants for coexistent comorbidities, such as CVDs but also osteoporosis, intellectual deterioration, muscle hypotrophy and cachexia [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR1"">1</xref>, <xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR3"">3</xref>, <xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR4"">4</xref>]. Therefore, one of the goals of COPD research is to recognize disease phenotypes and to develop biomarkers that enable clinicians to identify individuals with increased risk for comorbidities and mortality, and those in need of a more intensive personalized treatment. Inherited Alpha-1-Antitrypsin-Deficiency (AATD) is a genetic predisposition to COPD and pulmonary emphysema that affects 0.01–0.02% of the population in Europe and that makes the lungs more vulnerable to inhaled harmful particles [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR5"">5</xref>–<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR7"">7</xref>]. The most common AATD genotypes are Pi*Z (Glu342Lys) and Pi*S (Glu264Val) resulting from a point mutation in the SERPINA 1 gene encoding the alpha-1antitrypsin (AAT) protein, a broad-spectrum protease inhibitor and immunomodulatory protein [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR8"">8</xref>–<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR11"">11</xref>]. The Pi*Z mutation in the SERPINA1 gene leads to AAT polymerization, intracellular accumulation, and low circulating levels of AAT [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR12"">12</xref>–<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR15"">15</xref>]. As mentioned above, COPD patients have a high prevalence of cardiovascular risk factors and comorbidities [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR17"">17</xref>]. However, knowledge about the prevalence of CVDs in patients with AATD-related emphysema remains limited and controversial. Greulich et al. [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR16"">16</xref>] evaluated health insurance data, unadjusted for important confounders such as smoking status, age, gender and body mass index (BMI), and showed a significantly lower cardiovascular risk and comorbidity profile in COPD patients with AATD compared to those without AATD. In a large prospective German multicentre cohort study (COSYCONET), the authors considered smoking, age, gender, and BMI as confounding factors of COPD and investigated comorbidities in stable COPD patients with and without AATD [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR17"">17</xref>]. Here, in line with the previous study, the authors reported that patients with AATD-related COPD have a significantly lower prevalence for cardiovascular comorbidities. In contrast, a recent study from US insurance databases did not identify significant lower prevalence of cardiovascular comorbidities associated with AATD-related COPD [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR18"">18</xref>]. Therefore, the aim of this study was to investigate in non-AATD and AATD COPD patients: (i) comorbidity profile (ii) high sensitivity troponin (hs-troponin) and (iii) blood glucose and lipid profiles. For this purpose, we analysed data in a real-life setting obtained from six medical centres of the Medical Informatics in Research and Care in University Medicine (MIRACUM) consortium [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR19"">19</xref>].   This is the first study on AATD related COPD integrating data from several university hospitals in a distributed analysis approach utilizing the technical infrastructure of the MIRACUM data integration centres. Moreover, the MIRACUM database allowed the reassessment of plasma cardiac hs-troponin, as a major indicator of cardiovascular events and an independent predictor for mortality in patients with COPD [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR31"">31</xref>]. First, we confirmed the already known relationship between AATD and an increased prevalence of bronchiectasis [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR17"">17</xref>, <xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR32"">32</xref>]. On the other hand, our data revealed that AATD-related COPD patients have a much lower risk of a cardiovascular disease than non-AATD COPD patients. Accordingly, the prevalence of acute ischemic stroke, angina pectoris, arrhythmias, atrial fibrillation, carotid stenosis, coronary heart diseases, ischemic heart, liver diseases and cardiac infarction were significantly lower than in individuals with non-AATD COPD. Our findings are also in line with data reported by Greulich et al. The authors also found lower cardiovascular comorbidity profiles in COPD patients with AATD by examining health insurance data, however, without accounting for the confounding factors like age, nicotine abuse and BMI [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR16"">16</xref>]. The German prospective multicentre study COSYCONET also found a significantly lower prevalence of cardiovascular disease in AATD-related COPD patients [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR17"">17</xref>]. Although the COSYCONET results were based on the adjustment of age, gender, BMI and pack years of cigarettes, patient selection bias cannot be totally excluded because significantly younger AATD patients were enrolled due to family screening. Unlike in the COSYCONET cohort study, we only considered patients having COPD as a primary or secondary diagnosis. Despite the above differences in study designs, previously published [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR16"">16</xref>, <xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR17"">17</xref>] and current data support the notion that AATD-related COPD patients have a lower risk for cardiovascular diseases than Non-AATD COPD patients. The question remains why? According to the COSYCONET study, lower cardiovascular comorbidities in AATD than in non-AATD COPD patients can be associated with significantly lower plasma triglyceride concentrations and lower HbA1c in COPD patients with AATD [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR17"">17</xref>]. In contrast to the results of COSYCONET, we could not confirm that the long-term blood sugar parameter HbA1c is reduced in AATD COPD [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR17"">17</xref>]. A possible explanation for these conflicting findings could be that our current study is based on the larger patient cohort, which includes older individuals with AATD than in COSYCONET. On the other hand, our findings are in line with Bhattacharjee et al. who did not find a lower HbA1c in AATD patients with hepatic insufficiency [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR33"">33</xref>]. Recently, Hamesch et al. [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR34"">34</xref>] showed that Pi*ZZ AATD individuals have lower serum concentrations of LDL, VLDL and triglyceride, and related this finding to hepatic damage caused by intracellular accumulation of misfolded Z-AAT protein. These authors also provided evidence that Pi*Z-overexpressing mice have reduced expression of genes involved in lipid secretion and develop liver steatosis [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR34"">34</xref>]. Our results revealed that plasma levels of total cholesterol are lower in patients with AATD, but not in terms of LDL cholesterol, HDL cholesterol and triglycerides (routinely measured serum total cholesterol is a sum of lipoprotein particles with high, low, intermediate and very low density (HDL, LDL, IDL a VLDL). Out of these, VLDL particles are almost exclusively synthesized in the liver and secreted into the bloodstream. IDL and LDL particles are derived from VLDL after the loss of free fatty acids. HDL particles are also largely produced in the liver, but their production in the small intestine is also important [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR35"">35</xref>]. Because liver diseases lead to a decrease in serum levels of cholesterol and triglycerides [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR36"">36</xref>], this might explain why individuals with AATD - which is often associated with liver disease [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR37"">37</xref>] - have lower levels of total cholesterol. In fact, lower cholesterol levels are in turn associated with a lower risk of cardiovascular diseases [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR38"">38</xref>]. Patients with AATD have a more vulnerable liver, indicated by the elevated liver transaminases ASAT and ALAT, which were significantly higher in patients with AATD in this study. This is congruent with the results of COSYCONET that confirmed lower levels of total cholesterol and a lower prevalence of cardiovascular comorbidities in individuals with AATD [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR17"">17</xref>]. Patients with AATD might secrete less total-cholesterol due to the accumulation of misfolded AAT in the hepatocytes and thus might have a lower prevalence of cardiovascular comorbidities. Contrary to expectations, the real life data showed fewer liver diseases in patients with AATD than in COPD patients without AATD. The lower prevalence of liver disease in AATD is most likely due to bias, since it is undisputed that individuals with AATD show a higher association with liver disease [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR37"">37</xref>]. A very likely reason could be that the liver diseases were not always recorded in the hospital bills, especially since only diagnoses that lead to increased reimbursement by the health insurance companies are coded. This also shows that the coded data should always be interpreted from the point of view of coding practice, which is a limitation of such big data studies. Another reason could also be the lack of awareness in clinical routine that AATD can also be a disease of the liver [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR39"">39</xref>]. For this reason, available laboratory values should also be included in the interpretation, such as the elevated transaminases ALAT and ASAT in AATD as done in our study. Moreover, the evaluation of ‘big data’ in MIRACUM is also suitable for the analysis of the biomarker hs-troponin in terms of prediction of mortality in individuals with COPD. We confirmed the results of Waschki et al. from the German prospective cohort study COSYCONET, that hs-troponin is a suitable biomarker for estimating mortality in subjects with stable COPD. While Waschki et al. examined subjects with stable COPD, we were able to analyse real life data that also includes patients with exacerbated COPD. We conclude that the concept of MIRACUM is feasible for the analysis of a large healthcare database that provided important data, especially for orphan diseases. We have proved evidence that COPD patients with AATD have a lower cardiovascular risk. In addition, our real world data showed that hs-troponin is a predictor for hospital mortality in patients with COPD. ",N/A,18 1 2024

We aim to investigate the prevalence of CVD and the relationship between exacerbation frequency and future rates of MACE for patients with severe AATD-related COPD. We analysed cardiovascular disease prevalence and associations of major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE), with particular focus on the frequent exacerbator phenotype (≥2 exacerbations per year), in adult patients (age ≥18 years) with severe AATD (PiZZ or other rarer phenotypes with severe AATD) with COPD from two prospective AATD cohorts: AlphaNet, based in the USA, and the Birmingham AATD registry, UK. Methods for data collection in both cohorts have been summarised previously.<xref rid=""cit0020"" ref-type=""bibr"">20</xref>   The main strength of this study is the large number of severe AATD patients with well characterised baseline and follow-up data, the largest studied to date. We acknowledge several limitations of this study. The most significant limitation is lack of a comparator non-AATD group which was not available for this analysis. In addition, the presence of COPD in AlphaNet was largely self-reported.<xref rid=""cit0055"" ref-type=""bibr"">55</xref> A prerequisite for AAT prescription in the United States is presence of AATD-related lung disease, though we acknowledge that a small number of patients may not have met physiological criteria for COPD. The methods with which data were collected in both cohorts were slightly different, though this is unlikely to change the reported prevalence or incidence of cardiovascular disease and MACE, respectively. The definition of MACE did not include cardiovascular-related death, and therefore some MACE were not captured. We have demonstrated that there were more deaths in patients with prior cardiovascular disease and in frequent exacerbators, which suggests that if data on cardiovascular death were available it may strengthen our findings. We also performed a competing risk analysis which demonstrated a higher risk of MACE in frequent exacerbators, and it is likely that a proportion of deaths were cardiovascular deaths and therefore MACE underestimated. In addition, some MACE were self-reported. There were high levels of missing data for key variables including FEV<sub>1</sub>% predicted and prevalence of ischaemic heart disease and hypercholesterolaemia in the US cohort. Sensitivity analyses were used to mitigate against these issues, though these were limited by reduced number of MACE. Notably, data were not captured for family history of cardiovascular disease or smoking pack year history. In severe AATD-COPD, MACE are associated with increased exacerbation frequency, previous cardiovascular disease, and a history of smoking. Further studies examining the relationship between pulmonary exacerbations and cardiovascular disease are needed to further clarify the risk of cardiovascular disease in severe AATD-COPD, in addition to a comparison to matched non-AATD COPD patients.",N/A,17 1 2024
The Expanding Scope of Alpha 1 Antitrypsin Deficiency,," There is an abundance of evidence reporting the protective role of AAT in preserving arterial wall integrity and the regulation of inflammatory processes. Reduced AAT levels result in overactive proteases, leading to the amplification of MMPs such as MMP-9, and the increased destructive action on the ECM and elastin of the aortic wall. Data show there is a pathological association between AAT and the development of aortic distention, with age as a driving factor. AAT is genetically highly polymorphic with multiple alleles influencing serum levels, and its functionality. A pathological association is evident between different AAT alleles, with respect to vascular disease and the coexistence of emphysema, as well as aortic and cerebral aneurysms. It is, therefore, important to consider the expanding scope of AATD, and patients with this condition should be monitored for cardiovascular implications.
