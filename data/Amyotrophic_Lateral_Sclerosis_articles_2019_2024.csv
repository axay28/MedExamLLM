","Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) was characterized by Jean‐Martin Charcot (1825–1893) as a progressive syndrome involving the combined degeneration of upper motor neurons of the corticospinal tract and lower motor neurons of the brain stem and anterior spinal cord. The resulting progressive skeletal muscle weakness strongly underpins the median survival of 30 months from the onset of symptoms (Westeneng et al. <xref rid=""brb370115-bib-0135"" ref-type=""bibr"">2018</xref>). The categorization of ALS as solely a disorder of voluntary movement has been revealed as an oversimplification. ALS has clinical, pathological, and genetic overlap with frontotemporal dementia (FTD), with a shared signature of neuronal and glial cytoplasmic inclusions of TDP‐43 (Neumann et al. <xref rid=""brb370115-bib-0095"" ref-type=""bibr"">2006</xref>). The emergence of an anterior brain component to ALS pathology goes back more than a century (reviewed in Turner and Swash <xref rid=""brb370115-bib-0130"" ref-type=""bibr"">2015</xref>). Early neuropsychological studies reporting cognitive impairments in ALS (Gallassi et al. <xref rid=""brb370115-bib-0058"" ref-type=""bibr"">1985</xref>) have developed over the last four decades into a more complex picture encompassing both cognitive and behavioral components within a multisystem syndrome (Abrahams <xref rid=""brb370115-bib-0004"" ref-type=""bibr"">2023</xref>). The precise distinction of the terms cognitive and behavioral is debatable, but in recognizing the broader phenotypic spectrum, consensus criteria involving both terms have been established for the conceptualization and diagnosis of frontotemporal dysfunction in ALS (Strong et al. <xref rid=""brb370115-bib-0121"" ref-type=""bibr"">2017</xref>; Table <xref rid=""brb370115-tbl-0001"" ref-type=""table"">1</xref>). Estimates of the prevalence of cognitive dysfunction in ALS have varied considerably from 16% to 65% (Rusina, Vandenberghe, and Bruffaerts <xref rid=""brb370115-bib-0114"" ref-type=""bibr"">2021</xref>; McMillan et al. <xref rid=""brb370115-bib-0086"" ref-type=""bibr"">2022</xref>). The extent of cognitive dysfunction is also highly diverse, spanning a spectrum from mild cognitive impairment to overt FTD. The proposed continuity of this spectrum remains the subject of debate (Rusina, Vandenberghe, and Bruffaerts <xref rid=""brb370115-bib-0114"" ref-type=""bibr"">2021</xref>). A proportion (10%) of those diagnosed with ALS according to motor features will have concurrent FTD with a strikingly similar neuropsychological profile to that of behavioral‐variant FTD (Strong et al. <xref rid=""brb370115-bib-0123"" ref-type=""bibr"">2009</xref>). However, frontotemporal deficits in executive functioning and language are also common in ALS with only mild cognitive dysfunction (Goldstein and Abrahams <xref rid=""brb370115-bib-0060"" ref-type=""bibr"">2013</xref>; Rusina, Vandenberghe, and Bruffaerts <xref rid=""brb370115-bib-0114"" ref-type=""bibr"">2021</xref>). The most consistent cognitive faculty to deteriorate in ALS is verbal fluency, and more specifically, letter fluency, also known as phonemic fluency. Often measured by the ALS‐adapted verbal fluency index, letter fluency deficit is characterized by protracted ‘thinking time’ in order to generate words that begin with a specific letter (Abrahams et al. <xref rid=""brb370115-bib-0006"" ref-type=""bibr"">2000</xref>; Abrahams <xref rid=""brb370115-bib-0004"" ref-type=""bibr"">2023</xref>). Deficits in executive functioning (e.g., working memory, attention, and social cognition) and language (e.g., spelling and naming) are also common cognitive manifestations in ALS (Abrahams <xref rid=""brb370115-bib-0002"" ref-type=""bibr"">2013</xref>; Kasper et al. <xref rid=""brb370115-bib-0070"" ref-type=""bibr"">2015</xref>; Bora <xref rid=""brb370115-bib-0017"" ref-type=""bibr"">2017</xref>; Ceslis et al. <xref rid=""brb370115-bib-0031"" ref-type=""bibr"">2020</xref>; Pinto‐Grau et al. <xref rid=""brb370115-bib-0103"" ref-type=""bibr"">2021</xref>; Palumbo et al. <xref rid=""brb370115-bib-0101"" ref-type=""bibr"">2022</xref>). Notably, letter fluency relies on several executive function processes, and although it is a sensitive test of cognitive dysfunction in ALS disease, the precise reason for this remains elusive (Abrahams <xref rid=""brb370115-bib-0004"" ref-type=""bibr"">2023</xref>). Behavioral abnormalities in ALS may manifest either in isolation or alongside cognitive impairment, classified as ALSbi and ALScbi, respectively. In an analogous fashion to cognitive dysfunction, ALSbi may show behavioral abnormalities resembling the behavioral variant FTD neuropsychological profile, including apathy or at least two symptoms of disinhibition, perseverative behavior, loss of empathy, and hyperorality. Of these, apathy is by far the most commonly reported symptom in ALS affecting up to a third of individuals, as either self‐reported or by a close friend, relative, or caregiver (Kutlubaev et al. <xref rid=""brb370115-bib-0073"" ref-type=""bibr"">2023</xref>). Apathy is itself a multidimensional syndrome with three major subtypes: initiation, emotional, and executive apathy, defined, respectively, as a lack of motivation for self‐generation of thoughts, emotional, and goal‐directed behaviors (Radakovic et al. <xref rid=""brb370115-bib-0109"" ref-type=""bibr"">2016</xref>). Initiation apathy has emerged as the dominant subtype associated with ALS, although emotional blunting and problems in goal management are not uncommon behavioral manifestations of the disease (Radakovic et al. <xref rid=""brb370115-bib-0108"" ref-type=""bibr"">2020</xref>; Caga et al. <xref rid=""brb370115-bib-0028"" ref-type=""bibr"">2021</xref>). The ability to identify those with ALS at risk of developing cognitive and behavioral impairment and to better predict their disease course would hold significant medical and psychosocial benefits. Cognitive dysfunction is associated with both reduced patient quality of life and additional caregiver burden (Burke et al. <xref rid=""brb370115-bib-0023"" ref-type=""bibr"">2015</xref>; Bock et al. <xref rid=""brb370115-bib-0016"" ref-type=""bibr"">2017</xref>). Behavioral change and in particular apathy and disinhibition have also been identified as predictors of high caregiver burden, even more so than physical disability (Lillo, Mioshi, and Hodges <xref rid=""brb370115-bib-0076"" ref-type=""bibr"">2012</xref>; Burke et al. <xref rid=""brb370115-bib-0023"" ref-type=""bibr"">2015</xref>; Caga et al. <xref rid=""brb370115-bib-0027"" ref-type=""bibr"">2019</xref>). Hence, being able to better predict ALS‐related neuropsychological dysfunction could inform advanced decision making and care planning directives. Mechanistically, clinicopathological research studies may also unveil novel pathways for ALS‐specific decline as well as therapeutic candidates with important ramifications for clinical trial enrollment. The relationship between cognitive dysfunction and ALS raises important questions with implications for care. Are particular ALS clinical phenotypes more or less associated with cognitive impairment? Does cognitive status remain stable after diagnosis, or do individuals experience decline, and how might this affect their survival? Current evidence addressing these questions arises predominantly from cross‐sectional studies together with some longitudinal cognitive assessment study paradigms. Numerous screening tools have been devised to assess general behavioral disturbance in ALS, including the ALS‐FTD‐Q questionnaire (Raaphorst et al. <xref rid=""brb370115-bib-0107"" ref-type=""bibr"">2012</xref>) and the Beaumont Behavioural Inventory (Elamin et al. <xref rid=""brb370115-bib-0049"" ref-type=""bibr"">2017</xref>). The Dimensional Apathy Scale has been validated as a reliable and rapid multidimensional assessment of the most prevalent behavioral symptom in ALS (Radakovic et al. <xref rid=""brb370115-bib-0109"" ref-type=""bibr"">2016</xref>). The assessment tool, which can be completed by patients, caregivers, healthcare professionals, or researchers, has been used more recently to investigate clinical correlates of apathy and its subtypes. Apathy has been associated with cognitive impairment in ALS. Initiation apathy in particular has been strongly correlated with impaired performance in verbal fluency, the most consistent cognitive deficit in ALS (Grossman et al. <xref rid=""brb370115-bib-0062"" ref-type=""bibr"">2007</xref>; Witgert et al. <xref rid=""brb370115-bib-0140"" ref-type=""bibr"">2010</xref>; Radakovic et al. <xref rid=""brb370115-bib-0110"" ref-type=""bibr"">2017</xref>; Kutlubaev et al. <xref rid=""brb370115-bib-0073"" ref-type=""bibr"">2023</xref>). The common etiological basis of this is yet to be fully elucidated, but shared networks, including the dorsolateral prefrontal, inferior, and orbitofrontal cortices, as well as the cingulum, have been postulated as having overlapping functionality across the two faculties (Abrahams <xref rid=""brb370115-bib-0004"" ref-type=""bibr"">2023</xref>). Similarly, one study also found emotional apathy to be significantly associated with emotional recognition on the Ekman 60 Faces talk (Radakovic et al. <xref rid=""brb370115-bib-0110"" ref-type=""bibr"">2017</xref>). As with cognitive dysfunction, an association between behavioral change and bulbar dysfunction is contentious, with several studies concluding in favor (Santangelo et al. <xref rid=""brb370115-bib-0116"" ref-type=""bibr"">2017</xref>; Kutlubaev et al. <xref rid=""brb370115-bib-0073"" ref-type=""bibr"">2023</xref>) and against (Lillo et al. <xref rid=""brb370115-bib-0077"" ref-type=""bibr"">2011</xref>; Consonni et al. <xref rid=""brb370115-bib-0036"" ref-type=""bibr"">2019</xref>). Proposed associations between apathy and depression or other mood disorders are equally as conflicting, although a recent meta‐analysis concluded no clear correlation (Kutlubaev et al. <xref rid=""brb370115-bib-0073"" ref-type=""bibr"">2023</xref>). There is a general lack of longitudinal studies that comprehensively analyze and track the progression of behavioral symptoms. However, at least two studies conclude behavioral impairment to be progressive either in tandem with (Beeldman et al. <xref rid=""brb370115-bib-0011"" ref-type=""bibr"">2020</xref>) or independently of (Woolley et al. <xref rid=""brb370115-bib-0141"" ref-type=""bibr"">2018</xref>) apparent cognitive deterioration. Although there is evidence to suggest that the severity of behavior symptoms increases, it remains unknown whether the specific types of behavioral symptoms increase or change over time (i.e., does disinhibition decrease as apathy increases). The presence of behavioral symptoms, including apathy, and even the level of apathy, appears to correlate with worsened ALS prognosis (Hu et al. <xref rid=""brb370115-bib-0064"" ref-type=""bibr"">2013</xref>; Caga et al. <xref rid=""brb370115-bib-0029"" ref-type=""bibr"">2016</xref>; Nguyen et al. <xref rid=""brb370115-bib-0096"" ref-type=""bibr"">2021</xref>; Kutlubaev et al. <xref rid=""brb370115-bib-0073"" ref-type=""bibr"">2023</xref>). Of note and by contrast, one study reported a longer disease duration in those with ALSbi, suggesting that such changes might be more likely to be reported in the later stages of disease (Consonni et al. <xref rid=""brb370115-bib-0036"" ref-type=""bibr"">2019</xref>). There appears to be no consistent correlation between apathy and disease stage (Caga et al. <xref rid=""brb370115-bib-0029"" ref-type=""bibr"">2016</xref>; Kutlubaev et al. <xref rid=""brb370115-bib-0073"" ref-type=""bibr"">2023</xref>). Likewise, few studies have examined the onset of behavioral symptoms and how these change over time in ALS. Symptoms of disinhibition, perseveration, and apathy have been reported in the early stages of the disease, and in some cases, even before motor symptom onset, based on retrospective reporting (Mioshi et al. <xref rid=""brb370115-bib-0089"" ref-type=""bibr"">2014</xref>). Investigating these symptoms longitudinally in asymptomatic at‐risk individuals is needed to further our understanding of whether specific symptoms occur in the prodromal stages of the disease and if certain behavioral profiles are associated with progression to ALS without significant extramotor involvement, FTD, or ALS–FTD. The hallmark pathological feature of 97% of ALS cases is motor neuronal and glial cell cytoplasmic inclusions of a 43 kDa transactive response DNA‐binding protein, TDP‐43. It is predominantly localized to the nucleus in a steady state, but in ALS, it undergoes nuclear clearance, including several aberrant post‐translational modifications that appear to contribute to cytoplasmic mislocalization and aggregation (Suk and Rousseaux <xref rid=""brb370115-bib-0146"" ref-type=""bibr"">2020</xref>). Recapitulating TDP‐43 dysfunction in animal models has become an important focus of research for investigating the motor consequences of TDP‐43 proteinopathy. However, comparatively little research has explored a possible relationship between TDP‐43 and cognitive and behavioral impairment in ALS, primarily due to a lack of validated tools for evaluating TDP‐43 in vivo (Buciuc et al. <xref rid=""brb370115-bib-0022"" ref-type=""bibr"">2020</xref>). The most compelling evidence for a link is that TDP‐43 is also the principal component of inclusions in ∼50% of frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD) cases (FTLD–TDP) and the vast majority of FTLD–ALS cases (Irwin et al. <xref rid=""brb370115-bib-0066"" ref-type=""bibr"">2015</xref>; Kawakami, Arai, and Hasegawa <xref rid=""brb370115-bib-0071"" ref-type=""bibr"">2019</xref>). This suggests a potential continuum from mild cognitive and behavioral impairment in motor‐predominant ALS to frank FTD at the other extreme, in agreement with a large retrospective study that identified an FTLD neuropathological pattern to be the greatest correlate of cognitive impairment in ALS (Borrego‐Écija et al. <xref rid=""brb370115-bib-0018"" ref-type=""bibr"">2021</xref>). Pathological TDP‐43 deposition has also been associated with cognitive impairment in the absence of FTLD. The recently described limbic‐predominant age‐related TDP‐43 encephalopathy (LATE), which has a more restricted anatomical distribution of TDP‐43 proteinopathy within the temporal lobe, is also associated with substantial amnestic‐like cognitive impairment (Nelson et al. <xref rid=""brb370115-bib-0093"" ref-type=""bibr"">2019</xref>). LATE designation is, however, controversial. Some pathologists cite insufficient evidence for it being a distinct pathology from Alzheimer's disease and FTLD (Josephs et al. <xref rid=""brb370115-bib-0069"" ref-type=""bibr"">2019</xref>). Furthermore, individuals with non‐TDP‐43 neurodegenerative disease exhibiting concomitant TDP‐43 pathology demonstrate increased severity of cognitive impairment compared to those without (Wilson et al. <xref rid=""brb370115-bib-0138"" ref-type=""bibr"">2013</xref>; Meneses et al. <xref rid=""brb370115-bib-0088"" ref-type=""bibr"">2021</xref>). Importantly, the reverse is also true. ALS with concomitant pathologies (e.g., neurofibrillary tangles) appear overrepresented in ALSci cohorts, warranting further investigation into TDP‐43 interdependent pathways as well as potential converging and synergistic pathways of cognitive dysfunction (Strong, Donison, and Volkening <xref rid=""brb370115-bib-0122"" ref-type=""bibr"">2020</xref>; Borrego‐Écija et al. <xref rid=""brb370115-bib-0018"" ref-type=""bibr"">2021</xref>). Beyond TDP‐43, neurofilament (NF) levels are considered a non‐specific marker of neuroaxonal pathology, and NF levels as measured in cerebrospinal fluid or blood are, on average, higher in ALS cases than in most other neurological conditions (Rosengren et al. <xref rid=""brb370115-bib-0113"" ref-type=""bibr"">1996</xref>; Olsson et al. <xref rid=""brb370115-bib-0099"" ref-type=""bibr"">2019</xref>). NF levels are most consistently linked to the overall rate of neurological disease progression and survival, which is consistent with lower levels being observed in ‘pure’ FTD cases compared to ‘pure’ ALS cases (Lu et al. <xref rid=""brb370115-bib-0078"" ref-type=""bibr"">2015</xref>; Gaiani et al. <xref rid=""brb370115-bib-0057"" ref-type=""bibr"">2017</xref>; Olsson et al. <xref rid=""brb370115-bib-0099"" ref-type=""bibr"">2019</xref>). Given that cognitive impairment is an adverse prognostic factor in ALS, it would be intuitive to expect higher NF levels in such patients. This appears to be the case in several other neurodegenerative diseases, such as Parkinson's disease, and dementias, including FTD (Aamodt et al. <xref rid=""brb370115-bib-0001"" ref-type=""bibr"">2021</xref>; Silva‐Spínola et al. <xref rid=""brb370115-bib-0119"" ref-type=""bibr"">2022</xref>; Lehmann et al. <xref rid=""brb370115-bib-0075"" ref-type=""bibr"">2023</xref>). However, this has not been routinely observed in ALS (e.g., Gaiani et al. <xref rid=""brb370115-bib-0057"" ref-type=""bibr"">2017</xref>; Feneberg et al. <xref rid=""brb370115-bib-0053"" ref-type=""bibr"">2018</xref>), although one study found significantly elevated plasma NF light chain levels in the ALS–FTD cohort compared to ‘pure’ ALS or FTD groups (Vacchiano et al. <xref rid=""brb370115-bib-0131"" ref-type=""bibr"">2021</xref>). Up to 20% of ALS cases are linked to dominantly inherited pathological variants (Al‐Chalabi, van den Berg, and Veldink <xref rid=""brb370115-bib-0008"" ref-type=""bibr"">2017</xref>). The most common in North American and European populations is an intronic hexanucleotide repeat expansion (HRE) within <italic toggle=""yes"">C9orf72</italic> (Dejesus‐Hernandez et al. <xref rid=""brb370115-bib-0045"" ref-type=""bibr"">2011</xref>; Renton et al. <xref rid=""brb370115-bib-0112"" ref-type=""bibr"">2011</xref>). This accounts for approximately 40% and 25% of familial cases of ALS and FTLD, respectively (Majounie et al. <xref rid=""brb370115-bib-0081"" ref-type=""bibr"">2012</xref>). <italic toggle=""yes"">C9orf72</italic>‐related ALS (C9‐ALS) is associated with an earlier age of symptom onset, including both cognitive and behavioral manifestations, in particular significant deficits in language, executive functioning, and behavioral inhibition compared to non‐C9 cases (Byrne et al. <xref rid=""brb370115-bib-0025"" ref-type=""bibr"">2012</xref>; Irwin et al. <xref rid=""brb370115-bib-0067"" ref-type=""bibr"">2013</xref>). Whether this represents a unique endophenotype of C9‐ALS remains uncertain. One study found similar neuropsychological deficits, particularly poorer performance on letter fluency among non‐C9 relatives of familial ALS cases, suggesting that these cognitive traits may reflect a broader endophenotype associated with ALS risk rather than being exclusive to the <italic toggle=""yes"">C9orf72</italic> repeat expansion (Costello et al. <xref rid=""brb370115-bib-0040"" ref-type=""bibr"">2023</xref>). Another study identified an inverse correlation between HRE size and degree of cognitive impairment (Colombo et al. <xref rid=""brb370115-bib-0035"" ref-type=""bibr"">2023</xref>), but this remains unverified. Comparative structural imaging studies have also confirmed a congruent pattern of extramotor cortical and subcortical (particularly thalamic) involvement consistent with their neuropsychological profile (Bede et al. <xref rid=""brb370115-bib-0010"" ref-type=""bibr"">2013</xref>). Although a major predictor of cognitive and behavioral dysfunction in ALS, the typical cognitive profile and progression of C9‐ALS may not necessarily reflect the clinical course of sporadic ALSci. A recent, large longitudinal study (<italic toggle=""yes"">n</italic> = 237) found C9‐ALS individuals were more likely to experience progressive cognitive decline than non‐carriers, for example, (Mchutchison et al. <xref rid=""brb370115-bib-0085"" ref-type=""bibr"">2024</xref>). However, it is worth noting that in this study, not everyone with progressive cognitive decline were C9‐ALS individuals, suggesting that other factors are also responsible for this pattern of change. Some studies have even suggested neuropsychological and psychiatric manifestations (e.g., Snowden et al. <xref rid=""brb370115-bib-0120"" ref-type=""bibr"">2012</xref>; Costello et al. <xref rid=""brb370115-bib-0040"" ref-type=""bibr"">2023</xref>) may precede classical motor symptoms and be an initial presentation of C9‐ALS disease, but this remains unproven (Mioshi et al. <xref rid=""brb370115-bib-0089"" ref-type=""bibr"">2014</xref>; Lulé et al. <xref rid=""brb370115-bib-0079"" ref-type=""bibr"">2020</xref>). Among other genes associated with both ALS and FTD, <italic toggle=""yes"">TBK1</italic> is the next most common. Familial ALS, FTD, and ALS–FTD patients with TBK1 pathological variants often exhibit a behavioral phenotype characterized by symptoms, such as behavioral disinhibition, apathy, and emotional lability (Van Mossevelde et al. <xref rid=""brb370115-bib-0133"" ref-type=""bibr"">2016</xref>; Mccombe et al. <xref rid=""brb370115-bib-0084"" ref-type=""bibr"">2019</xref>). Following <italic toggle=""yes"">TBK1</italic>, pathological variants in <italic toggle=""yes"">TARDBP</italic> (encoding TDP‐43) and <italic toggle=""yes"">VCP</italic> are comparatively rare. About one‐third of ALS patients with pathological variants in <italic toggle=""yes"">TARDBP</italic> present with ALSci/ALSbi or ALScbi, generally lacking distinctive cognitive or behavioral impairment compared to sporadic ALS (Moglia et al. <xref rid=""brb370115-bib-0091"" ref-type=""bibr"">2024</xref>). Conversely, less is clear about <italic toggle=""yes"">VCP</italic>‐associated ALS, but a review of published cases indicated the predominant phenotype to be ‘classical ALS’ with cognitive or behavioral symptoms reported infrequently (Feng et al. <xref rid=""brb370115-bib-0054"" ref-type=""bibr"">2022</xref>). The second most common genetic variants associated with North American and European ALS cases are found in <italic toggle=""yes"">SOD1</italic>, accounting for 20% of familial cases and 2% overall. Such cases notably lack TDP‐43 pathology (Mackenzie et al.<xref rid=""brb370115-bib-0147"" ref-type=""bibr"">2007</xref>). Although initial studies suggested the absence of cognitive or behavioral impairment in <italic toggle=""yes"">SOD1</italic>‐related ALS (e.g., Wicks et al. <xref rid=""brb370115-bib-0136"" ref-type=""bibr"">2009</xref>), more recent research has challenged this. When compared to non‐carriers, <italic toggle=""yes"">SOD1</italic>+ pathological variant carriers have been shown to have significantly poorer performance on measures of executive functioning (Marjanović et al. <xref rid=""brb370115-bib-0082"" ref-type=""bibr"">2017</xref>), social cognition, and language (Chio et al. <xref rid=""brb370115-bib-0033"" ref-type=""bibr"">2024</xref>), as well as higher rates of behavioral impairment (Dalla Bella et al. <xref rid=""brb370115-bib-0044"" ref-type=""bibr"">2022</xref>). Different <italic toggle=""yes"">SOD1</italic> ALS genotypes may even exhibit distinct cognitive profiles. A recent study reported that although homozygous carriers of the D91A <italic toggle=""yes"">SOD1</italic> variant showed deficits in some cognitive tasks, particularly those assessing working memory, they significantly outperformed carriers of other <italic toggle=""yes"">SOD1</italic> mutations and sporadic ALS patients in tasks measuring cognitive processing speed (e.g., Digit Symbol Test) and cognitive flexibility (e.g., Stroop Test), with performance comparable to healthy controls (Winroth et al. <xref rid=""brb370115-bib-0139"" ref-type=""bibr"">2024</xref>). Behavioral symptoms meeting the criteria for ALSbi were reported in 50% of <italic toggle=""yes"">SOD1</italic> variant carriers and included more symptoms of mental rigidity and irritability (Dalla Bella et al. <xref rid=""brb370115-bib-0044"" ref-type=""bibr"">2022</xref>). Furthermore, behavioral impairment appeared to be specific to those with variants in Exon 5. Rare cases of ALS linked to variants in <italic toggle=""yes"">FUS</italic> gene also lack TDP‐43 pathology yet may be associated with FTD (Neumann et al. <xref rid=""brb370115-bib-0094"" ref-type=""bibr"">2009</xref>). Additionally, future genome‐wide association studies incorporating large, multi‐center cohorts of apparently sporadic ALSci, ALSbi, and ALScn may propose novel gene variants that confer a heightened risk of developing cognitive and behavioral impairment. Indeed, polymorphisms in <italic toggle=""yes"">UNC13A</italic> (rs12608932) and <italic toggle=""yes"">TMEM106B</italic> (rs1990622) have both been associated with cognitive impairment in ALS in some (Vass et al. <xref rid=""brb370115-bib-0134"" ref-type=""bibr"">2011</xref>; Tan et al. <xref rid=""brb370115-bib-0126"" ref-type=""bibr"">2020</xref>; Willemse et al. <xref rid=""brb370115-bib-0137"" ref-type=""bibr"">2023</xref>), but not all (Mchutchison et al. <xref rid=""brb370115-bib-0085"" ref-type=""bibr"">2024</xref>) studies, as have <italic toggle=""yes"">SOD1</italic> variants in Exon 5 (Dalla Bella et al. <xref rid=""brb370115-bib-0044"" ref-type=""bibr"">2022</xref>). Histopathological findings associated with a particular disease process offer important clues as to the etiological basis of that disease. However, in‐life neuroimaging is crucial to identify neuroanatomical correlates of clinical symptoms with potential biomarker utility. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and positron emission tomography (PET) studies provide evidence for structural, functional, and metabolic tissue changes associated with cognitive dysfunction in ALS. Structural MRI studies in ALS–FTD have detected regional gray matter loss in brain areas with roles in higher neurological functioning, including frontotemporal, cortical, and subcortical (e.g., caudate nucleus) areas, as well as more cortical thinning in more classical regions such as the dorsal motor cortex (Masuda et al. <xref rid=""brb370115-bib-0083"" ref-type=""bibr"">2016</xref>; De Marchi et al. <xref rid=""brb370115-bib-0046"" ref-type=""bibr"">2021</xref>). Within ALSci, cortical thinning is more pronounced in frontal, temporal, cingulate, and insular regions supporting the notion of a cognitive impairment–associated cortical atrophy profile for ALSci individuals, albeit with moderate inter‐individual variation (Schuster et al. <xref rid=""brb370115-bib-0118"" ref-type=""bibr"">2014</xref>; Agosta et al. <xref rid=""brb370115-bib-0007"" ref-type=""bibr"">2016</xref>; Consonni et al. <xref rid=""brb370115-bib-0036"" ref-type=""bibr"">2019</xref>; Consonni et al. <xref rid=""brb370115-bib-0038"" ref-type=""bibr"">2020</xref>). Notably though, extramotor cortical thinning is also present in ALScn cases limiting its specificity (Benbrika et al. <xref rid=""brb370115-bib-0013"" ref-type=""bibr"">2021</xref>). Consistent with the aforementioned evidence for ALSci typically exhibiting more advanced pathological staging, motor cortex atrophy in cognitively impaired individuals is often more severe (Mioshi et al. <xref rid=""brb370115-bib-0090"" ref-type=""bibr"">2013</xref>; Omer et al. <xref rid=""brb370115-bib-0100"" ref-type=""bibr"">2017</xref>). Neuroanatomically relevant patterns have also been observed for white matter loss as indicated by reduced fractional anisotropy (diffuse‐tensor imaging) in ALSci within tracts important for cognition and behavior, including the corpus callosum, superior longitudinal fasciculus, cingulum, and orbitofrontal gyrus (Evans et al. <xref rid=""brb370115-bib-0052"" ref-type=""bibr"">2015</xref>; Masuda et al. <xref rid=""brb370115-bib-0083"" ref-type=""bibr"">2016</xref>; Cheng et al. <xref rid=""brb370115-bib-0032"" ref-type=""bibr"">2020</xref>). Finally, several fluorodeoxyglucose–PET studies have demonstrated moderate frontal and temporal hypometabolism in FTSD–ALS cases on a continuum with more severe hypometabolism in frank FTLD–ALS cases, in contrast to little or no changes in ALScn (Canosa et al. <xref rid=""brb370115-bib-0030"" ref-type=""bibr"">2016</xref>; Hinault et al. <xref rid=""brb370115-bib-0065"" ref-type=""bibr"">2022</xref>). These results are consistent with a recent functional MRI study, which identified decreased functional connectivity in frontotemporal areas comparing ALSci and ALS–FTD within an ALScn cohort (Temp et al. <xref rid=""brb370115-bib-0127"" ref-type=""bibr"">2022</xref>). A smaller number of structural and functional brain imaging studies have also been instrumental in identifying key cortical regions and tracts associated with behavioral impairment. Importantly, and as mentioned previously, neuroanatomical correlates of apathy that involve several fronto‐subcortical regions appear to substantially overlap with those also implicated in verbal fluency dysfunction (Woolley et al. <xref rid=""brb370115-bib-0142"" ref-type=""bibr"">2011</xref>; Agosta et al. <xref rid=""brb370115-bib-0007"" ref-type=""bibr"">2016</xref>; Femiano et al. <xref rid=""brb370115-bib-0051"" ref-type=""bibr"">2018</xref>). Similarly, research into the neuroanatomical correlates of disinhibition has identified atrophy in the temporal and cingulate regions of the right hemisphere, as well as the right superior frontal gyrus (Consonni et al. <xref rid=""brb370115-bib-0036"" ref-type=""bibr"">2019</xref>). Compared to our understanding of cognitive dysfunction in ALS, less is known about other behavioral symptoms and their overlap with cognition in ALS highlighting the need for further research in this area. Although many clinical studies consistently affirm an association between cognitive dysfunction and specific factors such as bulbar involvement, advanced disease and faster rates of disability progression, longitudinal studies have been frequently confounded by selection bias and inappropriate testing platforms with inconsistent conclusions. Robust longitudinal studies focusing on monitoring behavioral dysfunction in ALS are scarce. Clinical correlation and neuroimaging analyses suggest that the most commonly reported cognitive deficit, verbal fluency, is highly associated with the most commonly reported behavioral change, apathy. Cognitive impairment has been linked to the presence of extramotor TDP‐43 deposits in clinico‐anatomically relevant areas. This is substantiated by neuroimaging studies identifying frontotemporal patterns of structural and metabolic deficiencies in cognitively impaired cases. Next steps will need to focus on elucidating important TDP‐43 disease pathways driving these phenotypic consequences. From a genetic perspective, C9‐ALS cohorts represents a leading resource for understanding the pre‐motor cognitive and behavioral landscape through partnership with asymptomatic carrier individuals. A framework for how this might be achieved is outlined (Figure <xref rid=""brb370115-fig-0001"" ref-type=""fig"">1</xref>).

Different intensities of physical activity for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and Parkinson disease: A Mendelian randomization study and meta-analysis,,"Neurodegenerative disorders, such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and Parkinson disease (PD), are a significant and increasing public health concern due to their progressive characteristics and impact on motor and cognitive functions.<sup>[<xref rid=""R1"" ref-type=""bibr"">1</xref>]</sup> ALS is characterized by the degeneration of motor neurons, leading to muscle weakness and paralysis,<sup>[<xref rid=""R2"" ref-type=""bibr"">2</xref>]</sup> while PD is marked by the loss of dopaminergic neurons, resulting in motor symptoms like tremors and rigidity, as well as non-motor issues.<sup>[<xref rid=""R3"" ref-type=""bibr"">3</xref>]</sup> The prevalence of ALS and PD are on the rise, largely due to the aging population, imposing substantial burdens on individuals and healthcare systems.<sup>[<xref rid=""R4"" ref-type=""bibr"">4</xref>]</sup> Despite the differences in their clinical manifestations, ALS and PD share common pathological mechanisms, including neuronal loss and protein misfolding, which has prompted research into modifiable risk factors, such as physical activity (PA), that may influence their progression (Fig. <xref rid=""F1"" ref-type=""fig"">1</xref>).<sup>[<xref rid=""R5"" ref-type=""bibr"">5</xref>]</sup> The relationships between PA and neurodegenerative disorders are complex and have been the subject of numerous studies, yielding inconsistent results. While some researches suggested a protective effect of PA on these conditions, other studies indicated no association or even a potential risk increase.<sup>[<xref rid=""R6"" ref-type=""bibr"">6</xref>,<xref rid=""R7"" ref-type=""bibr"">7</xref>]</sup> This variability may stem from the multifaceted characteristics of PA, which encompasses a broad spectrum of PA with different intensities, durations, and frequencies, as well as the influence of confounding factors such as genetics, lifestyle, and environmental exposures. To address these complexities, Mendelian randomization (MR) is a statistical method used to discern causal relationships between exposure factors and outcomes.<sup>[<xref rid=""R8"" ref-type=""bibr"">8</xref>]</sup> Its principle follows the Mendel law of inheritance, which states that genetic variation is distributed randomly during meiosis.<sup>[<xref rid=""R9"" ref-type=""bibr"">9</xref>]</sup> MR utilizes genetic variants associated with exposure factors (e.g., PA susceptibility), such as single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), to explore causal relationships with outcome variables.<sup>[<xref rid=""R10"" ref-type=""bibr"">10</xref>]</sup> The methodology of MR effectively addresses confounding issues by virtue of the random allocation of genetic alleles during the transmission from parents to offspring.<sup>[<xref rid=""R11"" ref-type=""bibr"">11</xref>]</sup> Consequently, these alleles are typically independent of other risk factors. Moreover, since genes are invariant during the progression of disease, MR studies can avoid inverse causality bias. In recent years, the possible causal relationships between the incidence of ALS, PD, and PA have been explored utilizing MR method.<sup>[<xref rid=""R12"" ref-type=""bibr"">12</xref>–<xref rid=""R16"" ref-type=""bibr"">16</xref>]</sup> We systematically reviewed published studies of MR with the aim of comprehensively evaluating and integrating the evidence regarding the causal association between ALS, PD, and different intensities of PA. To analyze de novo MR, we pooled statistics from the Finnish Genome Study (FinnGen) and other publicly accessible genome-wide association studies (GWAS) datasets. Subsequently, in order to provide new insights for PA intervention in neurodegenerative disorders, published studies and de novo MR analyses were pooled utilizing a meta-analysis approach.   Our study used a MR approach coupled with meta-analytic techniques to indicate the complex relationships between different intensities of PA and the risk of neurodegenerative disorders, with a specific focus on ALS and PD. Our findings, which reported a potential increase in ALS risk associated with MVPA, VPA, and SSOE, contrast with the traditional view that PA is universally protective against neurodegenerative disorders.<sup>[<xref rid=""R5"" ref-type=""bibr"">5</xref>,<xref rid=""R22"" ref-type=""bibr"">22</xref>,<xref rid=""R23"" ref-type=""bibr"">23</xref>]</sup> However, the lack of a significant association between PA and PD risk. These differences require a deeper exploration of the underlying mechanisms and a reevaluation of the current recommendations for PA in the background of neurodegenerative disorders. Previous researches have reported that PA may worsen the progression of ALS, which is consistent with our findings. In our work, we utilized MR to genetically investigate the impact of MVPA, VPA, and SSOE on the risk of ALS. We found that MVPA, VPA, and SSOE increased the risk of ALS, with the underlying biological mechanism potentially being that high-intensity PA lead to elevated oxidative stress, exacerbating the characteristic motor neuron degeneration in ALS and reducing synaptic plasticity, thereby slowing down neuroprotective and reparative mechanisms.<sup>[<xref rid=""R6"" ref-type=""bibr"">6</xref>,<xref rid=""R24"" ref-type=""bibr"">24</xref>–<xref rid=""R26"" ref-type=""bibr"">26</xref>]</sup> Additionally, the increased metabolic demands of motor neurons during PA may accelerate the pathological processes in genetically susceptible individuals.<sup>[<xref rid=""R27"" ref-type=""bibr"">27</xref>]</sup> Despite support from these hypotheses and theories, there is currently a lack of sufficient scientific research to clearly indicate the biological mechanisms by which PA intervenes in ALS. The impact of PA on ALS and its potential therapeutic effects need further investigation. The lack of a significant association between PA and PD risk in our study. It suggested that the relationship between PA and PD may be more complex and potentially moderated by factors such as disease stage, genetic predisposition, and the specific motor and non-motor symptoms experienced by individuals with PD.<sup>[<xref rid=""R28"" ref-type=""bibr"">28</xref>–<xref rid=""R31"" ref-type=""bibr"">31</xref>]</sup> Furthermore, it is possible that the neuroprotective effects of PA in PD are more pronounced in later stages of the disease, where the pathological processes are more advanced, and the benefits of PA might be more obvious.<sup>[<xref rid=""R32"" ref-type=""bibr"">32</xref>–<xref rid=""R34"" ref-type=""bibr"">34</xref>]</sup> The biological mechanisms through which different intensities of PA may influence the risk of neurodegenerative disorders require further study. Future researches should explore the role of molecular pathways, such as inflammation, autophagy, and mitochondrial function, which may be differentially affected by varying levels of PA.<sup>[<xref rid=""R35"" ref-type=""bibr"">35</xref>,<xref rid=""R36"" ref-type=""bibr"">36</xref>]</sup> Moreover, the potential for gene–environment interactions, where genetic susceptibility modifies the effect of PA on disease risk, should be examined in future studies.<sup>[<xref rid=""R37"" ref-type=""bibr"">37</xref>,<xref rid=""R38"" ref-type=""bibr"">38</xref>]</sup> To our knowledge, this is the first MR study and meta-analysis that provides new insight into the causal associations between ALS, PD and different intensities of PA. One notable strength of our study is MR can exclude biases in observational studies, including confounding factors and inverse causality. This is achieved by using genetic variants as instrumental variables in place of interested exposure (e.g., exercise), which are usually relatively stable and not affected by other factors. However, MR analysis is based on 3 core assumptions. (I) SNPs are strongly associated with PA. The SNPs selected for this study were significantly associated with genetic susceptibility to PA and the instrumental strength met the criteria, defined as <italic toggle=""yes"">F</italic>-statistic > 10 (Table S2, Supplemental Digital Content, <ext-link http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink href=""http://links.lww.com/MD/N826"" ext-link-type=""uri"">http://links.lww.com/MD/N826</ext-link>); (II) SNPs are independent of confounders; (III) SNPs must only affect multiple diseases via PA. While it is impossible to completely exclude the potential influence of pleiotropy on the findings, most studies reported results using robust methods such as the MR-Egger and weighted median approaches, which are less susceptible to pleiotropic bias, and reliable findings were observed in these secondary analyses. It is of importance to interpret results from MR-Egger analyses with caution, as some estimates exhibited low to highly imprecise, as evidenced by wide 95% CIs. The possible competing risk of bias in this study, which could have affected some of the findings, was also present in the MR analyses of adverse exposures and late-onset disease. Advancing age at study enrollment usually causes an increase in this bias.<sup>[<xref rid=""R39"" ref-type=""bibr"">39</xref>]</sup> Selection bias may have a less influence on MR findings than other biases.<sup>[<xref rid=""R40"" ref-type=""bibr"">40</xref>]</sup> The findings of MR studies can be affected by selection bias if collisions between genetic variants and confounders related to the exposure–outcome relationship affect study inclusion.<sup>[<xref rid=""R40"" ref-type=""bibr"">40</xref>]</sup> Population stratification bias is another potential bias in MR studies. For this study, the majority of the included studies comprised of individuals of European ancestry exclusively, and genetic principal components adjusted for other remaining stratification bias. Finally, the possible overlap in sample size may also cause potential bias. Our findings also have implications for clinical practice and public health guidelines. The potential increase in ALS risk associated with MVPA, VPA, and SSOE suggested that a single solution to PA recommendations may not be appropriate for all individuals, particularly those with a genetic predisposition to neurodegenerative disorders. Therefore, a personalized PA program must be carried out, taking into account an individual’s disease stage and personal preferences, to optimize health outcomes. In summary, we are pleased to demonstrate through the integration of extensive genetic evidence that MVPA, VPA, and SSOE can lead to an increased risk of ALS, without causal relationship for PD. Therefore, the intensity of different intensities PA is crucial for the progression of ALS, PD, and the rational and appropriate prescription of PA is an essential component of positive health promotion in public health. In the future, we may explore the specific mechanisms by which PA affects ALS and PD, including metabolic and inflammatory pathways, thereby providing new insights for disease prevention and treatment. <bold>Conceptualization:</bold> Shengbing Wu, Meiqi Zhou. <bold>Data curation:</bold> Wenyuan Xu, Xianghu Zhao, Jiaying Wang, Zhihao Ren. <bold>Formal analysis:</bold> Xianghu Zhao. <bold>Methodology:</bold> Xianghu Zhao, Yujie Guo, Zhihao Ren, Lian Cai. <bold>Software:</bold> Wenyuan Xu, Xianghu Zhao, Yujie Guo. <bold>Writing – original draft:</bold> Wenyuan Xu. <bold>Writing – review & editing:</bold> Wenyuan Xu.

DO NOT LOSE SLEEP OVER IT: IMPLANTED BRAIN-COMPUTER INTERFACE FUNCTIONALITY DURING NIGHTTIME IN LATE-STAGE AMYOTROPHIC LATERAL SCLEROSIS,,"Neural disease or injury can lead to a state of almost complete paralysis while cognition is spared, so called locked-in syndrome (<italic toggle=""yes"">LIS</italic>; <xref rid=""R3"" ref-type=""bibr"">American Congress of Rehabilitation Medicine, 1995</xref>; <xref rid=""R24"" ref-type=""bibr"">Smith & Delargy, 2005</xref>).

Conventional augmentative and alternative communication (<italic toggle=""yes"">AAC</italic>) technology can assist people with LIS in communication but requires residual, reliable motor control (<xref rid=""R8"" ref-type=""bibr"">Higginbotham et al., 2007</xref>), which not all people with LIS are able to produce.

Several studies have shown that people with severe paralysis can use an implanted BCI for communication (<xref rid=""R9"" ref-type=""bibr"">Hochberg et al., 2006</xref>; <xref rid=""R14"" ref-type=""bibr"">Metzger et al., 2023</xref>, <xref rid=""R15"" ref-type=""bibr"">2022</xref>; <xref rid=""R16"" ref-type=""bibr"">Mitchell et al., 2023</xref>; <xref rid=""R17"" ref-type=""bibr"">Moses et al., 2021</xref>; <xref rid=""R19"" ref-type=""bibr"">Oxley et al., 2021</xref>; <xref rid=""R20"" ref-type=""bibr"">Pandarinath et al., 2017</xref>; <xref rid=""R25"" ref-type=""bibr"">Stavisky et al., 2018</xref>; <xref rid=""R28"" ref-type=""bibr"">Vansteensel et al., 2016</xref>; <xref rid=""R30"" ref-type=""bibr"">Willett et al., 2023</xref>, <xref rid=""R29"" ref-type=""bibr"">2021</xref>). Moreover, first evidence of the feasibility and user benefit of unsupervised at-home use of implanted BCI systems has now been demonstrated (<xref rid=""R19"" ref-type=""bibr"">Oxley et al., 2021</xref>; <xref rid=""R28"" ref-type=""bibr"">Vansteensel et al., 2016</xref>; <xref rid=""R27"" ref-type=""bibr"">Vansteensel et al., 2024</xref>). Successful at-home use of a communication device by people with LIS, however, involves the ability to call caregivers and communicate needs not just during the day, but also at night. Importantly, research has shown that sleep affects brain activity in several regions (<xref rid=""R2"" ref-type=""bibr"">Achermann, 2009</xref>; <xref rid=""R26"" ref-type=""bibr"">Šušmáková, 2004</xref>), including the sensorimotor cortex (<xref rid=""R7"" ref-type=""bibr"">De Carli et al., 2016</xref>; <xref rid=""R21"" ref-type=""bibr"">Ramot et al., 2013</xref>), which constitutes the signal source of the vast majority of implanted BCIs. We here used a unique dataset from a BCI user with late-stage amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) to investigate how BCI control signals in the sensorimotor cortex change at night. Second, we tested the nocturnal performance of BCI decoders that were optimized for daytime usage by applying them, offline, to night data. Finally, we developed and tested a dedicated nightmode decoding algorithm that allowed the BCI user to reliably generate a call-caregiver signal at night and assessed its performance in daily life settings over a period of ± 1.5 years.   For real-life use, a BCI communication device should be available and function reliably 24/7. We show, in a person with late-stage ALS who had an implanted BCI system, that decoders that performed well during daytime generated high rates of false positive detections of BCI actions during sleep, related to different nocturnal signal characteristics, which in effect would render the system useless at night if not accounted for. We also present a nightmode decoder solution that allowed the user to activate the BCI system and call caregivers reliably at night, with few false positive activations. We report on day-night differences in ECoG signals measured in an implanted BCI user with late-stage ALS. We show that LFB and HFB sensorimotor signals used for BCI control were subject to spontaneous signal perturbations during the night, and that applying BCI decoder parameters optimized for daytime use to night data caused many unintended decoder activations. We present for the first time a nightmode decoder solution that allowed a BCI user to reliably call a caregiver at night. Providing a BCI system that can cope with sleep-related brain signal changes is the difference between a BCI system that is available 24/7 and a BCI system that is usable 24/7. ",N/A,15 10 2024
Health care resource utilization and costs across stages of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis in the United States," Living with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) in the United States can be costly. This includes the cost of medical and nonmedical care. Using insurance coverage and disease stage, we show that the use of health care resources and costs increases with how bad ALS gets. Finding out early if someone has ALS and treating them as soon as possible may reduce these costs by keeping them at a stage that uses fewer resources. Our findings show that health care resource utilization and costs increase with disease progression in people with ALS, highlighting the importance of comprehensive access to therapies that may slow the ALS disease course. Improvements to reduce the time to diagnosis and the time to genetic testing would facilitate people with ALS receiving therapies earlier in the disease course and could potentially delay progression into a more resource-intensive stage.",Full text not available in PMC,N/A,11 2024
Investigating the impact of socioeconomic status on amyotrophic lateral sclerosis,"Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a neurodegenerative disease characterized by the gradual death of motor neurons in the brain and spinal cord, leading to fatal paralysis. Socioeconomic status (SES) is a measure of an individual’s shared economic and social status, which has been shown to have an association with health outcomes. Understanding the impact of SES on health conditions is crucial, as it can influence and be influenced by health-related variables. The role of socioeconomic status in influencing the risk and progression of ALS has not been established, and understanding the various factors that impact ALS is important in developing strategies for treatment and prevention. To investigate this relationship, we recruited 413 participants with definite, probable, or possible ALS according to the El Escorial criteria, from three tertiary centers in London, Sheffield, and Birmingham. Logistic regression was used to examine the association between case-control status, socioeconomic criteria, and ALS risk. Linear regression was used to examine the association between age of onset and socioeconomic variables. Two sensitivity analyses were performed, one using an alternative occupational classifier, and the other using Mendelian Randomization analysis to examine association. There was no significant relationship between any variables and ALS risk. We found an inverse relationship between mean lifetime salary and age of ALS onset (Beta = −0.157, <italic toggle=""yes"">p</italic> = 0.011), but no effect of education or occupation on the age of onset. The finding was confirmed in both sensitivity analyses and in Mendelian Randomization. We find that a higher salary is associated with a younger age of ALS onset taking into account sex, occupation, years of education, and clinical presentation.","Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a genetically complex neurodegenerative disease of mid-life, which results in the progressive loss of motor neurons that control voluntary muscles, with death occurring on average two years from the first symptoms (<xref rid=""CIT0001"" ref-type=""bibr"">1</xref>). Socioeconomic status is defined as a measure of one’s shared economic and social status and tends to be positively associated with better health (<xref rid=""CIT0002"" ref-type=""bibr"">2</xref>). Since environmental exposure is considered a modifiable risk factor for ALS, and socioeconomic status and environmental exposure are strongly correlated, socioeconomic factors are likely to contribute to ALS risk. We therefore sought to test the hypothesis that socioeconomic factors are risk factors for ALS. There are three common measures of socioeconomic status: education, income, and occupation (<xref rid=""CIT0003"" ref-type=""bibr"">3</xref>). Socioeconomic status has an established effect on the incidence and prevalence of many diseases. For example, socioeconomic status is associated with increased cardiovascular disease risk in men and women (<xref rid=""CIT0004"" ref-type=""bibr"">4</xref>) as well as with many types of cancer, and respiratory diseases (<xref rid=""CIT0005"" ref-type=""bibr"">5</xref>). Moreover, Mendelian Randomization has demonstrated a relationship between better educational attainment as a socioeconomic factor and a lower risk of Alzheimer’s disease (<xref rid=""CIT0006"" ref-type=""bibr"">6</xref>). One study has suggested that greater educational attainment is associated with increased ALS risk (<xref rid=""CIT0007"" ref-type=""bibr"">7</xref>). This observation might indicate a relationship between socioeconomic status and ALS risk. Similarly, income has been explored as an ALS risk factor, but only as a proxy for other factors, not because it corresponds to socioeconomic status (<xref rid=""CIT0008"" ref-type=""bibr"">8</xref>). Occupational exposures have also been studied as potential ALS risk factors but in isolation as environmental risk factors rather than as indicators of socioeconomic status (<xref rid=""CIT0009"" ref-type=""bibr"">9</xref>). For example, military service has been found to increase the risk of ALS (<xref rid=""CIT0010"" ref-type=""bibr"">10</xref>) but this is assumed to be a result of environmental exposure resulting from deployment to a conflict zone rather than from any interaction with socioeconomic status. Since socioeconomic status is an established criterion influencing disease risk, we set out to explore the relationship between socioeconomic status, age of onset of ALS, and risk of ALS. Because there is a genetic component to socioeconomic status, it is possible to leverage such data to explore the relationship between socioeconomic status and ALS indirectly. We further sought to validate our findings using convergent evidence from genetic studies.  There were 413 participants who provided informed consent, and 405 of these undertook a telephone interview about their lifestyle. Of those, 284 were cases, and 121 were controls. There were 226 men and 179 women. The mean age of onset was 61.2 years. There were 76 people with bulbar onset ALS and 193 who had limb onset disease; eight presented with respiratory onset and seven patients with mixed onset. We found that a higher income category is independently associated with a younger age of onset of ALS but not with a higher risk compared with controls. The finding that income is related to age of ALS onset is unexpected, and we therefore attempted to corroborate our findings using Mendelian randomization. Typically, the Inverse Variance Weighted method is interpreted as the overall result, and in our case, it is exactly at the threshold for significance, with <italic toggle=""yes"">p</italic> = 0.05. The Weighted Median method is robust to poor instrumental variables that might otherwise affect the Inverse Variance Weighted method and supports a causal relationship between income and ALS risk, but the lack of a confirmed association using MR Egger suggests that horizontal pleiotropy may be the explanation, and that the apparently causal relationship is therefore spurious. Genetic variants do not directly determine income but have an indirect effect through their associations with traits like educational attainment, cognitive ability, personality, and health conditions. These traits can then impact socioeconomic status and income through various pathways. However, each genetic variant has a very small effect, and environmental and social factors play a much larger role in income variation across individuals and populations. Horizontal pleiotropy occurs when the variant has an effect on disease outside of its effect on the exposure in Mendelian randomization. In other words, the genetic variants that influence income also influence other factors that increase ALS risk. Nevertheless, the Mendelian randomization analysis provides convergent evidence for our finding since it shows an association, and it is unlikely that salary is a direct cause of younger onset of ALS, so the finding of possible horizontal pleiotropy is consistent with expectations. It might be expected that occupation influences the likelihood of ALS because occupation is a proxy for other risk factors. For example, an association has been previously reported between ALS risk and professional football. This has been variously attributed to the possibility of head injury, aerosol injection of pesticides during ball impact, and a predisposition to ALS in individuals engaging in sport because of a genetic component (<xref rid=""CIT0013"" ref-type=""bibr"">13</xref>). The causation of ALS may be the result of a multistep cascade (<xref rid=""CIT0014"" ref-type=""bibr"">14</xref>,<xref rid=""CIT0015"" ref-type=""bibr"">15</xref>). Occupational exposures might therefore be expected to impact ALS risk. Our finding of no association is therefore surprising but maybe because of the difficulty in classifying occupations in a meaningful way for such an analysis given that the mechanism of non-genetic (i.e. apparently sporadic) ALS is unknown. Without a clear understanding of how environmental or occupational factors contribute to ALS pathogenesis, it becomes difficult to group occupations in a way that accurately captures relevant exposures or risk factors. Our relatively small sample size also means that any heterogeneity in the classification of occupations will significantly reduce already reduced power. We have tried to overcome this problem by using two different algorithms for occupational classification. A great deal of previous research has investigated the impact of income on disease risk factors but on a population scale, for example, blood pressure risk for cardiac diseases has been examined in high- and low-income countries (<xref rid=""CIT0016"" ref-type=""bibr"">16–19</xref>). The impact of salary on the risk of diseases is the subject of fewer investigations but also includes examining the effect of income on disease progression or survival. In the case of kidney diseases, for instance, there is a consistent and positive correlation between higher income percentile and longer life expectancy (<xref rid=""CIT0020"" ref-type=""bibr"">20</xref>). Consistent with our findings on a small population level, a previous analysis examing the Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries and Risk Factors Study 2016 across 21 world regions (<xref rid=""CIT0021"" ref-type=""bibr"">21</xref>) found that in general, the incidence and prevalence of ALS is higher in countries with a higher sociodemographic index. Explanations considered included improved awareness, shorter time to diagnosis, and increased access to multidisciplinary care. Our findings are consistent with these reports since we show that a higher income is associated with a younger onset of ALS, not protection. This is seen sometimes in other conditions. For example, higher incomes are associated with an increased risk of anorexia nervosa (<xref rid=""CIT0022"" ref-type=""bibr"">22</xref>). Similarly, Down syndrome, which is associated with older age at conception in mothers, would also be expected to correlate with the higher income of an older person. Given that education is linked to a mother’s later age at conception, it is plausible that the relationship between income and the likelihood of Down syndrome is due to the impact of education on salary (<xref rid=""CIT0023"" ref-type=""bibr"">23</xref>). A limitation of this study is that the lifetime income would be expected to rise with increasing age, and therefore there is confounding between the predictor variable, income, and the dependent variable, age of ALS onset. However, this observation would be expected to result in an association of higher income with increasing age of onset, not what we found, and our analysis is therefore conservative concerning our findings. Also, the imbalanced nature of 284 cases <italic toggle=""yes"">vs.</italic> 121 controls means that bias is more likely. We have found that a higher mean lifetime salary is associated with a younger age of onset of ALS. To fully understand this link and the underlying causal mechanisms, more research is required.",N/A,1 9 2024
Predicting clinical events characterizing the progression of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis via machine learning approaches using routine visits data: a feasibility study,,"Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a rapidly progressive neurodegenerative disease that affects motor neurons in the brain and spinal cord, leading to muscle weakness, atrophy, and, ultimately, paralysis. The disease typically results in death within a relatively short span of 3-5 years, although survival times can vary widely and depend on many factors including age, site of onset, rate of disease progression, and presence of comorbidities [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR1"">1</xref>]. ALS is also characterized by significant heterogeneity in its progression across the patient population, with some individuals showing a slow progression and others experiencing a rapid decline [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR2"">2</xref>]. One of the major challenges in treating ALS is the lack of effective prognostic tools for predicting disease progression. Precise prognostic tools would facilitate improved drug development through more cost-effective and accurate clinical trials, while also offering valuable insights into disease progression. In recent years, artificial intelligence (AI) approaches have shown promise for predicting clinical outcomes in various disease contexts, including ALS [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR3"">3</xref>–<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR6"">6</xref>]. By leveraging complex algorithms and large amounts of data, AI-based models can identify patterns and relationships that may not be immediately apparent to human observers. In the case of ALS, this could potentially lead to more accurate prognostic tools that could help clinicians tailor treatment plans to individual patients. Several ALS clinical outcomes can be predicted via AI models, such as the evolution of ALS functional rating scale ALSFRS or its revised version ALSFRS-R [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR7"">7</xref>, <xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR8"">8</xref>], the forced vital capacity (FVC) value [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR9"">9</xref>], and the occurrence of relevant events related to disease progression, i.e., the need for non-invasive ventilation (NIV) [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR10"">10</xref>], tracheostomy [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR11"">11</xref>], or death [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR12"">12</xref>, <xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR13"">13</xref>]. Most literature studies approach the prediction problem using classification modeling techniques (e.g., random forests or logistic regression (LR)), few studies opt for survival analysis approaches such as the Cox model, and only a handful of studies employ deep-learning techniques. Overall, the literature concerning the development of predictive models for clinical outcomes of ALS is still limited as most studies focus on the identification of risk factors based on statistical analyses rather than providing a prediction model [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR14"">14</xref>]. Another relevant factor influencing the limited model development is the disease’s rarity [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR15"">15</xref>] which makes collecting enough high-quality data quite challenging. Hence, most studies approach the problem using small datasets obtained from specific clinical trials [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR16"">16</xref>]. These approaches achieve good predictive power, with an Area Under the Receiver-Operating Curve (AUROC) <inline-formula id=""IEq1""><alternatives><tex-math id=""M1"">\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}

However, as the considered variables are trial-specific and thus not necessarily collected during everyday clinical practice, their translation into real-world applications is not easily performed. In a previous study from our group [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR6"">6</xref>], the problem of predicting relevant clinical events for ALS was considered within a survival analysis framework. To follow up on our previous work and provide a complementary perspective, in this study, the objective was to explore the possibility of using AI-based approaches in a single and multiclass classification framework to predict relevant clinical outcomes that characterize the progression of ALS via readily available data collected during routine visits. Two types of AI models (LR and multilayer perceptron (MLP)) were developed and tested to predict three clinical outcomes of great interest to clinicians: death, percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG), and non-invasive ventilation (NIV) within two years from the first visit. A first binary classification problem was defined based on the event of death. A second three-class problem was defined distinguishing instances where no events occur within two years (class 0), instances where death occurs within 2 years and before PEG (class 1), and instances where PEG is performed within 2 years and before death (class 2). Finally, a third classification problem was defined similarly to the second one, but considering NIV instead of PEG as a clinical event of interest. Moreover, this feasibility analysis is completed by providing insights into model explainability. Specifically, the strength of the relation between each variable and the outcome was evaluated by considering the estimated model coefficients for LR and the SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) values [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR17"">17</xref>] for both LR and MLP. Results suggested that while the considered AI approaches had acceptable predictive performance for the binary classification task of predicting death within two years, combining the prediction of death with either PEG or NIV in a multiclass classification problem is more challenging considering the available data. Our study provides valuable insights into the potential and limitations of AI-based predictive models for ALS using input variables obtained from routine visits.   In this work, the data collected in two ALS registries (the Italian PARALS registry and the Lisbon ALS registry) were used to explore the feasibility of developing prognostic models of relevant clinical outcomes of ALS using data collected during routine visits. Specifically, three outcomes were considered in a single and multiclass fashion: namely death (binary outcome), death or PEG (multiclass outcome), and death or NIV (multiclass outcome). Two different modeling approaches were considered: a simple linear approach, i.e., LR, and a more complex non-linear approach, i.e., MLP. This work can be seen as an extension of [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR6"">6</xref>], where the same problem of predicting relevant clinical events for ALS was considered. However, in this previous work, the prediction was tackled using similar data but with a survival analysis perspective, whereas we are now considering a more challenging single and multiclass classification perspective. On the one hand, models developed to predict death as a binary classification task showed acceptable performance (AUROC <inline-formula id=""IEq7""><alternatives><tex-math id=""M13"">\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}

These results are in line with those obtained by participants in the intelligent disease progression prediction 2022 challenge (iDPP@CLEF 2022) [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR38"">38</xref>], which used similar data to those available for this study but framed the problem of predicting death in a survival fashion. On the other hand, predicting multiclass outcomes such as death alongside PEG or NIV proved to be more challenging with the available variables. As the model performance was comparable between the linear and the non-linear techniques, the main driver of predictive performance might be the information that can be extracted from the available data, which includes only variables recorded during routine visits performed at ALS centers. These data have a general nature as they are collected with the aim of giving a broad view of the patient’s disease status rather than performing its full characterization. Model performance could be improved by collecting variables that allow for an in-depth characterization of the disease, such as blood or cerebrospinal fluid tests [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR39"">39</xref>]. However, these measurements are more invasive and their collection process is much more lengthy and expensive. Hence, these data are often not readily available for large amounts of patients as they are typically collected only during clinical trials. This, paired with the fact that clinicians are still studying factors influencing ALS progression and thus many variables are still not known or not measured, is currently a strong limitation towards the development of better-performing predictive models of ALS progression. In conclusion, our study highlights the potential of AI approaches in complex tasks such as predicting the death of ALS patients using simple data collected during daily clinical practice. However, predicting the occurrence of PEG or NIV alongside death in a multiclass fashion proved to be unfeasible with these data, regardless of the complexity of the chosen methodological approach. Hence, in the future, further studies may focus on the collection or extraction of time-varying and outcome-specific variables as well as the development of more sophisticated methodologies able to consider better temporal information to improve the predictive performance of AI-based approaches.",N/A,29 10 2024
Overview of nomenclature and diagnosis of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis,"The nomenclature of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) currently is blurred, indistinct and no accurate and haven’t been properly updated since the first description, which is far from being suitable for the current implementation of clinical practise and scientific research of ALS, and urgently need an solution. Furthermore, the current diagnostic criteria need also further been improved, because the current clinical diagnosis of ALS majorly depends on the clinical manifestations yet. Up to now, no any objective clinical auxiliary examination can be helpful to diagnose ALS besides the electromyogram identifying the lower motor neuron damage, which isn’t conducive to early diagnosis and prolongs the time of ALS confirmed diagnosis. In this mini review, we discussed the current doubt about the nomenclature and diagnostic criteria of ALS, and prospected in order to further improve and normalize the nomenclature and diagnosis of ALS.","Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a rare neurodegenerative disease, usually classified into the familial and sporadic ALS clinically based on the genetic background. The current nomenclature of ALS is considered to be not accurate and proper based on the current results of clinical and experimental studies [<xref rid=""CIT0001"" ref-type=""bibr"">1</xref>,<xref rid=""CIT0002"" ref-type=""bibr"">2</xref>]. At present, there exists the different nomenclature in the different countries or/and regions according to their bias. For example, ALS and motor neuron diseases (MNDs) are usually considered as the same nomenclature or disease name on the course of clinical diagnosis and treatment in the countries of the United Kingdom. However, in the other countries and regions of no United Kingdom such as the United States, the partial European countries and China, MNDs are usually are categorized into four different subtypes including ALS, primary lateral sclerosis (PLS), progressive muscular atrophy (PMA) and progressive bulbar palsy (PBP), ALS is considered to be one common subtype of MNDs [<xref rid=""CIT0003"" ref-type=""bibr"">3–6</xref>]. In fact, more and more evidences demonstrate that MNDs are belong to a wide spectrum of disorders, ALS is the most common MNDs, while PLS, PMA, PBP are the most common clinical phenotypes of this heterogeneous disease. Other MNDs include spinobulbar muscular atrophy, infectious MNDs, spinal muscular atrophy, etc. The current nomenclature about ALS in the worldwide hasn’t reached a consensus yet. Therefore, the ambiguous nomenclature about ALS seriously affects and hinders the conduction of clinical diagnostic and treatment as well as various clinical investigations and trials. In addition, the current diagnostic criteria of ALS [<xref rid=""CIT0006"" ref-type=""bibr"">6</xref>,<xref rid=""CIT0007"" ref-type=""bibr"">7</xref>] also exist some deficiencies. Because the objective clinical auxiliary examination measures for diagnosing ALS currently are relatively insufficient, the newest revised diagnostic criteria [<xref rid=""CIT0006"" ref-type=""bibr"">6</xref>,<xref rid=""CIT0007"" ref-type=""bibr"">7</xref>] still conduct the clinical diagnosis mainly depended on the clinical manifestations. Among the current diagnostic criteria [<xref rid=""CIT0006"" ref-type=""bibr"">6</xref>,<xref rid=""CIT0007"" ref-type=""bibr"">7</xref>], besides the electromyogram can be used in defining the motor neurons damage in anterior horn of spinal cord, other auxiliary examinations such the routine magnetic resonance imaging of brain and spinal cord are only applied in the differential diagnosis of some ALS-mimicking diseases [<xref rid=""CIT0008"" ref-type=""bibr"">8</xref>]. Therefore, it is challenging to diagnose ALS, and is very difficult to catch the disease and conduct the confirmed diagnosis early on the course of ALS depending on the current diagnostic criteria [<xref rid=""CIT0006"" ref-type=""bibr"">6</xref>,<xref rid=""CIT0007"" ref-type=""bibr"">7</xref>], which delays the confirmed diagnostic time, prevents the early intervene of ALS, and isn’t benefit to conduct the clinical investigation on the pathogenesis, etiology and treatment of ALS at the early stage yet [<xref rid=""CIT0009"" ref-type=""bibr"">9</xref>,<xref rid=""CIT0010"" ref-type=""bibr"">10</xref>]. The main reasons bring the difficulty of early confirmed diagnosis are the heterogeneity of clinical phenotype of ALS, which need exclude lots of curable ALS-mimicking diseases at the early stage of ALS, thus need spend a lot of time to perform the extensive related clinical auxiliary examination including the laboratory test, genetics screening, neuroimaging, etc. because of lacking the confident diagnostic biomarkers at present [<xref rid=""CIT0011"" ref-type=""bibr"">11</xref>]. In view of the current situation about the nomenclature and diagnostic criteria of ALS [<xref rid=""CIT0008"" ref-type=""bibr"">8</xref>,<xref rid=""CIT0012"" ref-type=""bibr"">12</xref>], it is necessary to update them as soon as possible after being comprehensively discussed by the neurologists focusing on studying ALS. Especially in the nomenclature of ALS, they aren’t very suited to the clinical and investigating application of neurologists. It is urgently necessary to make an optimal nomenclature for this disease because the no accurate nomenclature will seriously hinder the progression of the clinical and investigating practice in this disease. To this end, this topic should be more thoroughly discussed. The goal of this mini review paper is to discuss the possible existed question about the current nomenclature and diagnosis of ALS [<xref rid=""CIT0002"" ref-type=""bibr"">2</xref>]. In our clinical and investigated practise, we found that the current nomenclature and diagnosis of ALS (<xref rid=""F0001"" ref-type=""fig"">Figure 1</xref>) exited some questions and doubts. This mini review aims to emphasis and further promote our idea in our previous published paper about ‘considerations on the concept, definition, and diagnosis of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis’ again [<xref rid=""CIT0002"" ref-type=""bibr"">2</xref>], make our thoughts receive more extensive attention from more neuroscientists and resolve the current issues about the nomenclature and diagnosis of ALS as soon as possible. We searched the current ALS nomenclature and diagnosis information on PubMed, EmBase, Google Scholar, WanFang, Cochrane Library websites and various medical guidelines using the key search terminology ‘amyotrophic lateral sclerosis’, ‘motor neuron disease’, ‘familial amyotrophic lateral sclerosis’, ‘sporadic amyotrophic lateral sclerosis’, ‘ALS’, ‘familial ALS’, ‘sporadic ALS’, in combination with ‘nomenclature’, and ‘diagnosis’ at the end of February 2024. In addition, we used the modifications of main keywords to thoroughly search the literature on the history, current nomenclature and diagnosis of ALS. We also analyzed the current problems related to these information based on the retrieved literature as well as the difficulties that we encountered in our clinical work. The literature review was performed with the strict control of information based on the assembled problems and the information from searching literature. The problems and proposals extracted from our literature review and clinical experiences are presented herein [<xref rid=""CIT0002"" ref-type=""bibr"">2</xref>]. These related articles were included the articles from the reference lists, the review articles, the major textbook chapters as well as the abstracts and reports from the relevant meetings. The final reference lists were generated on the basis of originality and relevance to the topics covered in this commentary. Emphasis was placed on publications from the past nearly 30 years, but didn’t exclude the commonly referenced and highly regarded older publications. ALS is a progression adult onset neurodegeneration disease, which mainly damages upper and lower motor neurons, partially also involves frontotemporal and other regions of brain. The extent to the different neuron cells is affected varies between individuals. The current phenotype classification of ALS are conducted based on the onset pattern, which results in confusion between nomenclature of ALS in the clinical work. The current nomenclature such as the international classification of diseases are the systematic approaches, while these approaches usually don’t consider some special characteristics in the clinical practice, such as progression, the genetic factors, the vast clinical variability of presentation and prognosis or the accurate pathological alterations. At present, the routine classification approach of disease might not be suitable for the nomenclature of ALS for neurologists, which will bring the difficult for their clinical and research work, such as the confused nomenclature, which leads the inaccurate diagnosis of ALS [<xref rid=""CIT0009"" ref-type=""bibr"">9</xref>]. Moreover, the classification and nomenclature of this disease, whether sporadic or familial, also is confused [1,<xref rid=""CIT0012"" ref-type=""bibr"">12</xref>]. A novel nomenclature being suitable for the complex and variable phenotype of ALS urgently need be setup in clinical practice. The characterized clinical symptoms and signs of ALS patients include the combined lesion of chronic progressive upper motor neuron (UMN) and lower motor neuron (LMN), and these clinical manifestations can’t be explained by any other diseases. Meanwhile, it is necessary to combine the related evidences on neuroelectrophysiological, imaging, genetics, cerebrospinal fluid or serological laboratory examination and the patient’s history, achieves an adequate clinical diagnosis on ALS. Although the diagnostic criteria were multiple times revised following by the deeply ALS researching, the diagnosis of ALS still mainly depends on the characteristic clinical manifestations and the evidences excluding ‘ALS-mimic’ syndromes [<xref rid=""CIT0008"" ref-type=""bibr"">8–10</xref>,<xref rid=""CIT0011"" ref-type=""bibr"">11</xref>] (<xref rid=""t0001"" ref-type=""table"">Table 1</xref>). For that, the current diagnostic criteria result in 5–10% diagnostic error ratio [<xref rid=""CIT0035"" ref-type=""bibr"">35</xref>,<xref rid=""CIT0036"" ref-type=""bibr"">36</xref>] and 10–16 months of diagnostic delay [<xref rid=""CIT0037"" ref-type=""bibr"">37–39</xref>]. The current nomenclature and diagnostic criteria of ALS still exists doubt, which brings some troubles and difficulties in the clinical study, diagnosis and early treatment of ALS. Therefore, I suggest that the nomenclature and diagnostic criteria of ALS should been comprehensively discussed and further revised. How to make the nomenclature of ALS and improve the early and accurate diagnosis of ALS is an important and urgent scientific task. In America, ALS usually is known as Lou Gerhrig’s disease because of a famous baseball player in American history, was diagnosed as ALS on June 21, 1939, ALS is named Lou Gerhrig’s disease in order to memory him [<xref rid=""CIT0049"" ref-type=""bibr"">49</xref>]. Therefore, whether or not could use Lou Gerhrig name to replace ALS. Such as Alzheimer’s disease and Parkinson’s disease, these diseases use the names of the medical scientists who first described or found this disease to name the disease in order to memory these famous persons. Of course, at the international unwritten traditional convention, the disease nomenclature often is named based on the name of scientist who firstly described or found this disease, or who provided some important contributions for this disease. Regarding to use the nomenclature of the famous not scientist name hasn’t been reported up to date to the best of my knowledge in the history of international medical nomenclature. Therefore, the nomenclature of ALS need be drafted and proposed the nomenclature of ALS after comprehensively discussing among neurologists, and the more accurate nomenclature about ALS need extensively discuss by neurologist to search a most appropriate word. In addition, how to improve the early and accurate diagnosis of ALS is a problem that should be solved quickly yet, which is the reason that no any effective treatment currently can use in the clinical prevent and cure ALS, is waiting for further exploring and investigating the effective prevention and/or cure of ALS based on the early and accurate diagnosis. Based on author’s research experiences, author suggest that it might be a promising and feasible method searching the effective diagnostic biomarkers through retrospectively surveying the ALS patients after the accurate diagnostic of ALS by performing extensive autopsy to improve the ALS diagnosis. Moreover, the heterogeneity of ALS is very various and complex [<xref rid=""CIT0050"" ref-type=""bibr"">50</xref>,<xref rid=""CIT0051"" ref-type=""bibr"">51</xref>], among them, the genetic heterogeneity is very obvious, a series of genes mutations have been found participated in the pathogenesis of ALS [<xref rid=""CIT0005"" ref-type=""bibr"">5</xref>]. Besides, the phenotypic, etiologic and mechanistic heterogeneities also are relatively complex and variable, which requires us to comprehensively consider the various aspects of ALS complex heterogeneities when proposing the most propriety namelature of ALS. Meanwhile, the diagnosis more should be like namelature to extensively consider the genetics, phenotypic, etiologic and mechanistic heterogeneities to formulate the accurate diagnostic criteria, couldn’t only simply depend on the clinical manifestations and onset location like the current diagnostic criteria [<xref rid=""CIT0008"" ref-type=""bibr"">8</xref>].",N/A,29 10 2024
Video Assessment to Detect Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis,,"Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a highly dilapidating motor neuron disease. It is characterized by progressive muscle weakness and the inability to perform voluntary muscle contractions which impacts on many essential functions such as chewing, walking, talking, and facial expressions. Early symptoms of ALS include reduced facial expressiveness [<xref rid=""B1"" ref-type=""bibr"">1</xref>, <xref rid=""B2"" ref-type=""bibr"">2</xref>]. However, with large differences in facial expressions between individuals, recognizing these changes, especially in the early stages, can be subjective with potential misdiagnosis [<xref rid=""B3"" ref-type=""bibr"">3</xref>–<xref rid=""B5"" ref-type=""bibr"">5</xref>]. Thus, there is an opportunity for computerized analysis of facial expressions to improve the reliability in the diagnosis of ALS. Computerized identification of facial expressions has been proposed for a number of applications, such as biometrics, emotion recognition, and neurological identification [<xref rid=""B6"" ref-type=""bibr"">6</xref>–<xref rid=""B10"" ref-type=""bibr"">10</xref>]. While different approaches have been proposed, recognizing facial expressions using the Facial Action Coding System [<xref rid=""B11"" ref-type=""bibr"">11</xref>] has the advantage because it provides a physical description of the feature in terms of the facial expression. This is a systematic approach that analyzes facial actions based on a set of 46 individual actions, namely, action units (AUs), each corresponding to specific facial muscle movement. The method has been widely used, improved, and adapted for number of applications [<xref rid=""B12"" ref-type=""bibr"">12</xref>]. Hamm et al. [<xref rid=""B13"" ref-type=""bibr"">13</xref>] estimated using the Facial Action Coding System from temporal AU profiles for emotion analysis. Lucey et al. [<xref rid=""B14"" ref-type=""bibr"">14</xref>] described a method to detect pain in video through facial AUs. Barrios et al. [<xref rid=""B15"" ref-type=""bibr"">15</xref>] developed an approach to detect muscle activations and intensities as users perform facial exercises in front of a mobile device camera using AU intensity. Oliveira et al. [<xref rid=""B16"" ref-type=""bibr"">16</xref>, <xref rid=""B17"" ref-type=""bibr"">17</xref>] used a similar approach for hypomimia detection in Parkinson’s disease and for identifying signs of stroke. This work proposes using AUs to detect the differences in the facial expressions of ALS patients and healthy people; AUs have the advantage because these describe the actions. The Toronto NeuroFace Dataset [<xref rid=""B18"" ref-type=""bibr"">18</xref>] was utilized, comprising nine video sequences that represent various facial expressions captured during routine orofacial examinations of both healthy controls (HCs) and patients with ALS. The AUs were computed for each of the video recordings and classified against the disease label. The primary contribution of this work is the demonstration of the use of AUs for differentiating between the facial expressions of ALS and healthy individuals. It has the potential to assist the neurologists to detect symptoms of ALS in their patients. This section outlines the dataset utilized in the study, the methods applied for extracting the AUs, and the grid search space used for classification. It also details the metrics employed in assessing the proposed model. This section presents the results obtained in the classification tasks. The experiments were conducted over the statistical information of 20 AUs computed for each task using the logistic regression classifier with hyperparameters optimized through a grid search approach to find the best model, i.e., the one that maximizes the accuracy. 
<xref rid=""T4"" ref-type=""table"">Table 4</xref> shows the results for HC versus ALS for each of the seven facial expression tasks. The highest accuracy was 0.91 for the SPREAD task when the min of AUs was used. Additionally, this table shows significant variations in performance across various tasks and features. Previous research [<xref rid=""B16"" ref-type=""bibr"">16</xref>] has shown that it is possible to distinguish between healthy individuals and PD patients using the variance of AUs. On the other hand, the present study extends the earlier work and shows the effectiveness of using AUs from facial videos to identify ALS individuals. Unlike the earlier studies, it has investigated different facial expression tasks and statistical measures to represent the facial expressions. The results have important implications, particularly for individuals with neurological diseases who commonly suffer from reduced facial expressions due to stiffness in facial muscles. The data indicate that AUs are capable of differentiating between healthy persons and those affected by ALS. This underscores the value of studying facial expressions and their associated symptoms in people with neurological conditions. It also highlights the facial expressions that are more affected and the AUs that detect these the best. The model considered for AU extraction, i.e., Py-Feat, was not trained or fine-tuned on a dataset that contains faces of people with neurological diseases. As a result, the prediction of the AUs is only estimated. A significant constraint of this research is the limited number of participants and their exclusive association with one hospital, potentially resulting in biases and limiting the model’s broad applicability. This is a pilot study with a small sample size. The small sample size can lead to higher variability and reduced confidence in the stability of the reported metrics. Additionally, because of the absence of longitudinal data, this cannot be evaluated for the long-term consistency and repeatability of the results. The tasks OPEN and SPREAD show high mean accuracy in <xref rid=""F4"" ref-type=""fig"">Figure 4</xref>. This suggests that these tasks might be better at differentiating between ALS and HC. The variation in performance across tasks indicates that certain facial movements might be more indicative of ALS-related changes, and the classifier’s performance is task-dependent. This warrants further investigation with larger datasets to validate these findings and explore the underlying reasons for these differences. It is important to note that the study has only considered the loss of facial expressions, which is only one of the symptoms of these complex, multi-symptom disease conditions. This should be considered to be the basis to assist the clinician and improved by adding other clinical observations, signs, and symptoms. Using facial videos in healthcare raises privacy issues and requires careful data management. This limits the scalability of such a study, and factors such as diversity in the datasets become difficult to address. We realize that addressing these is crucial for the success of AI-driven diagnostics to ensure they are unbiased and accurate, and we are considering these factors for future studies. Future research can strengthen the current findings by conducting a comparative study of different disease stages versus HCs. Such an approach would involve examining both facial expressions and other motor functions to better understand disease progression in comparison to a normal baseline. Utilizing advanced imaging techniques or motion capture may also help quantify differences in muscle activity and offer deeper insights into the onset and progression of disease-specific motor impairments. It would be advantageous to conduct longitudinal studies, where the same person can be monitored repeatedly over the progression of the disease. This would track the evolution of symptoms over time and validate the accuracy of predictive models, particularly in diseases where symptoms evolve gradually. Another extension of this work could be the inclusion of Patient-Reported Outcome (PRO) scores in future studies. Incorporating these scores, which reflect patients’ perceptions of their health status and quality of life, alongside clinical assessments of facial muscle function, could provide a correlation between objective measures and subjective patient experiences. This approach would offer a more holistic view of the disease’s impact on patients’ daily lives and could significantly improve the effectiveness of clinical assessments and treatment strategies. Finally, there is a need to develop remote smartphone-based video assessments for ALS. Abbas et al. [<xref rid=""B33"" ref-type=""bibr"">33</xref>] have shown that smartphone-based video assessments can provide an objective evaluation of motor abnormalities, and they have shown success in schizophrenia. The potential of using this technology for remote monitoring could make it suitable for patients living in remote or underserved areas where access to specialized ALS care is limited. This manuscript presents a preliminary investigation into the potential of using AUs obtained from facial videos to identify facial weakness symptoms in ALS patients. The model was cross-validated and the most suitable facial expressions, the corresponding AUs, and the statistical measures were identified, and the highest accuracy was 0.91 when the SPREAD facial expression task was performed. This shows that computerized analysis of videos of people performing facial expression tasks is a promising approach to assist clinicians in detecting ALS symptoms. The experiments were conducted over the Toronto NeuroFace Dataset [<xref rid=""B18"" ref-type=""bibr"">18</xref>], which comprises facial videos of ALS and HC group participants while performing nine predefined facial expression tasks. This study is based on a small dataset; additional research is necessary before its findings can be applied widely in clinical settings. Further investigations should focus on examining the impact of factors like ethnicity and age and optimizing these methods for more diverse patient populations, employing larger datasets to fill these gaps. Additionally, distinct techniques can be explored for extracting and correlating clinically significant information from facial AUs and specific clinical symptoms.

"Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis: Insights and New Prospects in Disease Pathophysiology, Biomarkers and Therapies","Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) is a severe neurodegenerative disorder marked by the gradual loss of motor neurons, leading to significant disability and eventual death. Despite ongoing research, there are still limited treatment options, underscoring the need for a deeper understanding of the disease’s complex mechanisms and the identification of new therapeutic targets. This review provides a thorough examination of ALS, covering its epidemiology, pathology, and clinical features. It investigates the key molecular mechanisms, such as protein aggregation, neuroinflammation, oxidative stress, and excitotoxicity that contribute to motor neuron degeneration. The role of biomarkers is highlighted for their importance in early diagnosis and disease monitoring. Additionally, the review explores emerging therapeutic approaches, including inhibitors of protein aggregation, neuroinflammation modulators, antioxidant therapies, gene therapy, and stem cell-based treatments. The advantages and challenges of these strategies are discussed, with an emphasis on the potential for precision medicine to tailor treatments to individual patient needs. Overall, this review aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the current state of ALS research and suggest future directions for developing effective therapies.","Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), also known as Lou Gehrig’s disease, is a progressive fatal neurodegenerative disease characterized by the loss of upper and lower motor neurons that weakens the muscles, ultimately resulting in paralysis [<xref rid=""B1-pharmaceuticals-17-01391"" ref-type=""bibr"">1</xref>]. Around 25% of patients experience bulbar symptoms such as slurred speech, difficulty swallowing, and weakness in facial muscles [<xref rid=""B2-pharmaceuticals-17-01391"" ref-type=""bibr"">2</xref>]. The prevalence is approximately 5/100,000 people/year globally, and on average the disease lasts for three years before demise [<xref rid=""B3-pharmaceuticals-17-01391"" ref-type=""bibr"">3</xref>]. However, 10% of patients may survive more than a decade [<xref rid=""B4-pharmaceuticals-17-01391"" ref-type=""bibr"">4</xref>]. ALS is most diagnosed in people between the ages of 58 and 60 [<xref rid=""B5-pharmaceuticals-17-01391"" ref-type=""bibr"">5</xref>]. Males are more susceptible to ALS than females, resulting in a male–female ratio of 1.2:1.5 [<xref rid=""B6-pharmaceuticals-17-01391"" ref-type=""bibr"">6</xref>]. A higher annual incidence rate is reported in Europe, at approximately 1–2 individuals/100,000 [<xref rid=""B7-pharmaceuticals-17-01391"" ref-type=""bibr"">7</xref>]. In contrast, results of population studies in East Asia and South Asia show incidence rates of0.8/100,000 individuals [<xref rid=""B8-pharmaceuticals-17-01391"" ref-type=""bibr"">8</xref>]. ALS is categorized broadly as familial and sporadic. Sporadic ALS (non-inherited) refers to cases where the disease appears in individuals without a known family history, whereas familial ALS (inherited) occurs when at least one of the family members is affected by the condition. Only about 10% of cases are familial (FALS), and the rest of them are sporadic [<xref rid=""B9-pharmaceuticals-17-01391"" ref-type=""bibr"">9</xref>]. Numerous genes have been linked to both sporadic and familial (inherited) forms of ALS. The most studied ALS-related genes include <italic toggle=""yes"">C9orf72</italic>, <italic toggle=""yes"">SOD1</italic>, <italic toggle=""yes"">TARDBP</italic> (<italic toggle=""yes"">TDP-43</italic>), and <italic toggle=""yes"">FUS</italic>, among others. Studying the roles of these genes in ALS pathogenesis is very important for developing targeted therapies and for better management of the disease. ALS, being a fatal disease, has no cure, and current treatments only modestly slow its progression without stopping the eventual decline; therefore, developing effective therapeutics is critically important. The lack of a defined cause of the disease is mirrored in the number of therapeutics currently available. There are only two approved treatments for ALS despite previous and ongoing trials: Riluzole [<xref rid=""B10-pharmaceuticals-17-01391"" ref-type=""bibr"">10</xref>] and Edaravone, whose mechanism of action is unclear but assumed to be through their antioxidant properties [<xref rid=""B11-pharmaceuticals-17-01391"" ref-type=""bibr"">11</xref>]. These drugs marginally slow down the progression of the disease but do not cure it. Many novel therapeutics are entering clinical trials with the aim of finding more effective treatments and, ultimately, a cure. <xref rid=""pharmaceuticals-17-01391-f001"" ref-type=""fig"">Figure 1</xref> depicts the genetic mutations, pathophysiological mechanisms, diagnostic methods, and treatment strategies for ALS. Although significant research has been conducted, the underlying cause of ALS remains unknown, and there is still no cure. This highlights the critical need for a deeper understanding of the disease and its progression. In light of this, the review aims to provide key insights into ALS pathology, the biomarkers used for diagnosis, and the therapies currently in use. By presenting this information, it seeks to offer a stronger foundation for developing novel and more effective treatments. As research continues to evolve, gaining a better understanding of ALS at both molecular and clinical levels could lead to promising therapeutic advancements. ALS is a devastating neurodegenerative disorder characterized by the continuous degeneration of motor neurons in the brain and spinal cord [<xref rid=""B12-pharmaceuticals-17-01391"" ref-type=""bibr"">12</xref>]. In ALS, the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), mitophagy, and autophagy are main contributors to cellular dysfunction that leads to motor neuron degeneration. ER stress is a crucial component of ALS pathology and is responsible for protein folding, lipid synthesis, and calcium homeostasis. Protein misfolding and accumulation due to genetic mutations such as <italic toggle=""yes"">SOD1</italic> and <italic toggle=""yes"">TDP-43</italic> overload the ER, triggering ER stress. Persistent ER stress results in apoptosis and contributes to motor neuron death [<xref rid=""B13-pharmaceuticals-17-01391"" ref-type=""bibr"">13</xref>]. Mitophagy, the selective degradation of damaged mitochondria through autophagy, is essential for mitochondrial quality control. In ALS, dysfunctional mitophagy contributes to mitochondrial damage and impaired energy production, particularly in motor neurons. Mutations in genes like <italic toggle=""yes"">C9orf72</italic> and <italic toggle=""yes"">OPTN</italic> disrupt the mitophagic process, leading to the accumulation of defective mitochondria. This results in increased oxidative stress, calcium dysregulation, and neuronal energy deficits, all of which aggravate motor neuron damage [<xref rid=""B14-pharmaceuticals-17-01391"" ref-type=""bibr"">14</xref>]. Autophagy, the broader process of degrading and recycling damaged cellular components, is important for maintaining cellular homeostasis. In ALS, autophagic pathways are dysregulated, resulting in the accumulation of toxic aggregates, such as misfolded proteins and damaged organelles. This accumulation exceeds the cells’ capacity for degradation. This impaired autophagy contributes to cellular stress, protein aggregation, and ultimately the degeneration of motor neurons [<xref rid=""B15-pharmaceuticals-17-01391"" ref-type=""bibr"">15</xref>]. Three theories explain ALS pathogenesis. The first, the dying forward hypothesis, posits that ALS starts in the cortex, affecting corticospinal motor neurons (MNs) linked to spinal cord MNs via monosynaptic connections. Glutamate excitotoxicity is believed to cause MN degeneration along the axon [<xref rid=""B16-pharmaceuticals-17-01391"" ref-type=""bibr"">16</xref>]. The second theory, the dying back hypothesis, suggests ALS begins with lower MN dysfunction, possibly originating from muscle or the neuromuscular junction. The retrograde transport of harmful substances leads to toxicity, potentially linked to axoplasmic transport dysfunction [<xref rid=""B17-pharmaceuticals-17-01391"" ref-type=""bibr"">17</xref>,<xref rid=""B18-pharmaceuticals-17-01391"" ref-type=""bibr"">18</xref>]. The third theory, the independent degeneration hypothesis, proposes autonomous degenerative changes in corticospinal and lower MNs, spreading along their neuroanatomical pathways [<xref rid=""B17-pharmaceuticals-17-01391"" ref-type=""bibr"">17</xref>]. ALS exhibits diverse characteristics, including varying corticospinal or lower MN involvement and distinct disease progression rates [<xref rid=""B19-pharmaceuticals-17-01391"" ref-type=""bibr"">19</xref>]. The precise pathophysiology of ALS is not fully understood, but multiple mechanisms have been associated with its development and progression (<xref rid=""pharmaceuticals-17-01391-f002"" ref-type=""fig"">Figure 2</xref>). Several molecular mechanisms underpin the pathophysiology of ALS. A primary mechanism involves mutations in the <italic toggle=""yes"">SOD1</italic> gene, leading to protein misfolding and aggregation. Mutant <italic toggle=""yes"">SOD1</italic> disrupts the redox balance, producing abnormal reactive oxygen species and reactive nitrogen species [<xref rid=""B20-pharmaceuticals-17-01391"" ref-type=""bibr"">20</xref>,<xref rid=""B21-pharmaceuticals-17-01391"" ref-type=""bibr"">21</xref>]. The accumulation of improperly folded proteins, including TDP-43 and SOD1, leadsto protein aggregation and neuronal toxicity [<xref rid=""B22-pharmaceuticals-17-01391"" ref-type=""bibr"">22</xref>]. SOD1 is transported to mitochondria by the translocase of the outer membrane complex despite lacking a mitochondrial localization signal. Within mitochondria, mutant <italic toggle=""yes"">SOD1</italic> builds up in the intermembrane space (IMS) and matrix, leading to toxic effects [<xref rid=""B23-pharmaceuticals-17-01391"" ref-type=""bibr"">23</xref>]. Misfolded SOD1 accumulates on the outer mitochondrial membrane (OMM) and contributes to apoptosis reliant on mitochondria. It is noteworthy that introducing external mutant <italic toggle=""yes"">SOD1</italic> aggregates has been shown to induce the misplacement of TDP-43 into the cytoplasm and intensify its aggregation [<xref rid=""B23-pharmaceuticals-17-01391"" ref-type=""bibr"">23</xref>]. Oxidative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction, and excitotoxicity contribute to neuronal damage and death in ALS. Elevated levels of metal ions can exacerbate these issues by inducing oxidative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction, protein misfolding, DNA damage, and endoplasmic reticulum stress, further advancing the progression of the disease [<xref rid=""B24-pharmaceuticals-17-01391"" ref-type=""bibr"">24</xref>,<xref rid=""B25-pharmaceuticals-17-01391"" ref-type=""bibr"">25</xref>,<xref rid=""B26-pharmaceuticals-17-01391"" ref-type=""bibr"">26</xref>]. Oxidative stress contributes to ALS development and motor neuron degeneration, leading to increased oxidative stress biomarkers in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), plasma, and urine. Environmental factors can increase systemic oxidative stress, accelerating ALS progression [<xref rid=""B27-pharmaceuticals-17-01391"" ref-type=""bibr"">27</xref>,<xref rid=""B28-pharmaceuticals-17-01391"" ref-type=""bibr"">28</xref>]. Glial cell dysfunction, particularly involving astrocytes and microglia, also plays a crucial role in ALS pathophysiology through neuroinflammation and impaired support of neuronal function [<xref rid=""B29-pharmaceuticals-17-01391"" ref-type=""bibr"">29</xref>]. Genetic factors are implicated in both familial and sporadic forms of ALS, with mutations in genes such as <italic toggle=""yes"">C9ORF72</italic>, <italic toggle=""yes"">SOD1</italic>, <italic toggle=""yes"">TARDBP</italic>, and <italic toggle=""yes"">FUS</italic> contributing to disease susceptibility.  While 90–95% of ALS cases are sporadic (sALS), 5–10% of familial ALS cases are linked to mutations in the <italic toggle=""yes"">TARDBP</italic> gene. The remaining 90–95% of familial cases are caused by mutations in other genes, such as <italic toggle=""yes"">C9ORF72</italic> (Hexanucleotide repeat expansion in <italic toggle=""yes"">C9ORF72</italic>), <italic toggle=""yes"">SOD1</italic>, <italic toggle=""yes"">FUS</italic>, and <italic toggle=""yes"">NEK1</italic> (NIMA-like kinase 1). Interestingly, up to 97% of sporadic ALS patients also have TDP-43 protein deposits in their neuronal inclusions, indicating a crucial role for TDP-43 in ALS pathology [<xref rid=""B30-pharmaceuticals-17-01391"" ref-type=""bibr"">30</xref>]. Dysfunction in RNA metabolism, protein homeostasis, and axonal transport further exacerbates motor neuron vulnerability in ALS. Defects in axonal transport and mitochondrial dysfunction play critical roles in motor neuron degeneration, further aggravating the disease progression [<xref rid=""B31-pharmaceuticals-17-01391"" ref-type=""bibr"">31</xref>]. RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) feature highly conserved RNA recognition motifs (RRMs) and play vital roles in various RNA metabolic processes, including mRNA processing, RNA export, and RNA stability. Certain RBPs, like TDP-43, are linked to neurodegenerative diseases, suggesting that disruptions in RNA metabolism may be a causative factor [<xref rid=""B32-pharmaceuticals-17-01391"" ref-type=""bibr"">32</xref>,<xref rid=""B33-pharmaceuticals-17-01391"" ref-type=""bibr"">33</xref>,<xref rid=""B34-pharmaceuticals-17-01391"" ref-type=""bibr"">34</xref>]. Two RRM domains of TDP-43 (RRM1 and RRM2), separated by 15 amino acids, bind RNA/DNA with a preference for UG/TG-rich sequences [<xref rid=""B35-pharmaceuticals-17-01391"" ref-type=""bibr"">35</xref>,<xref rid=""B36-pharmaceuticals-17-01391"" ref-type=""bibr"">36</xref>]. ALS-linked mutations P112H and D169G disrupt RNA binding without affecting recognition [<xref rid=""B37-pharmaceuticals-17-01391"" ref-type=""bibr"">37</xref>,<xref rid=""B38-pharmaceuticals-17-01391"" ref-type=""bibr"">38</xref>,<xref rid=""B39-pharmaceuticals-17-01391"" ref-type=""bibr"">39</xref>]. The RRM2 domain is suggested to contribute to TDP-43 protein dimerization. The ALS biomarkers play a crucial role in the prediction and prognosis of disease development, and the selection of suitable treatment strategies can be madeby identifying the biomarkers of ALS [<xref rid=""B75-pharmaceuticals-17-01391"" ref-type=""bibr"">75</xref>]. Biomarkers of ALS are further subcategorized based on their primary function in the disease process.  Diagnostic biomarkers are used to identify whether an individual is affected by a disease and indicates the possibility of a disease to develop in those individuals without any symptoms. Moreover, in patients with the disease diagnosed, the risk of future clinical events can be assessed using prognostic biomarkers, whereas, predictive biomarkers can help identify the specific treatments that provide the most benefit to patients. To measure the biological response to the treatment the patient is currently undergoing, response biomarkers are evaluated [<xref rid=""B76-pharmaceuticals-17-01391"" ref-type=""bibr"">76</xref>]. The biological markers can be analyzed in various biofluid samples, including the CSF, blood, urine, and saliva [<xref rid=""B76-pharmaceuticals-17-01391"" ref-type=""bibr"">76</xref>]. CSF samples require invasive collection; however, this provides direct access to the CNS. A blood sample involves easier collection, but its high protein levels complicates the diagnosis [<xref rid=""B77-pharmaceuticals-17-01391"" ref-type=""bibr"">77</xref>]. Urine samples, though easily accessible, provide limited and inconsistent information, while saliva is easy to collect and has scope for future research [<xref rid=""B76-pharmaceuticals-17-01391"" ref-type=""bibr"">76</xref>].  Neurofilaments, the neuronal cytoskeletal proteins that include light (NfL), medium (NfM), and heavy (NfH) chains, are the key biomarkers of ALS in the assessment of its progression, severity, and response to therapy [<xref rid=""B78-pharmaceuticals-17-01391"" ref-type=""bibr"">78</xref>]. These biomarkers can be detected in blood using the most advanced fourth-generation technologies [<xref rid=""B79-pharmaceuticals-17-01391"" ref-type=""bibr"">79</xref>]. The NfL levels in blood or CSF indicate ALS progression, severity, and survival. The NfL can help diagnose ALS early [<xref rid=""B80-pharmaceuticals-17-01391"" ref-type=""bibr"">80</xref>,<xref rid=""B81-pharmaceuticals-17-01391"" ref-type=""bibr"">81</xref>]. In the clinical trial conducted by ATLAS, elevated NfL levels were used to identify active disease in <italic toggle=""yes"">SOD1</italic> variant carriers [<xref rid=""B82-pharmaceuticals-17-01391"" ref-type=""bibr"">82</xref>]. Thus, it is a validated prognostic risk biomarker for ALS with potential applications in presymptomatic diagnosis and clinical trials. ALS involves immune system dysregulation, including innate and adaptive immune systems. Initially, the immune system will be active, further as the disease progresses harmful pro-inflammatory phase sets in [<xref rid=""B83-pharmaceuticals-17-01391"" ref-type=""bibr"">83</xref>]. Studies report that inflammatory markers like C-reactive protein (CRP) and Interleukin-6 (IL-6) have shown inconsistent results in predicting disease progression [<xref rid=""B84-pharmaceuticals-17-01391"" ref-type=""bibr"">84</xref>,<xref rid=""B85-pharmaceuticals-17-01391"" ref-type=""bibr"">85</xref>]. However, markers such as neuroinflammatory proteins like NfL and chitinases (CHIT1 and YKL-40), individually as well as when combined, have shown better prognostic results [<xref rid=""B86-pharmaceuticals-17-01391"" ref-type=""bibr"">86</xref>]. Additionally, immunophenotyping studies and the analysis of particular immune cells, such as regulatory T cells, along with the detection of autoantibodies in ALS patients, provide insights into the progression and survival of the disease [<xref rid=""B87-pharmaceuticals-17-01391"" ref-type=""bibr"">87</xref>]. ALS is characterized by metabolic abnormalities, including disrupted lipid and glucose metabolism, hypermetabolism, and dysfunctional mitochondria [<xref rid=""B88-pharmaceuticals-17-01391"" ref-type=""bibr"">88</xref>]. Cholesterol levels, especially HDL-C and LDL-C have shown inconsistent results in predicting ALS prognosis [<xref rid=""B89-pharmaceuticals-17-01391"" ref-type=""bibr"">89</xref>]. However lipidomics, an emerging technology, identifies more reliable lipid-based biomarkers such as ganglioside GA2 and ganglioside GM3 [<xref rid=""B90-pharmaceuticals-17-01391"" ref-type=""bibr"">90</xref>]. The elevated serum glucose levels and ferritin levels due to impaired glucose and iron metabolism respectively are linked to increased disease risk and mortality [<xref rid=""B91-pharmaceuticals-17-01391"" ref-type=""bibr"">91</xref>,<xref rid=""B92-pharmaceuticals-17-01391"" ref-type=""bibr"">92</xref>]. On other hand, a lower serum albumin level has been correlated with inflammation and worse outcomes [<xref rid=""B93-pharmaceuticals-17-01391"" ref-type=""bibr"">93</xref>]. Muscle damage markers like plasma creatinine and creatine kinase are promising biomarkers for ALS, reflecting disease severity and muscle denervation. Plasma creatinine serves as a prognostic tool as it has shown strong correlations with muscle strength, ALSFRS-R scores, and survival [<xref rid=""B94-pharmaceuticals-17-01391"" ref-type=""bibr"">94</xref>]. The decline of creatine kinase levels at diagnosis over time correlates with disease aggressiveness and survival [<xref rid=""B95-pharmaceuticals-17-01391"" ref-type=""bibr"">95</xref>]. Further, rising levels of cardiac troponin T (cTnT) arelinked to disease progression [<xref rid=""B96-pharmaceuticals-17-01391"" ref-type=""bibr"">96</xref>]. In addition to tracking key biomarkers like neurofilaments and inflammation, examining ALS-related genes, RNA-binding proteins (RBPs), and non-coding RNAs offers a more nuanced perspective on the genetic and molecular drivers of ALS. RBPs indicate the importance of RNA metabolism and protein aggregation in ALS pathology and its progression [<xref rid=""B97-pharmaceuticals-17-01391"" ref-type=""bibr"">97</xref>]. The deficiency of FUS due to aggregation and abnormal phase transition causes neuronal cell death, contributing to ALS [<xref rid=""B98-pharmaceuticals-17-01391"" ref-type=""bibr"">98</xref>]. The mutation of FET family proteins such as TAF15 and EWSR1 also leads to neurodegeneration and ALS progression. ATXN2, involved in RNA metabolism, has CAG repeat expansions and is associated with ALS [<xref rid=""B99-pharmaceuticals-17-01391"" ref-type=""bibr"">99</xref>,<xref rid=""B100-pharmaceuticals-17-01391"" ref-type=""bibr"">100</xref>]. ATXN2 and hnRNPs, such as hnRNPA1 and hnRNPA2/B1, interact with TDP-43, causing mutations in their prion-like domains triggering proteinopathies and ALS [<xref rid=""B101-pharmaceuticals-17-01391"" ref-type=""bibr"">101</xref>,<xref rid=""B102-pharmaceuticals-17-01391"" ref-type=""bibr"">102</xref>]. The mutation and mislocalization of thenuclear matrix protein MATR3 arelinked to ALS [<xref rid=""B103-pharmaceuticals-17-01391"" ref-type=""bibr"">103</xref>]. Non-coding RNAs, including circular RNAs (circRNAs), microRNAs (miRNAs), and long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs), serve as potential ALS biomarkers. The altered levels of MiRNAs like miR-27a and miR-124 are linked to ALS progression [<xref rid=""B104-pharmaceuticals-17-01391"" ref-type=""bibr"">104</xref>]. LncRNAs interact with ALS-related proteins such as TDP-43 and FUS, possibly contributing to the disease [<xref rid=""B105-pharmaceuticals-17-01391"" ref-type=""bibr"">105</xref>]. The increased levels of CircRNAs have been identified as potential blood-based biomarkers for ALS [<xref rid=""B106-pharmaceuticals-17-01391"" ref-type=""bibr"">106</xref>]. Treatment strategies for ALS are evolving, focusing on various approaches to slow disease progression and improve patient outcomes. Key therapeutic strategies include inhibiting protein aggregation using small molecules, modulating neuroinflammatory pathways to reduce neuronal damage, and employing antioxidant therapies for mitochondrial protection. Currently, precision medicine and personalized approaches such as gene therapy and stem cell therapy offer the potential to revolutionize ALS treatment. However, breakthroughs in genetics, biomarker discovery, and molecular profiling are enabling personalized treatments tailored to an individual’s molecular and genetic makeup. This allows for targeted therapies that address specific genetic abnormalities, enhance disease monitoring, guide treatment selection, and improve patient stratification [<xref rid=""B107-pharmaceuticals-17-01391"" ref-type=""bibr"">107</xref>]. ALS remains a damaging neurodegenerative disorder with significant clinical and therapeutic challenges. This review has provided a comprehensive overview of ALS, highlighting its epidemiology, pathology, and clinical symptoms. The necessity of developing effective therapies is underscored by the progressive and fatal nature of the disease, necessitating a deep understanding of its complex pathophysiology. The pathophysiology of ALS involves a confluence of molecular mechanisms, including protein aggregation, neuroinflammation, oxidative stress, and excitotoxicity. These interconnected pathways contribute to motor neuron degeneration and the progressive loss of muscle function. Advancements in the understanding of these mechanisms have facilitated the identification of potential biomarkers, offering hope for earlier diagnosis and a more precise monitoring of disease progression. Emerging therapeutic targets present new prospects for ALS treatment. Inhibiting protein aggregation with small molecules, modulating neuroinflammatory pathways through inhibitors of microglial activation, and utilizing antioxidant therapies to protect mitochondria represent promising strategies. Gene therapy approaches, such as RNA interference and gene editing, along with stem cell-based therapies aimed at neuroprotection and regeneration, also show significant potential. Precision medicine and personalized approaches are poised to revolutionize ALS treatment, customizing treatments to specific genetic and molecular profiles. As research continues to unravel the complexities of ALS, these innovative strategies are expected to enhance therapeutic efficacy and improve patient outcomes. Future studies should focus on translating these findings into clinical practice, optimizing existing therapies, and developing novel interventions that target the root causes of ALS.",N/A,18 10 2024
An Uncommon Overlap Syndrome Between Ankylosing Spondylitis and Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis—Case Report,"This case report describes an uncommon overlap syndrome between ankylosing spondylitis (AS) and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Initially, the patient was diagnosed with AS, for which he received various specific treatments, including TNF-α inhibitors. After five years of treatment with TNF-α inhibitor etanercept, the patient was referred for a full neurological assessment after he reported balance disturbances, postural instability, muscle weakness, and other neurological symptoms that indicated the presence of a neurological disorder. After a thorough investigation, the patient was diagnosed with ALS. This case report aims to contribute to the limited literature by providing a detailed case study regarding the crosstalk between AS and ALS while also exploring the potential underlying mechanisms and the possible link between TNF-α inhibitors therapy and ALS.","Ankylosing spondylitis (AS) is an autoimmune spondyloarthropathy involving spine and sacroiliac joints as well as their adjacent tendons and ligaments; it belongs to a larger group of spondyloarthropathies with common clinical and genetic characteristics and in severe cases may lead to fibrosis and calcification ultimately causing the loss of flexibility of the spine. The disease also involves the inflammation of the hips, shoulder, and peripheral joints and may cause extraarticular manifestations such as inflammatory bowel disease or psoriasis [<xref rid=""B1-medicina-60-01703"" ref-type=""bibr"">1</xref>]. Neurological complications cannot be seen often in AS patients; however, they have been described as root lesions (radiculopathies), cauda equina syndrome, myelopathies (compression of the spinal cord), and myopathies [<xref rid=""B2-medicina-60-01703"" ref-type=""bibr"">2</xref>]. The primary underlying mechanisms involved in AS nervous system co-morbidities are compression and inflammation, followed by arteritis and demyelination [<xref rid=""B2-medicina-60-01703"" ref-type=""bibr"">2</xref>]. The inflammation triggers a consecutive repair process in which the soft tissue is ossified and fused, thus leading to bone outgrowths. With the progression of the disease, the overgrowth of the bone can lead to spinal stenosis and a fragile, stiff spine that can result in fractures, even in minor accidents [<xref rid=""B2-medicina-60-01703"" ref-type=""bibr"">2</xref>]. Moreover, in AS patients, the inflammatory tissue and the structural changes of the spinal canal can also lead to compression and cord and nerve impingement [<xref rid=""B2-medicina-60-01703"" ref-type=""bibr"">2</xref>]. Focal neurological manifestations may be accompanied by cognitive deficits, presumably due to the neurodegeneration induced by systemic inflammation; also, it has been postulated that the long-term administration of anti-inflammatory drugs may affect the volume of the hippocampus, which can be associated with cognitive deficit [<xref rid=""B3-medicina-60-01703"" ref-type=""bibr"">3</xref>]. A similar observation was reported in a population-based study that reported a higher risk of dementia in people with AS [<xref rid=""B4-medicina-60-01703"" ref-type=""bibr"">4</xref>]. A recent study demonstrated the presence of various brain structural and functional abnormalities associated with pain and fatigue in the brain of AS patients, as well as changes that were related to BASDAI and inflammation levels [<xref rid=""B5-medicina-60-01703"" ref-type=""bibr"">5</xref>]. Although they are not frequent, neurological disorders have been associated with AS; such disorders include multiple sclerosis (MS) [<xref rid=""B6-medicina-60-01703"" ref-type=""bibr"">6</xref>], although the two could be separate, non-related conditions, focal epilepsy and vertebrobasilar insufficiency [<xref rid=""B7-medicina-60-01703"" ref-type=""bibr"">7</xref>]. Despite a limited number of studies and cases where AS is associated with MS, a common factor in both AS and MS pathogeny seems to be dysregulated T-cell activity, specifically the Th17 subpopulation. This subset of lymphocytes increases the production of IL-17 and can cross the blood-brain barrier, disrupting it by inducing the activation of various inflammatory cells in the central nervous system [<xref rid=""B8-medicina-60-01703"" ref-type=""bibr"">8</xref>]. In recent years, studies have shown the involvement of the Th17/IL-17 pathway in the pathogenesis of both AS and MS [<xref rid=""B9-medicina-60-01703"" ref-type=""bibr"">9</xref>,<xref rid=""B10-medicina-60-01703"" ref-type=""bibr"">10</xref>,<xref rid=""B11-medicina-60-01703"" ref-type=""bibr"">11</xref>]; positive results were obtained after the treatment with secukinumab, a monoclonal antibody that inhibits the activity of IL-17, in patients with both AS and MS [<xref rid=""B12-medicina-60-01703"" ref-type=""bibr"">12</xref>]. Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a neurodegenerative pathology that mainly affects the motor system but also displays extra-motor symptoms. ALS causes the loss of upper and lower neurons in the motor cortex, resulting in progressive muscle weakness, ultimately affecting respiratory muscles and causing death within 2–5 years after the onset of the symptoms; extra-motor symptoms that occur in approximately 50% of the patients include behaviour changes and difficulties in conducting daily tasks and speech disturbances [<xref rid=""B13-medicina-60-01703"" ref-type=""bibr"">13</xref>]. A familial pattern has been revealed, but most cases of ALS appear sporadically; there is a clear overlap between ALS and frontotemporal dementia (FTD) in terms of clinical, pathological, and genetic features, the diagnosis of FTD being established in 5–25% of ALS patients and acting as a negative prognostic factor [<xref rid=""B14-medicina-60-01703"" ref-type=""bibr"">14</xref>]. Studies reported the involvement of Th17 and IL-17 in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases, including ALS; Th17 cells and IL-17 directly promoted motor neuron degeneration, while treatment with anti-IL-17 reversed all the effects associated with IL-17 [<xref rid=""B15-medicina-60-01703"" ref-type=""bibr"">15</xref>,<xref rid=""B16-medicina-60-01703"" ref-type=""bibr"">16</xref>]. Consecutively, the study of IL-17 can be another key to understanding the shared immunological mechanisms between ALS and AS. Increasing evidence demonstrated the existence of another key factor in the development and progression of AS and ALS: mitochondrial dysfunction. In ALS patients, mitochondrial dysfunction seems to occur through various mechanisms, such as the reduced activity of mitochondrial complex I, alterations in mitochondrial fusion and fission processes, decreased mitochondrial membrane potential, disruptions in Ca<sup>2+</sup> homeostasis, and excessive reactive oxygen species (ROS) production [<xref rid=""B17-medicina-60-01703"" ref-type=""bibr"">17</xref>]. Although mitochondrial dysfunction is less studied in AS compared to ALS, several studies suggested that mitochondrial dysfunction and consecutive increased ROS production are mediators of AS pathogenesis [<xref rid=""B18-medicina-60-01703"" ref-type=""bibr"">18</xref>,<xref rid=""B19-medicina-60-01703"" ref-type=""bibr"">19</xref>,<xref rid=""B20-medicina-60-01703"" ref-type=""bibr"">20</xref>], thus highlighting another potential link between these diseases. Cases of AS overlapped with ALS are extremely rare in the medical literature. Although ALS is the most frequently encountered form of progressive motor neuron disease, it is still unclear if the two conditions coexist as separate conditions or if they are connected. This debate arose from the fact that the administration of TNF-α inhibitors as treatment for AS may trigger severe side effects, including central and peripheral demyelination disorders, due to the loss or decreased neuronal protection physiologically ensured by TNF-α activation [<xref rid=""B21-medicina-60-01703"" ref-type=""bibr"">21</xref>]; however, ALS may also occur in AS patients with no history of biological treatments [<xref rid=""B22-medicina-60-01703"" ref-type=""bibr"">22</xref>]. Here, we present the case of a patient with diagnosed AS who, after 8 years of various specific treatments, including TNF-α inhibitors, developed muscle weakness as well as other symptoms suspicious for neurological disorders. After a thorough neurological and imagistic evaluation, the patient was diagnosed with ALS based on nerve conduction velocity (NCV) test and electromyography (EMG). In 2016, a 55-year-old male patient, ex-boxer, previously diagnosed with primary arterial hypertension and type 2 diabetes mellitus, presented with symptoms of lumbar back pain lasting over three months, morning stiffness that improved with activity and did not disappear when resting. The patient evaluation also revealed a limitation of spine movement in the frontal and sagittal planes and an expansion restriction of the thoracic cage. Bilateral sacroiliitis grade III, bone oedema at the level of the sacroiliac joints and syndesmophytes at the level of L1–L2 and L3–L5 were confirmed radiographically and through magnetic resonance imaging (MRI, Siemens Magnetom Essenza, Munchen, Germany) (<xref rid=""medicina-60-01703-f001"" ref-type=""fig"">Figure 1</xref>). After another 5 years, the patient sought evaluation from a neurologist, accusing a decrease in muscle strength in the upper limbs, predominantly distal right > left, that persisted for several months, balance disturbances, postural instability, and a weight decrease of 7 kg in the last month. The patient was referred to undergo cerebral and cervical spine MRI (<xref rid=""medicina-60-01703-f002"" ref-type=""fig"">Figure 2</xref>). Based on the MRI results, the patient was advised to undergo further neurological evaluation for diagnostic purposes, specifically to exclude ALS. Consecutively, an NCV test and EMG (Nihon Kohden, Tokyo, Japan) were performed to assess muscular abnormalities and to confirm the suspected diagnosis. The blood test results revealed a positive expression of the human leukocyte antigen-B27 genetic marker (HLA B27), VSH = 74 mm/h, and C reactive protein (CRP) = 33 mg/mL. The Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Disease Activity Index (BASDAI) score was 7.7. Based on the available data, the patient was diagnosed with AS, axial form. The treatment started with NSAIDs (Diclofenac 150 mg and meloxicam 15 mg) and etoricoxib (90 mg/day, when needed). The patient underwent both physiotherapy and kinesiotherapy. In January 2018, the patient started biological therapy with 50 mg Etanercept 1/week. After another 5 years, the patient presented various neurological symptoms that prompted an evaluation from a neurologist. The results revealed the bilateral and symmetric presence of osteotendinous reflexes in the upper limbs, decreased osteotendinous reflexes in the lower limbs, a positive Babinski sign on the right part, and bilateral positive Hoffmann’s sign. The patient was assessed for motor deficits using the Medical Research Council (MRC) muscle power grade or equivalent. The results showed a tetraparesis with MRC grade 3 in the bilateral roots of the C8–T1 segment, MRC grade 4 in the bilateral C6 roots, and a tetraparesis with MRC grade 3 in the right deltoid. The local examination revealed a bilateral muscle atrophy of the upper limbs. The RMI results confirmed the presence of a preforaminal radicular arachnoid cyst occupying the right recess of the C4–C5 segment without foraminal involvement, contrast substance uptake, and any compressive effect on the spinal cord. The spinal cord was not displaced, with no evidence of myelopathy at this level. Ischemic lesions within normal ranges were predominantly found in the cortical-subcortical frontal area. The neurological examination concluded that the neurological deficit the patient experienced was not related to the presence of the arachnoidian cyst. No surgical intervention was recommended for the arachnoid cyst as it did not compress the spinal cord or nerve roots. Also, the cerebral lesions found were not significant enough to justify the tetraparesis and the bipyramidal syndrome. The patient was admitted to our unit for further neurological evaluation to exclude ALS and for treatment. Upon submission, the patient complained of gait and balance disturbances, frequent falls, impossibility of maintaining a prolonged orthostatic position, urinary incontinence, dysphonia, muscular atrophy with decreased muscle strength in both upper and lower limbs, loss of dexterity, inability to climb or descend the stairs alone, articular and dorsal pain. Some of these symptoms occurred after the initial neurological evaluation and have a progressive evolution towards a continuous aggravation. The hospital neurological evaluation revealed a conscious, cooperative, temporal-spatial-oriented patient; absent particular attitudes and involuntary movements; unsafe walking, with difficulty on toes, heels, and tandem; the Romberg test with unsystematised oscillations; tetraparesis upper limb: proximal right MRC + 3/5, proximal left MRC 4/5, distal right and left MRC 3/5; bilateral tetraparesis lower limbs: proximal MRC −4/5, distal MRC 4/5; mild muscle spasticity; muscular atrophies in the lower and upper limbs; good coordination revealed by the index-nose and heel–knee tests; absent patellar (PTR) and achillean (ATR) osteotendinous reflexes; present bicipital and tricipital reflexes; bilateral absent cutaneous-plantar reflex; joint pain in the lower limbs, upper limbs and spine, dysphonia, with swallowing difficulties, dysarthric speech. The Barthel Index for Activities of Daily Living score was 50, indicating a severe dependency in performing a task or activity. Based on the clinical data, the presence of ALS was suspected. The results of the NCV test and EMG revealed no alteration of the sensitive function; however, the bilateral motor function of the lower and upper limbs was significantly impaired (<xref rid=""medicina-60-01703-t001"" ref-type=""table"">Table 1</xref> and <xref rid=""medicina-60-01703-t002"" ref-type=""table"">Table 2</xref>). Slowed motor nerve conduction velocity, decreased compound muscle action potential (CMAP), diffuse fasciculation, positive sharp waves, prolonged distal motor latency, increased motor unit potential (MUP), and consistent fibrillation were present and confirmed the diagnosis of sporadic ALS. At discharge, the medical recommendations included periodic neurological follow-ups with NCV/EMG test along with a rheumatological follow-up, physiotherapy, and pharmacological treatment with riluzole (50 mg) 1-0-1, etanercept (50 mg) 1/week, <italic toggle=""yes"">Ginkgo biloba</italic> extract (40 mg)/day, vitamin B1 derivative and vitamin B6 (300 mg) 1-0-0, trospium chloride (30 mg) 1-0-0, atorvastatin (20 mg) 1-0-0 and esomeprazole (20 mg) 1-0-0. The overlap syndrome in rheumatology refers to the coexistence of two or more autoimmune connective tissue disorders [<xref rid=""B23-medicina-60-01703"" ref-type=""bibr"">23</xref>]; autoimmune rheumatic diseases, either alone or combined in an overlap syndrome, may display central or peripheral nervous system involvement due to common autoimmune mechanisms [<xref rid=""B24-medicina-60-01703"" ref-type=""bibr"">24</xref>]. However, autoimmune rheumatic disease displaying pure motor neuron involvement, clearly diagnosed ALS or other motor neuron pathologies, has rarely been reported in the literature. This aspect is described in a recent publication [<xref rid=""B25-medicina-60-01703"" ref-type=""bibr"">25</xref>], where only 13 cases of ALS overlapping with rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus, and Sjogren’s disease were found after a thorough literature search. The vast majority of reported disease overlap involving ALS consisted of the simultaneous presence of multiple sclerosis [<xref rid=""B26-medicina-60-01703"" ref-type=""bibr"">26</xref>], dementia [<xref rid=""B27-medicina-60-01703"" ref-type=""bibr"">27</xref>], and myasthenia gravis [<xref rid=""B28-medicina-60-01703"" ref-type=""bibr"">28</xref>]. Studies show that most ALS-identified genes are pleiotropic, thus causing multiple disease phenotypes; ALS shares genes with other neuromuscular or neurodegenerative conditions such as dementia, spinal muscular atrophy, myopathy, Parkinsonism, ataxia, neuropathy, hereditary spastic paraplegia, primary lateral sclerosis [<xref rid=""B29-medicina-60-01703"" ref-type=""bibr"">29</xref>]. In turn, the overlap of rheumatic diseases and neurological diseases relies on autoantibodies, cytokines, chemokines, and factors that cause blood-brain barrier (BBB) dysfunction without a clearly identified mechanism. Apparently, the inflammation of the BBB facilitates the transfer of autoantibodies into the cerebrospinal fluid, which seems to be the main cause of central nervous system involvement in rheumatic diseases. Additionally, autoimmune vasculopathy and coagulopathy may be contributing factors [<xref rid=""B25-medicina-60-01703"" ref-type=""bibr"">25</xref>]. The reflexes examination played an important role in patient evaluation, as the neurological findings offered valuable information regarding the degree of upper motor neuron (UMN) and lower motor neuron (LMN) alterations. The positive Babinski sign on the right side and the bilateral positive Hoffmann’s sign suggested damage to the corticospinal tract, indicative of underlying UMN damage. The presence of bicipital and tricipital reflexes revealed that the degeneration of UMN has not yet significantly affected the arms. However, the decreased osteotendinous reflexes in the lower limbs, absent PTR, absent ATR, and the bilateral absent cutaneous-plantar reflex suggested the presence of severe LMN deterioration. These observations are consistent with ALS, where the clinical presentation of the patient is indeed a combination of upper motor signs and lower motor neuron signs, and in our case, also explained the muscle atrophy, inability to climb or descend the stairs alone, unsafe walking, areflexia and other signs and symptoms encountered when the patient was admitted to our unit. Cases of overlapped AS and ALS are rarely reported in the literature; to the best of our knowledge, only three cases were previously published, and, as a rule, the occurrence of neurological disorders in AS patients was not definitely linked to the evolution of the disease. The first case, reported by Loustau et al. in 2009, presented a 57-year-old patient diagnosed with ankylosing spondylitis who, due to resistance to non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, was started on treatment with the TNF-α inhibitor infliximab. After 1 month of treatment, the patient developed symptoms consistent with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, which was confirmed following an electrophysiological assessment [<xref rid=""B30-medicina-60-01703"" ref-type=""bibr"">30</xref>]. The case presentation raised the issue of a potential causality relationship between the development of ALS and the TNF-α induced inhibition due to the fact that in ALS cases, a clear TNF-α activation was reported presumably as a neuroprotective mechanism. A second case reported a 44-year-old AS patient who was initially diagnosed with cervical myelopathy caused by intraspinal ligament ossification, but then a final ALS diagnosis was established based on electroneuromyography [<xref rid=""B31-medicina-60-01703"" ref-type=""bibr"">31</xref>]. As the authors pointed out, in rheumatic diseases, including AS, a series of neurological and musculoskeletal symptoms may occur, creating confusion with neurological diseases and delaying proper diagnosis; the study could not clarify if ALS developed as a complication of AS. However, in this case, the patient had not received TNF-α inhibitors; therefore, ALS cannot be regarded as a drug therapy complication. The patient was treated irregularly with sulfasalazine, which acts as a ferroptosis inducer by inhibiting the xCT system; ferroptosis is a particular iron-dependent type of programmed cell death due to lipid peroxidation which was described in most neurodegenerative diseases together with dysregulated iron homeostasis and decreased glutathione [<xref rid=""B32-medicina-60-01703"" ref-type=""bibr"">32</xref>]. Since ferroptosis inhibitors were revealed as neuroprotectors in animal models as well as clinical trials and suggested as treatment against various neurodegenerative disorders, including ALS, one may state that sulfasalazine may cause neuronal damage and indirectly contribute to the development of neural disorders. Controversially, sulfasalazine was reported as a neuroprotector in a transient cerebral and retinal ischemia rat model where its systemic administration reduced neuronal death; the underlying mechanism consisted of the blockage of NMDA receptors and subsequent prevention of Ca ions influx and accumulation [<xref rid=""B33-medicina-60-01703"" ref-type=""bibr"">33</xref>]. Therefore, sulfasalazine was suggested as a potential therapeutic agent against neurodegenerative diseases. These controversial findings make it impossible to designate sulfasalazine as either neuroprotector or neuro-damaging in that particular patient which supports the conclusion that ALS cannot be regarded as a complication of drug therapy. The third case described a 39 years old patient who had been diagnosed with AS at the age of 31, but the authors failed to indicate the recommended treatment, if any; 8 years after the onset of the disease, the patient complained of muscle weakness, speech difficulties and occasional choking which indicated motor neuron disease [<xref rid=""B22-medicina-60-01703"" ref-type=""bibr"">22</xref>]. Following clinical and radiological examination, as well as electromyography and nerve conduction velocity study, he was diagnosed with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, the most common form of motor neuron disease. In this particular case, due to the lack of provided information, one cannot establish a potential link between ALS and drug therapy; however, the question remains if ALS occurs as a separate condition or consequent to AS complications. In our case, the patient received biological therapy with etanercept, a TNF-α inhibitor, for the last 5 years as a treatment against AS. TNF-α inhibitors have been suggested by several studies as responsible for the potential development of neurodegenerative co-morbidities when used as therapeutic agents in rheumatic diseases [<xref rid=""B31-medicina-60-01703"" ref-type=""bibr"">31</xref>]. TNF-α is an immune cytokine that targets two different receptors and activates various signalling cascades, triggering cellular responses depending on its molecular configuration and concentration; these complex mechanisms provide TNF-α with antagonistic effects in the central nervous system, the cytokine promoting both neuroprotective and neurotoxic, inflammatory activities [<xref rid=""B34-medicina-60-01703"" ref-type=""bibr"">34</xref>]. As a result, TNF-α inhibitors can be successfully used as a therapy against autoimmune inflammatory diseases, where they are more effective than disease-modifying drugs but proved detrimental against neurodegenerative disorders such as multiple sclerosis. The literature reports several cases where the use of TNF-α inhibitors caused demyelination in the central and peripheral nervous system, but the exact underlying mechanism could not be established [<xref rid=""B35-medicina-60-01703"" ref-type=""bibr"">35</xref>]. A safer therapeutic approach could involve TNF-α inhibitors that specifically target TNF receptor-1 and avoid or even stimulate TNF receptor-2 due to the latter’s antagonistic effects on TNF receptor-1. A study conducted in 2019 assessed a potential link between the administration of TNF-α inhibitors for various periods (12-120 months) and the risk of ALS [<xref rid=""B36-medicina-60-01703"" ref-type=""bibr"">36</xref>]; the study revealed that the first symptoms of ALS occurred after 12 to 18 months of treatment with TNF-α inhibitors with a strong association between drug exposure and ALS development. Consequently, the authors suggested therapy with TNF-α inhibitors is an ALS risk factor that should be avoided when neurological signs occur or in patients with known risks such as family predisposition. Etanercept is a non-selective TNF-α inhibitor that raised suspicions of neurological adverse effects. However, a study revealed that out of 75 patients receiving TNF-α inhibitor therapy, only three developed neurological side effects, and none of them was treated with etanercept [<xref rid=""B37-medicina-60-01703"" ref-type=""bibr"">37</xref>]. Moreover, the early administration of etanercept in a rat model of spinal cord injury dramatically reduced neuronal damage by decreasing both tissue and blood levels of inflammatory cytokines while stimulating antioxidative enzymes [<xref rid=""B38-medicina-60-01703"" ref-type=""bibr"">38</xref>]. Similar results were reported on in vitro and in vivo models of Alzheimer’s dementia where etanercept treatment reduced the concentration of pro-inflammatory cytokines and, subsequently, neuron injury by activating the c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) and nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) pathways thus exerting neuroprotectors effects. A possible explanation is that etanercept, in addition to binding to both TNF-α receptors, also binds to lymphotoxin LTα3, which exhibits a similar structure with the soluble form of TNF-α (sTNF), considered the active form, which displays a higher affinity for TNF-α receptor-1 and mediates chronic inflammation [<xref rid=""B35-medicina-60-01703"" ref-type=""bibr"">35</xref>]; in light of these findings, it was concluded that the selective inhibition of sTNF ensures the lack of neuronal adverse effects. Controversially, etanercept treatments were reported to cause demyelination events, such as the case of a patient with rheumatoid arthritis who developed transverse myelitis [<xref rid=""B39-medicina-60-01703"" ref-type=""bibr"">39</xref>] or other cases of patients who developed multiple sclerosis [<xref rid=""B40-medicina-60-01703"" ref-type=""bibr"">40</xref>,<xref rid=""B41-medicina-60-01703"" ref-type=""bibr"">41</xref>,<xref rid=""B42-medicina-60-01703"" ref-type=""bibr"">42</xref>]. However, to the best of our knowledge, no case of ALS has been reported to date in patients receiving etanercept as therapy for various diseases. Over the last decade, IL-17 inhibitors such as Ixekizumab and Secukinum have also been used for the treatment of AS, improving the clinical and biological signs of the active disease [<xref rid=""B43-medicina-60-01703"" ref-type=""bibr"">43</xref>]. However, due to increased data regarding its safety and proven long-term efficacy, TNF-α inhibitors are favored over IL-17 inhibitors; according to the update offered by the American College of Rheumatology/Spondylitis Association in 2019, TNF inhibitors are recommended over IL-17 inhibitors as the first biologic treatment to be used [<xref rid=""B44-medicina-60-01703"" ref-type=""bibr"">44</xref>]. Il-17 inhibitors are recommended in patients who do not respond to TNF-α inhibitors over the use of a second TNF-α inhibitor [<xref rid=""B44-medicina-60-01703"" ref-type=""bibr"">44</xref>]. In our case, the AS was well-managed using the TNF-α inhibitors; the patient presented an Ankylosing Spondylitis Disease Activity Score (ASDAS) score of 1 and normal erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESH) and C-reactive protein (CRP) values, indicating a low disease activity after etanercept treatment. Therefore, the patient did not meet the criteria for switching to IL-17 inhibitors. Moreover, considering the patient’s history as a former boxer in his youth, in our case, it is pertinent to mention the potential link between repeated head injuries and the risk of developing ALS. However, published studies revealed an association between severe head injury and ALS development only when severe head trauma occurred within one year before diagnosis [<xref rid=""B45-medicina-60-01703"" ref-type=""bibr"">45</xref>]. Furthermore, no significant association was found if the head injury occurred more than three years before the diagnosis of ALS [<xref rid=""B45-medicina-60-01703"" ref-type=""bibr"">45</xref>], as is our case. Studies of neurological complications of AS are quite rare in the medical literature. Khedr et al. reported in 2009 [<xref rid=""B2-medicina-60-01703"" ref-type=""bibr"">2</xref>] that 25% of patients with AS developed neurological symptoms due to myelopathy or radiculopathy; however, the study concluded that the subclinical neurological complications are more frequent than the clinical ones in AS. Older studies revealed that in AS, the compression of the cord and spinal canal occurs due to the structural changes of the latter [<xref rid=""B31-medicina-60-01703"" ref-type=""bibr"">31</xref>]. However, generally, neurologic involvement was reported in rheumatic conditions being considered a marker for an activated disease and significant morbidity [<xref rid=""B46-medicina-60-01703"" ref-type=""bibr"">46</xref>]; in AS, it consists in spinal cord involvement due to compression induced by bone changes, including spinal fractures and spinal stenosis. A comprehensive review identified pain in AS as a neuroimmune process with altered brain networks that heightened the neurological mechanisms of pain [<xref rid=""B47-medicina-60-01703"" ref-type=""bibr"">47</xref>]; in particular, the fatigue reported in AS appears to be associated with abnormalities within the sensorimotor network in the brain, which were also strongly linked to ALS where the altered functional connections may contribute to specific symptoms of the neurodegenerative disease [<xref rid=""B48-medicina-60-01703"" ref-type=""bibr"">48</xref>]. Neurological symptoms in AS include neuropathic pain with numbness and pricking sensations [<xref rid=""B49-medicina-60-01703"" ref-type=""bibr"">49</xref>] that also occur in neurodegenerative diseases such as ALS, further complicating the diagnosis. Medical professionals should be aware of the possibility of concurrent neurological illnesses and should ensure precise and accurate evaluations and diagnoses. The case presented in the current paper describes the rare overlap of an axial form of AS with ALS in a patient previously treated with the TNF-α inhibitor etanercept. The patient was diagnosed with ALS by means of an NCV test and EMG. A short review of the literature aimed to identify similar cases was conducted, and the collected data were assessed to determine whether ALS developed as an AS complication or is the result of the biological therapy with etanercept. The results are controversial, with arguments for both theories; on the one hand, the neurological involvement found in AS shows some resemblance with the symptoms reported in ALS, the pain revealing both an inflammatory and a neuropathic component. On the other hand, etanercept was revealed to have a complex effect on the central nervous system, exerting simultaneously a neuroprotector as well as neurotoxic activity due to its non-selective inhibition of the TNF-α receptors. As other authors concluded as well, the potential occurrence of ALS following a previous AS diagnosis should drive medical professionals to investigate the possibility of an ALS diagnosis in AS patients complaining of severe neurological symptoms. A second conclusion is a strong possibility for etanercept to cause demyelination events as a result of its TNF-α inhibition effect, which may trigger neurodegenerative diseases such as ALS. Future anti-inflammatory therapies of AS should focus on the administration of TNF-α selective inhibitors that target only the TNF receptor-1 or sTNF in order to reduce the risk of neurodegeneration. Also, the use of TNF-α inhibitors should be limited to cases of AS without a family history of autoimmune diseases that might be more susceptible to central nervous system demyelination.",N/A,17 10 2024
Sleep Disturbances in Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis and Prognostic Impact—A Retrospective Study,"Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a neurodegenerative disease associated with sleep disturbance, namely insomnia and sleep-disordered breathing. This study aims to evaluate the overall sleep characteristics of ALS patients, their association with lung function tests, and possible predictive survival factors. We conducted a retrospective observation study among ALS patients monitored during a pulmonology consultation. Type one polysomnography (PSG) and lung function tests were performed once the patients presented with sleep-related symptoms, and the relationship between their parameters was assessed, as well as a survival analysis. We included 35 patients, with an overall diminished sleep efficiency, a partially conserved forced vital capacity (FVC), and low maximal inspiratory pressure (MIP). A positive correlation between FVC and REM sleep percentage was observed. A survival analysis showed that a normal rapid eye movement (REM) sleep percentage and respiratory disturbance index (RDI) ≥ 15/h were independent predictors of survival. We observed a trend for higher sleep quality in patients with conserved lung function. A better sleep quality was associated with a higher survival. Obstructive events (reduced or absence of airflow associated with continued or increased inspiratory effort) did not seem to impact survival.","Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is the most common motor neuron disease in adults [<xref rid=""B1-life-14-01284"" ref-type=""bibr"">1</xref>]. It is a progressive neurodegenerative disease that impacts the central and peripheral nervous system and is characterized by the degeneration of inferior and superior motor neurons. This condition has a high phenotypic heterogeneity [<xref rid=""B2-life-14-01284"" ref-type=""bibr"">2</xref>].  The major risk factors for the development of ALS known to date are genetic predisposition, epigenetic changes, aging, and cumulative environmental exposures [<xref rid=""B3-life-14-01284"" ref-type=""bibr"">3</xref>,<xref rid=""B4-life-14-01284"" ref-type=""bibr"">4</xref>,<xref rid=""B5-life-14-01284"" ref-type=""bibr"">5</xref>]. ALS patients suffer from muscular atrophy, weakness, fatigue, and swallowing disorders. This assembly often leads to respiratory insufficiency, progressive functional loss of independence, and death [<xref rid=""B5-life-14-01284"" ref-type=""bibr"">5</xref>,<xref rid=""B6-life-14-01284"" ref-type=""bibr"">6</xref>]. The incidence and prevalence of ALS is variable, according to epidemiology studies. Chio et al. reported an average incidence in Europe of 2.8/100,000 and 1.8/100,000 in North America and an average prevalence of 5.4/100,000 in Europe and 3.4/100,000 in North America [<xref rid=""B5-life-14-01284"" ref-type=""bibr"">5</xref>]. Considering its distribution by gender, in Europe, this disease affects men more frequently, with an incidence rate ratio of 1.4 (male/female), according to Logroscino et al. [<xref rid=""B7-life-14-01284"" ref-type=""bibr"">7</xref>]. ALS is, by definition, a progressive disease, with an average survival of 20 to 48 months. However, 10 to 20% of patients exhibit a survival greater than 10 years [<xref rid=""B8-life-14-01284"" ref-type=""bibr"">8</xref>]. The disease has a generally late onset, although juvenile cases of ALS (before 25 years old) represent approximately 1% and cases before 45 years old account for approximately 10% [<xref rid=""B2-life-14-01284"" ref-type=""bibr"">2</xref>]. When symptoms of ALS are linked to dysfunction in the bulbar segment (such as dysphagia, sialorrhea, and dysarthria), patients are said to have a bulbar onset; in contrast, patients with a spinal onset usually first experience symptoms in their extremities, which are linked to dysfunction in the cervical, thoracic, or lumbosacral regions (such as stumbling or grasp weakness) [<xref rid=""B9-life-14-01284"" ref-type=""bibr"">9</xref>]. Many factors may cause sleep disturbances in ALS patients. Some may be a result of reduced mobility, muscle cramps, pain, and swallowing disturbances [<xref rid=""B10-life-14-01284"" ref-type=""bibr"">10</xref>,<xref rid=""B11-life-14-01284"" ref-type=""bibr"">11</xref>,<xref rid=""B12-life-14-01284"" ref-type=""bibr"">12</xref>]. Depression and anxiety may also lead to significant insomnia [<xref rid=""B13-life-14-01284"" ref-type=""bibr"">13</xref>]. Early and mid-sleep disturbances may also occur due to restless leg periodic limb movement disorder and increased myoclonic activity, seen in motor neuron disease due to its underlying neuropathy [<xref rid=""B14-life-14-01284"" ref-type=""bibr"">14</xref>,<xref rid=""B15-life-14-01284"" ref-type=""bibr"">15</xref>,<xref rid=""B16-life-14-01284"" ref-type=""bibr"">16</xref>]. In this disease, the sleep structure may be altered, namely with a decrease in total sleep time, its efficiency, rapid eye movement (REM) sleep percentage, and deep wave sleep percentage [<xref rid=""B13-life-14-01284"" ref-type=""bibr"">13</xref>,<xref rid=""B17-life-14-01284"" ref-type=""bibr"">17</xref>,<xref rid=""B18-life-14-01284"" ref-type=""bibr"">18</xref>,<xref rid=""B19-life-14-01284"" ref-type=""bibr"">19</xref>,<xref rid=""B20-life-14-01284"" ref-type=""bibr"">20</xref>,<xref rid=""B21-life-14-01284"" ref-type=""bibr"">21</xref>].  The presence of obstructive events (defined by reduced or absence of airflow associated with continued or increased inspiratory effort) [<xref rid=""B22-life-14-01284"" ref-type=""bibr"">22</xref>] during sleep, although common, do not often lead to oxygen desaturation [<xref rid=""B17-life-14-01284"" ref-type=""bibr"">17</xref>]. While some research indicates that obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) occurrences during sleep are rare in ALS patients [<xref rid=""B19-life-14-01284"" ref-type=""bibr"">19</xref>], other investigations reveal that OSA events are present in ALS patients [<xref rid=""B23-life-14-01284"" ref-type=""bibr"">23</xref>].  Hypoventilation, however, seems to be the main cause of nocturnal hypoxemia [<xref rid=""B13-life-14-01284"" ref-type=""bibr"">13</xref>,<xref rid=""B24-life-14-01284"" ref-type=""bibr"">24</xref>]. One of the main causes of sleep-induced hypoventilation is bilateral degeneration of phrenic nerve motor neurons, which results in gradual weakening of the diaphragm [<xref rid=""B25-life-14-01284"" ref-type=""bibr"">25</xref>,<xref rid=""B26-life-14-01284"" ref-type=""bibr"">26</xref>]. During REM sleep, hypoventilation sets in and skeletal muscle activity, including the external intercostal and accessory respiratory muscles, is actively inhibited [<xref rid=""B27-life-14-01284"" ref-type=""bibr"">27</xref>]. When diaphragmatic weakness occurs, there is insufficient alveolar ventilation to effectively exhale carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>). Considering that roughly 30% of individuals with evident hypercapnia will be overlooked if sleep tests solely include pulse oxymetry, capnographic instead of oxymetric methods are increasingly used to diagnose sleep-related hypoventilation in patients with neuromuscular disease or restrictive lung conditions [<xref rid=""B17-life-14-01284"" ref-type=""bibr"">17</xref>,<xref rid=""B28-life-14-01284"" ref-type=""bibr"">28</xref>]. Hypercapnia extends throughout non-REM sleep as diaphragm weakness worsens and eventually results in persistent hypercapnic respiratory failure. Sleep disturbances, such as stage transitions or intermittent arousals, can result from both hypercapnia and hypoxia [<xref rid=""B22-life-14-01284"" ref-type=""bibr"">22</xref>].  Owing to the potential for decreased lung function, pulmonology work up of ALS patients should include tests of pulmonary function, including parameters such as forced vital capacity (FVC), a measurement of the maximum air volume expelled with the greatest amount of effort, and maximum inspiratory pressure (MIP), which represents the diaphragm’s and other inspiratory muscles’ strength [<xref rid=""B29-life-14-01284"" ref-type=""bibr"">29</xref>]. These parameters are considered to be predictors of survival and ALS progression [<xref rid=""B30-life-14-01284"" ref-type=""bibr"">30</xref>,<xref rid=""B31-life-14-01284"" ref-type=""bibr"">31</xref>,<xref rid=""B32-life-14-01284"" ref-type=""bibr"">32</xref>]. However, these parameters are seldom investigated in the prediction of sleep-disordered breathing [<xref rid=""B33-life-14-01284"" ref-type=""bibr"">33</xref>,<xref rid=""B34-life-14-01284"" ref-type=""bibr"">34</xref>]. In the early stages of disease, sleep-disordered breathing may not manifest, and sleep disturbance in ALS patients may be caused by sleep architecture fragmentation, which enhances the need for type one polysomnography (PSG) [<xref rid=""B35-life-14-01284"" ref-type=""bibr"">35</xref>]. This test can accurately assess respiratory effort during sleep, identify different stages of sleep, detect anomalies in the electroencephalogram, and assess body position and limb movements [<xref rid=""B22-life-14-01284"" ref-type=""bibr"">22</xref>]. This makes the assessment more helpful in identifying other sleep disturbances that also affect ALS patients, such as insomnia and periodic limb movement disorders, besides sleep-disordered breathing. As such, this study aims to evaluate the overall sleep characteristics of patients with ALS (as well as the co-existence of sleep-disordered breathing), before the application of non-invasive ventilation (NIV) or continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP), their association with lung function tests, and possible predictor factors of survival.   The presented cohort of ALS patients shows considerable sleep impairment, represented by the overall diminished sleep efficiency. From the analysis of <xref rid=""life-14-01284-t001"" ref-type=""table"">Table 1</xref>, it becomes evident that this sleep disruption may not be fully attributed to the respiratory events but is strongly associated with ALS. Considering the lung function tests, our cohort exhibited a partially conserved FVC, with a diminished MIP and MEP. When analyzing the relationship between lung function and sleep quality (including sleep efficiency above 80%, REM sleep percentage above 20%, and arousal index below 10/h), we observed a trend for higher sleep quality in patients with conserved function, with FVC showing significant correlation with REM sleep percentage. Few studies address this potential relationship [<xref rid=""B37-life-14-01284"" ref-type=""bibr"">37</xref>], mostly focusing on subjective sleep parameters [<xref rid=""B38-life-14-01284"" ref-type=""bibr"">38</xref>]. Those who address this show non-significant results due to low recruitment or the nature of retrospective studies. In this study, a better sleep quality and higher RDI were associated with better overall survival. A possible cause for a better outcome in patients with RDI ≥ 15 could be the low percentage of bulbar onset patients in our cohort and the fact that an adequate treatment of the obstructive events is associated with better survival in other diseases, such as COPD [<xref rid=""B39-life-14-01284"" ref-type=""bibr"">39</xref>]. This finding can also be found in Engel et al.’s and Georges et al.’s studies [<xref rid=""B40-life-14-01284"" ref-type=""bibr"">40</xref>,<xref rid=""B41-life-14-01284"" ref-type=""bibr"">41</xref>]. Other studies, however, have showed contradictory results. Quaranta et al. compared two groups of ALS patients, one with OSA and the other without OSA, and found a higher survival rate in those without OSA [<xref rid=""B42-life-14-01284"" ref-type=""bibr"">42</xref>]; however, the patients included in this study showed no symptoms of hypoventilation and presented with a normal CO<sub>2</sub> value. In contrast, in our cohort, the PSG was conducted once the patient presented with symptoms. Therefore, our study included patients of different stages of the disease when tested rather than at disease onset. This may explain the disparity between both studies. Our study comes with considerable limitations, including a high selection bias, due to its retrospective nature. On the one hand, we only included patients referred to the ventilation consultation after the ALS diagnosis. On the other hand, as mentioned before, the PSG was conducted once the suspicion of sleep-related breathing disorder was brought up by the patients’ symptoms. As such, the absence of asymptomatic patients could also influence our results. Furthermore, due to the small number of patients in our investigation and the lack of capnography studies in many of them, the detection of hypoventilation may have been understated. In our study, we did not adequately evaluate symptoms and quality of life scores, the clinical outcomes that most matter to the individual patient, namely, ALS patients. In conclusion, our study indicates that ALS patients with sleep-related symptoms show significant sleep disturbance (sleep-disordered breathing or with other disturbances), highlighting the need for PSG in symptomatic patients with conserved lung function. It also revealed that lung function tests may be associated with sleep alterations. However, our cohort failed to find a cut-off in FVC and MIP which could predict the need for PSG in order to detection hypoventilation early. Nonetheless, our study allowed us to infer that a better sleep quality is associated with higher survival in ALS patients. A precocious diagnosis and adequate treatment of obstructive events also showed an association with better survival. Future research should therefore look at the reason behind the inefficiency in sleep, as well as potential therapeutic approaches for ALS patients. The best time to perform a PSG and how to determine when it is appropriate are still unanswered questions in the ALS diagnosis process.",N/A,11 10 2024
A Review of Biomarkers of Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis: A Pathophysiologic Approach,"Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a neurodegenerative disease characterized by progressive degeneration of upper and lower motor neurons. The heterogeneous nature of ALS at the clinical, genetic, and pathological levels makes it challenging to develop diagnostic and prognostic tools that fit all disease phenotypes. Limitations associated with the functional scales and the qualitative nature of mainstay electrophysiological testing prompt the investigation of more objective quantitative assessment. Biofluid biomarkers have the potential to fill that gap by providing evidence of a disease process potentially early in the disease, its progression, and its response to therapy. In contrast to other neurodegenerative diseases, no biomarker has yet been validated in clinical use for ALS. Several fluid biomarkers have been investigated in clinical studies in ALS. Biofluid biomarkers reflect the different pathophysiological processes, from protein aggregation to muscle denervation. This review takes a pathophysiologic approach to summarizing the findings of clinical studies utilizing quantitative biofluid biomarkers in ALS, discusses the utility and shortcomings of each biomarker, and highlights the superiority of neurofilaments as biomarkers of neurodegeneration over other candidate biomarkers.","Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a fatal neurodegenerative disease characterized by progressive degeneration of the anterior horn cells of the spinal cord, motor brainstem nuclei innervating bulbar muscles, and degeneration of corticospinal motor neurons [<xref rid=""B1-ijms-25-10900"" ref-type=""bibr"">1</xref>]. This pathognomonic loss of both upper and lower motor neurons results in progressive paralysis of spinal and bulbar innervated skeletal muscles and inevitable death within approximately three to five years of symptoms onset. Degeneration starts focally in the form of a spinal onset in two-thirds of patients and a bulbar onset in one-third of patients before contiguous dissemination to other areas [<xref rid=""B2-ijms-25-10900"" ref-type=""bibr"">2</xref>]. Concomitant degeneration of the frontotemporal lobes is reported to occur in at least 25% of patients [<xref rid=""B3-ijms-25-10900"" ref-type=""bibr"">3</xref>]. ALS primarily affects patients in late adulthood, with an average age of onset of 65 years [<xref rid=""B4-ijms-25-10900"" ref-type=""bibr"">4</xref>]. Most ALS cases (90%) are sporadic (sALS) with no family history of ALS, while the remaining minority (10%) are familial (fALS) [<xref rid=""B1-ijms-25-10900"" ref-type=""bibr"">1</xref>]. So far, over 40 genes have been linked to 11% of sporadic cases and nearly 70% of familial cases [<xref rid=""B5-ijms-25-10900"" ref-type=""bibr"">5</xref>,<xref rid=""B6-ijms-25-10900"" ref-type=""bibr"">6</xref>]. More genetic mutations are likely to be uncovered as research progresses. Diagnosis of ALS entails the exclusion of mimic conditions in the presence of clinical evidence of spatiotemporal progression of upper motor neuron (UMN) involvement combined with clinical or electrophysiological evidence of progressive lower motor neuron (LMN) involvement [<xref rid=""B7-ijms-25-10900"" ref-type=""bibr"">7</xref>]. Despite the disease’s fast progression, diagnostic delay ranges around 12 months, which is partly attributable to the disease’s heterogeneity and a lack of a specific biomarker [<xref rid=""B1-ijms-25-10900"" ref-type=""bibr"">1</xref>,<xref rid=""B8-ijms-25-10900"" ref-type=""bibr"">8</xref>]. Diagnostic delay of an average of one year for a disease that has a survival of three to five years is not only burdensome but could potentially narrow a possible therapeutic window [<xref rid=""B3-ijms-25-10900"" ref-type=""bibr"">3</xref>]. Indeed, confirmation of ALS diagnosis can cost a patient up to USD 20,000, highlighting the financial burden and the psychological burden of the journey to diagnosis [<xref rid=""B9-ijms-25-10900"" ref-type=""bibr"">9</xref>]. New diagnostic criteria have been recently developed to advance diagnostic sensitivity by essentially including progressive muscular atrophy as a variant of ALS. Despite the Gold Coast criteria having the highest sensitivity of the established criteria, they have a false negative rate of nearly 10% [<xref rid=""B10-ijms-25-10900"" ref-type=""bibr"">10</xref>]. Furthermore, about 10% of ALS-diagnosed cases are later revealed to be disease mimics [<xref rid=""B11-ijms-25-10900"" ref-type=""bibr"">11</xref>], emphasizing the need for highly sensitive and specific diagnostic tools. Limitations associated with the functional scales and the qualitative nature of mainstay electrophysiological testing prompt the investigation of non-invasive and more objective prognostic tools [<xref rid=""B12-ijms-25-10900"" ref-type=""bibr"">12</xref>]. Biomarkers have the potential to fill that gap by providing evidence of a disease process potentially early in the disease, its progression, and its response to therapy. Therapeutic options for ALS remain to be limited, as the only globally licensed drug (riluzole) offers a modest improvement in survival of a mere few months [<xref rid=""B13-ijms-25-10900"" ref-type=""bibr"">13</xref>]. Advancement in understanding of the variable pathophysiological mechanisms facilitated the development of numerous experimental therapies [<xref rid=""B14-ijms-25-10900"" ref-type=""bibr"">14</xref>,<xref rid=""B15-ijms-25-10900"" ref-type=""bibr"">15</xref>,<xref rid=""B16-ijms-25-10900"" ref-type=""bibr"">16</xref>]. However, the overwhelmingly unsuccessful translation of several previous experimental therapies in clinical trials [<xref rid=""B17-ijms-25-10900"" ref-type=""bibr"">17</xref>] highlights the intricateness of the disease and the need for more effective pharmacodynamic biomarkers [<xref rid=""B18-ijms-25-10900"" ref-type=""bibr"">18</xref>]. In contrast to other neurodegenerative diseases (NDs), such as multiple sclerosis (MS) and Alzheimer’s disease (AD), no biomarker has yet been validated in clinical use for ALS. Fluid biomarkers offer accessible quantitative measurements that can facilitate diagnosis, monitor progression, help identify therapeutic targets, and assess response to therapy. They are patient-convenient, reproducible, and relatively cost-effective [<xref rid=""B19-ijms-25-10900"" ref-type=""bibr"">19</xref>]. As the incidence of ALS is expected to increase exponentially by 2040 [<xref rid=""B12-ijms-25-10900"" ref-type=""bibr"">12</xref>], the need for established disease biomarkers grows even greater. Several fluid biomarkers have been investigated in clinical studies of ALS reflecting the different pathophysiologic processes, from protein aggregation to muscle denervation. This review takes a pathophysiologic approach to summarizing the findings of clinical studies utilizing quantitative biofluid biomarkers in ALS. Structure-based biomarkers [<xref rid=""B20-ijms-25-10900"" ref-type=""bibr"">20</xref>,<xref rid=""B21-ijms-25-10900"" ref-type=""bibr"">21</xref>] and function-based biomarkers [<xref rid=""B22-ijms-25-10900"" ref-type=""bibr"">22</xref>] are outside the scope of this review. Although our understanding of the pathophysiology of ALS remains incomplete, the identification of several pathogenic mutations has revealed various mechanisms. The most studied ALS-linked genes are chromosome 9 open reading frame (<italic toggle=""yes"">C9orf72)</italic>, Cu<sup>2+</sup>/Zn<sup>2+</sup> superoxide dismutase 1 (<italic toggle=""yes"">SOD1</italic>), TAR DNA binding protein (<italic toggle=""yes"">TARDBP</italic>), and fused in sarcoma (<italic toggle=""yes"">FUS</italic>), which collectively account for nearly 48% and 5% of familial and sporadic cases, respectively [<xref rid=""B23-ijms-25-10900"" ref-type=""bibr"">23</xref>]. Mutations in <italic toggle=""yes"">TARDBP</italic> and <italic toggle=""yes"">FUS</italic> lead to aggregation of the DNA and RNA binding proteins TARDBP 43-kDa (TDP-43) and FUS, respectively [<xref rid=""B7-ijms-25-10900"" ref-type=""bibr"">7</xref>]. Mutations in the <italic toggle=""yes"">C9ORF72</italic> gene lead to dipeptide aggregates, intranuclear RNA deposits, and, interestingly, TDP-43 aggregates [<xref rid=""B3-ijms-25-10900"" ref-type=""bibr"">3</xref>]. Mutations in the <italic toggle=""yes"">SOD1</italic> gene result in aggregation of the mutant SOD1, mitochondrial dysfunction, and consequently perpetuation of oxidative stress. Other less common mutations, such as tubulin alpha 4a (<italic toggle=""yes"">TUBA4A</italic>) and profilin 1 (<italic toggle=""yes"">PFN1</italic>), have been linked to disruption of axonal transport through cytoskeletal and tubulin defects [<xref rid=""B7-ijms-25-10900"" ref-type=""bibr"">7</xref>]. It used to be believed that the core pathology of ALS is aberrant aggregation of mislocalized or misfolded proteins in motor neurons [<xref rid=""B24-ijms-25-10900"" ref-type=""bibr"">24</xref>]. This is supported by the close association of neuronal loss with the burden of the proteinaceous inclusions in postmortem tissues [<xref rid=""B25-ijms-25-10900"" ref-type=""bibr"">25</xref>]. Protein aggregation follows protein misfolding or mislocalization due to mutations, oxidation, starvation, or cross-seeding. Protein aggregation interferes with cellular functions such as axonal transport, mitochondrial respiration, and stress response [<xref rid=""B26-ijms-25-10900"" ref-type=""bibr"">26</xref>]. Prion-like spreading of proteinaceous inclusions is seen in both familial and sporadic ALS [<xref rid=""B2-ijms-25-10900"" ref-type=""bibr"">2</xref>]. In 97% of ALS cases, there are cytoplasmic aggregates of mislocalized, ubiquitinated phosphorylated TDP-43, which normally works as a transcription factor in the nucleus [<xref rid=""B7-ijms-25-10900"" ref-type=""bibr"">7</xref>]. TDP-43 normally shuttles between the nucleus and the cytoplasm and has a prion-like domain, allowing it to accumulate into stress granules when needed. Stress induces the exit of the protein from the nucleus into stress granules, from which it can shuttle back to the nucleus after stress resolution. In ALS, it is irreversibly mislocalized to the cytoplasm either due to mutations or likely accumulated unresolved stress. The mislocalization of TDP-43 is believed to instigate sequelae of pathological alternations, including failure of mRNA splicing and subsequent depletion of certain proteins or, indeed, the development of proteins containing aberrant sequences [<xref rid=""B26-ijms-25-10900"" ref-type=""bibr"">26</xref>]. Additionally, aggregation of TDP-43 prevents the clearance of damaged proteins, causing impaired autophagy [<xref rid=""B7-ijms-25-10900"" ref-type=""bibr"">7</xref>]. FUS is another RNA-binding protein with a prion-like domain and a propensity to accumulate in stress granules. TDP-43 and FUS share several pathogenic features as their aggregates not only sequester proteins involved in RNA binding but can also recruit multiple proteins to aggregate through cross-seeding. Thus, they are aggregation-inducing proteins making way for the disease to propagate through contiguous cells [<xref rid=""B26-ijms-25-10900"" ref-type=""bibr"">26</xref>]. SOD1 is another protein with prion-like properties when misfolded. SOD1 aggregation disrupts mitochondrial respiration, axonal transport, and normal proteostasis through mechanisms that remain to be elucidated [<xref rid=""B26-ijms-25-10900"" ref-type=""bibr"">26</xref>]. Although the aforementioned toxic aggregates (TDP43, SOD-1, and FUS) share pathophysiological mechanisms, they do not coexist [<xref rid=""B26-ijms-25-10900"" ref-type=""bibr"">26</xref>]. Conversely, TDP43-positive inclusions coexist with dipeptide repeat (DPR) inclusions in ALS caused by mutations in C9ORF72. Mutations in <italic toggle=""yes"">C9ORF72</italic> are nucleotide repeat expansion mutations, which account for 40% of familial ALS cases. Identification of this mutation has informed a less protein-centric approach to ALS pathogenesis, marking aberrant RNA processing as a key mechanism for ALS. This is further supported by <italic toggle=""yes"">TDP43</italic> and <italic toggle=""yes"">FUS</italic>’s role in RNA processing [<xref rid=""B26-ijms-25-10900"" ref-type=""bibr"">26</xref>]. ALS is now recognized as a non-cell autonomous disease that involves non-neuronal cells as facilitators of neuronal death [<xref rid=""B26-ijms-25-10900"" ref-type=""bibr"">26</xref>]. Postmortem studies show low expression of the excitatory amino acid transporter 2 (EAAT2) in the brain and spinal cord of ALS patients. This is likely due to the deregulated processing of the EAAT2 mRNA transcript, which results in high glutamate concentration. High glutamate concentration activates N-methyl D-aspartate (NMDA) and alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA) receptors, resulting in excessive calcium influx and subsequent calcium overload. Calcium overload, which is primarily mediated by the glutamate receptor 2 (GluR2) subunit of AMPA receptors, overwhelms the mitochondria, resulting in oxidative stress [<xref rid=""B27-ijms-25-10900"" ref-type=""bibr"">27</xref>]. Additionally, calcium overload over-activates glial cells, which exacerbates free radical production, thereby perpetuating oxidative stress [<xref rid=""B28-ijms-25-10900"" ref-type=""bibr"">28</xref>]. Furthermore, calcium overload activates certain enzymes such as endonucleases, proteases, phosphatases, and phospholipases, which propagates excitotoxic cell death [<xref rid=""B27-ijms-25-10900"" ref-type=""bibr"">27</xref>,<xref rid=""B29-ijms-25-10900"" ref-type=""bibr"">29</xref>]. Neurons are generally susceptible to glutamate-induced excitotoxicity due to the inability to regenerate and permeability of activated glutamate receptors. This susceptibility of neurons can be exacerbated by existing mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative stress [<xref rid=""B29-ijms-25-10900"" ref-type=""bibr"">29</xref>]. Motor neurons are especially susceptible to excitotoxicity due to limited stress response, limited calcium buffering ability, and high expression of calcium-permeable AMPA receptors [<xref rid=""B26-ijms-25-10900"" ref-type=""bibr"">26</xref>]. Disruption of the blood–brain barrier (BBB) and the blood–spinal cord barrier (BSCB) is believed to occur in the early stage of the disease. Barrier disruption and glial activation allow for macrophage infiltration into the central nervous system (CNS). Neuroinflammation accelerates disease progression via an increase in cytotoxic immune cells as well as other mechanisms described in previous reviews [<xref rid=""B23-ijms-25-10900"" ref-type=""bibr"">23</xref>,<xref rid=""B27-ijms-25-10900"" ref-type=""bibr"">27</xref>]. Unlike other NDs, ALS progresses much more rapidly and with more heterogeneity between patients [<xref rid=""B30-ijms-25-10900"" ref-type=""bibr"">30</xref>]. Whether the contiguous spread of motor neuronal death occurs via anterograde degeneration or retrograde degeneration is debatable. It is likely, however, that the two processes occur concurrently [<xref rid=""B31-ijms-25-10900"" ref-type=""bibr"">31</xref>]. The result of both processes is the disassembly of the neuromuscular junction and the denervation of skeletal muscles [<xref rid=""B32-ijms-25-10900"" ref-type=""bibr"">32</xref>]. It is evident that several overlapping mechanisms are implicated in the pathogenesis of ALS, as illustrated in <xref rid=""ijms-25-10900-f001"" ref-type=""fig"">Figure 1</xref>. Motor neuron degeneration is believed to be the result of multiple hits, comprising protein misfolding, aberrant protein aggregation, neuroinflammation, oxidative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction, impaired RNA processing, glutamate excitotoxicity, and disturbed axonal transport [<xref rid=""B3-ijms-25-10900"" ref-type=""bibr"">3</xref>,<xref rid=""B26-ijms-25-10900"" ref-type=""bibr"">26</xref>]. These mechanisms appear to be interrelated and likely downstream of unknown primary insults triggered by the interaction of genetic, epigenetic, and environmental factors [<xref rid=""B33-ijms-25-10900"" ref-type=""bibr"">33</xref>]. An ideal biomarker for an ND would need to have the following characteristics. The biomarker should be stable in the fluid from which it is measured. The biomarker should be sensitive to ongoing injury and preferably specific to the underlying pathology [<xref rid=""B34-ijms-25-10900"" ref-type=""bibr"">34</xref>]. Its release into the surrounding cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) or through the BBB into the plasma should be passive and, therefore, reflective of the extent of pathology [<xref rid=""B35-ijms-25-10900"" ref-type=""bibr"">35</xref>,<xref rid=""B36-ijms-25-10900"" ref-type=""bibr"">36</xref>,<xref rid=""B37-ijms-25-10900"" ref-type=""bibr"">37</xref>,<xref rid=""B38-ijms-25-10900"" ref-type=""bibr"">38</xref>]. The biomarker should be easily isolated and analyzed, and its collection should be minimally invasive for patients [<xref rid=""B39-ijms-25-10900"" ref-type=""bibr"">39</xref>]. CSF has the advantage of being in direct contact with the CNS, but its use is limited by the invasiveness of lumbar puncture. On the other hand, blood sampling is less invasive, but its analysis is ultimately more complex as it contains a variety of proteins [<xref rid=""B40-ijms-25-10900"" ref-type=""bibr"">40</xref>]. Such biomarkers can be diagnostic, prognostic, predictive, or pharmacodynamic. Diagnostic biomarkers can distinguish those affected by the disease from those that are not. Diagnostic biomarkers can expedite diagnosis, therapeutic administration, and enrollment in early disease clinical trials [<xref rid=""B41-ijms-25-10900"" ref-type=""bibr"">41</xref>]. Predictive biomarkers determine which patient will likely experience an outcome in response to a clinical intervention. Validation of a predictive biomarker therefore requires a controlled trial including patients with and without the biomarker [<xref rid=""B42-ijms-25-10900"" ref-type=""bibr"">42</xref>]. Pharmacodynamic biomarkers can illustrate proof of targeting and downstream effector activity of candidate therapies to determine whether the therapeutic target has been achieved. On the other hand, prognostic biomarkers can predict an outcome, such as the rate of disease progression and severity, irrespective of treatment, thereby helping manage patients’ expectations and allocating appropriate healthcare plans [<xref rid=""B41-ijms-25-10900"" ref-type=""bibr"">41</xref>,<xref rid=""B42-ijms-25-10900"" ref-type=""bibr"">42</xref>]. Given ALS’s complex and intertwined pathophysiology, it is ambitious to expect one biomarker to tick all the boxes of an ideal biomarker. This article reviews evidence investigating the diagnostic, prognostic, predictive, and pharmacodynamic potential of quantitative biofluid ALS biomarkers. ALS is an intricate non-cell autonomous disease whose pathology encompasses multiple levels of the neuromuscular system with several interrelated mechanisms involving different cell types (including interneurons, microglia, and myocytes) through various molecular and genetic pathways. The development of biomarkers for ALS is complicated by its heterogeneity and the involvement of several converging pathogenic mechanisms. A significant number of biomarkers related to ALS pathophysiology can be measured in biofluids using readily available assays, as shown in <xref rid=""ijms-25-10900-t001"" ref-type=""table"">Table 1</xref>. Still, head-to-head comparison between biomarkers is not possible in most studies due to different study designs, different sample sizes, different control groups, and different protocols. This highlights the need for standardization of collection methods, procedures, controls, endpoints, and reporting guidelines tailored to ALS, as there have been for other neurological disorders [<xref rid=""B66-ijms-25-10900"" ref-type=""bibr"">66</xref>]. Blood biomarkers may be the most pragmatic due to noninvasive sampling and ease of longitudinal measurements, as illustrated in <xref rid=""ijms-25-10900-f003"" ref-type=""fig"">Figure 3</xref>. Still, blood is a complex compartment that requires a preemptive understanding of the possible interactions for a potential biomarker and the factors that might alter the levels of a biomarker, such as diet and comorbidities. Perhaps the most consistent findings in ALS biomarkers involve biomarkers of neurodegeneration, specifically NfL, which may be used to complement clinical diagnosis given its high sensitivity and the availability of its detection techniques. Additionally, NfL has had a consistent prognostic potential and potential utility as a pharmacodynamic biomarker, given its stability over time. Furthermore, as the elevation of NfL predates the emergence of symptoms, it allows the monitoring of the disease in its early stages, which can facilitate early diagnosis and pre-clinical treatment. Despite the presymptomatic elevation of NFs, it is argued that the release of NFs is the end product of the neurodegenerative cascade [<xref rid=""B324-ijms-25-10900"" ref-type=""bibr"">324</xref>] and may, therefore, reflect a point of irreversible axonal injury. However, apart from mutation biomarkers, no other biomarker has been documented to have been altered prior to the emergence of symptoms. Additionally, NfL can be measured in serum using a variety of techniques, including ELISA and Simoa. Before NfL can be introduced to the clinic, future large-scale prospective studies are needed to establish cutoff points for ALS phenotypes as well as controls specific to the measurement technique. It is hypothesized that the release of NfL is correlated with the UMN burden. However, to establish a clear NfL connection to either UMN degeneration or LMN degeneration, the development of specific assays targeting α-internexin or peripherin may be required to reflect NfL levels related to either degeneration of UMNs or LMNs, respectively [<xref rid=""B325-ijms-25-10900"" ref-type=""bibr"">325</xref>]. In addition to NfL, a panel of biomarkers may be used to better reflect the heterogeneous pathophysiology of ALS. TDP-43’s key role in ALS pathogenesis is well supported by literature, yet its status as an ALS biomarker is debatable. Reports of limitations of the TDP-43 immunoassays undervalue the TDP-43 centric approach in search of a specific biomarker. Still, plasma TDP-43 had prognostic and diagnostic potential against controls, though not including disease mimics. Despite the seemingly central role of aberrant RNA processing in ALS pathogenesis, there is sparse homogeneity in the reported differentially expressed miRNAs apart from miR-206, which has been identified by several studies despite its lack of specificity or correlation with disease progression. Research on aberrant RNA processing will likely expand in light of the discovery of circulating non-miRNA ncRNA [<xref rid=""B281-ijms-25-10900"" ref-type=""bibr"">281</xref>].",N/A,10 10 2024
"Sleep Apnea and Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis: Cause, Correlation, Any Relation?","Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a motor neuron disease with progressive neurodegeneration, affecting both the cortical and the spinal component of the motor neuron circuitry in patients. The cellular and molecular basis of selective neuronal vulnerability is beginning to emerge. Yet, there are no effective cures for ALS, which affects more than 200,000 people worldwide each year. Recent studies highlight the importance of the glymphatic system and its proper function for the clearance of the cerebral spinal fluid, which is achieved mostly during the sleep period. Therefore, a potential link between problems with sleep and neurodegenerative diseases has been postulated. This paper discusses the present understanding of this potential correlation.","Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a complex and a rare neurodegenerative disease, affecting a heterogeneous patient population and developing with many different underlying causes [<xref rid=""B1-brainsci-14-00978"" ref-type=""bibr"">1</xref>,<xref rid=""B2-brainsci-14-00978"" ref-type=""bibr"">2</xref>]. Patients share many common clinical manifestations, as described by the loss of both upper and lower motor neurons and limitations in the motor neuron circuitry. Most patients sporadically develop the disease without a genetic linkage, suggesting the presence of some common underlying problems that are broadly shared. For example, exposure to toxins prior to ALS diagnosis was considered as one of the potential contributors [<xref rid=""B3-brainsci-14-00978"" ref-type=""bibr"">3</xref>]. Likewise, previous injury to the brain, concussions, and traumatic brain injury were also suggested as potential early underpinnings of the progressive neurodegeneration that follows ALS diagnosis [<xref rid=""B4-brainsci-14-00978"" ref-type=""bibr"">4</xref>,<xref rid=""B5-brainsci-14-00978"" ref-type=""bibr"">5</xref>]. Recent evidence has highlighted problems with sleep and a dysfunctional glymphatic system as potential contributors to disease pathology. Sleep is a complex phenomenon. Problems with sleep are estimated to occur in about 17–25% of the population in the United States [<xref rid=""B6-brainsci-14-00978"" ref-type=""bibr"">6</xref>]. In obstructive sleep apnea, which is one of the most common and severe forms of sleep problems, the upper airways collapse during sleep and the rhythm-generating neurons in the brainstem cannot send proper signals to the muscles that are important for the initiation and the rhythmic maintenance of beathing patterns. This drives the brain and the body towards a dangerous hypoxic state. This intermittent hypoxia is one of the underlying causes of major health problems involving cardiovascular, metabolomic, and neuronal dysfunctions. The “sleep and awake” cycle is precisely orchestrated, mostly by dopaminergic and non-dopaminergic neuromodulation, such as serotoninergic and noradrenergic neuromodulation. Several neurotransmitters are involved in establishing and maintaining this control. The main neurotransmitters are GABA for inhibitory neurons and circuitries and glutamate for excitatory neurons and circuitries. The thalamocortical rhythms important to sleep are regulated by GABAergic neurons [<xref rid=""B7-brainsci-14-00978"" ref-type=""bibr"">7</xref>]. Interestingly, the brain regions that are important for the initiation and regulation of sleep are also the regions that are associated with numerous neurodegenerative diseases. For example, the Lewy body pathology is detected in the midbrain, medulla oblongata, basal forebrain, and neocortex of patients, which are the key regions for the proper control of the “sleep and awake” switch [<xref rid=""B7-brainsci-14-00978"" ref-type=""bibr"">7</xref>]. Glutamate is important as an excitatory neurotransmitter, but when it is not properly cleared from the synaptic cleft, it leads to hyperexcitation and can act as a neurotoxin. Glutamate disturbance is also detected in the presence of sleep apnea [<xref rid=""B8-brainsci-14-00978"" ref-type=""bibr"">8</xref>,<xref rid=""B9-brainsci-14-00978"" ref-type=""bibr"">9</xref>], and the concentrations of glutamate in the plasma of ALS patients have been associated with obstructive sleep apnea [<xref rid=""B10-brainsci-14-00978"" ref-type=""bibr"">10</xref>]. These are interesting findings lay the foundation for a potential link between glutamate toxicity in patients and sleep defects. In fact, riluzole, the first FDA approved drug for ALS, acts on the glutamate clearance system and reduces glutamate toxicity to treat ALS [<xref rid=""B11-brainsci-14-00978"" ref-type=""bibr"">11</xref>]. Different from glutamate, the association of GABA with sleep apnea has also shown a genetic component in that the Phe658Phe polymorphisms in the GABA<sub>B</sub> receptor 1 gene (<italic toggle=""yes"">GABABR1</italic>) have been associated with the occurrence of obstructive sleep apnea in patients [<xref rid=""B12-brainsci-14-00978"" ref-type=""bibr"">12</xref>]. Therefore, the association between sleep problems and the dysregulation of the neurotransmitter system is of great interest. The glymphatic system, -the lymphatic system of the central nervous system-, is comprised of a network of perivascular channels through which CSF mixes with the interstitial fluid (ISF) and drains the metabolic waste out of the brain via meningeal and lymphatic vessels, enabling clearance and refreshment of the brain. The meninges, which cover the cerebral cortex, have lymphatic drainage even though the brain itself is devoid of it [<xref rid=""B13-brainsci-14-00978"" ref-type=""bibr"">13</xref>]. CSF is secreted by choroid plexus, and travels from ventricles of the brain to the subarachnoid space. It enters brain parenchyma, mixes with ISF and flows into the perivenous spaces, exiting via the meningeal lymphatic vessels. This dynamic flow of CSF and ISF clears the metabolites, impurities, aggregates, and cellular toxins [<xref rid=""B14-brainsci-14-00978"" ref-type=""bibr"">14</xref>]. Interestingly, this clearance system is most effective during sleep [<xref rid=""B7-brainsci-14-00978"" ref-type=""bibr"">7</xref>,<xref rid=""B13-brainsci-14-00978"" ref-type=""bibr"">13</xref>]. Since our brains are sustained in CSF, cellular byproducts secreted by neurons and non-neuronal cells of the brain accumulate in CSF, requiring timely and proper clearance. When this process is disrupted, harmful solutes as well as proteins that eventually lead to larger aggregates and protein accumulations are not properly cleared, the pH of the solution shifts to more a non-neutral value, and the brain is put under a stressful condition [<xref rid=""B7-brainsci-14-00978"" ref-type=""bibr"">7</xref>,<xref rid=""B13-brainsci-14-00978"" ref-type=""bibr"">13</xref>,<xref rid=""B14-brainsci-14-00978"" ref-type=""bibr"">14</xref>]. Protein accumulation is emerging as one of the most common problems in neurodegeneration. Even though different proteins accumulate in different diseases, the problem of protein accumulation is shared among many different diseases. For example, there is amyloid-beta (Aβ) accumulation in the brains of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) patients, and tau as well as α-synuclein accumulations are detected in the brains of Parkinson’s disease (PD) patients [<xref rid=""B15-brainsci-14-00978"" ref-type=""bibr"">15</xref>]. TDP-43 pathology, which is initially defined by the accumulation of phosphorylated TDP-43 protein in the cytoplasm of vulnerable neurons, is broadly observed in the brains of patients diagnosed with ALS, FTD (frontotemporal dementia), ALS/FTD, AD, and many others [<xref rid=""B16-brainsci-14-00978"" ref-type=""bibr"">16</xref>,<xref rid=""B17-brainsci-14-00978"" ref-type=""bibr"">17</xref>,<xref rid=""B18-brainsci-14-00978"" ref-type=""bibr"">18</xref>,<xref rid=""B19-brainsci-14-00978"" ref-type=""bibr"">19</xref>,<xref rid=""B20-brainsci-14-00978"" ref-type=""bibr"">20</xref>,<xref rid=""B21-brainsci-14-00978"" ref-type=""bibr"">21</xref>]. Interestingly, TDP-43 pathology is mostly detected in patients who sporadically develop the diseases without a known mutation, suggesting that the protein accumulation problem cannot only be explained by a gene mutation, but, rather, is the result of a more systemic problem [<xref rid=""B17-brainsci-14-00978"" ref-type=""bibr"">17</xref>,<xref rid=""B18-brainsci-14-00978"" ref-type=""bibr"">18</xref>,<xref rid=""B19-brainsci-14-00978"" ref-type=""bibr"">19</xref>,<xref rid=""B20-brainsci-14-00978"" ref-type=""bibr"">20</xref>,<xref rid=""B21-brainsci-14-00978"" ref-type=""bibr"">21</xref>]. Recent evidence begins to suggest that defects with the glymphatic system may be the common culprit and that the inability to clean and clear the unwanted and the toxic content of the CSF may contribute to the protein aggregations detected in the brains of patients. How problems with the glymphatic system relates to ALS pathology has been described in a recent review, which explains the importance and the relevance of glymphatic system for maintaining neuronal health and function [<xref rid=""B22-brainsci-14-00978"" ref-type=""bibr"">22</xref>]. Neurons work with high efficiency, constantly producing metabolic and cellular waste which is secreted via different mechanisms. The amount of waste generated by the neurons and non-neuronal cells of the brain, is reported to be about 7 grams per day [<xref rid=""B23-brainsci-14-00978"" ref-type=""bibr"">23</xref>]. This waste becomes present in the CSF, which is produced and secreted mostly by choroid plexi and other extra-choroidal sites and is a clear, colorless liquid occupying the ventricular system, the subarachnoid space, and the perivascular spaces in the CNS. It is suggested that about 650 ml of CSF is produced per day, mostly after midnight [<xref rid=""B24-brainsci-14-00978"" ref-type=""bibr"">24</xref>]. Since the total volume of CSF remains constant, about 650 ml of CSF must be cleared through the glymphatic system each day, which is an arduous task. CSF is absorbed via the subarachnoid space through the lymph system, the meningeal lymphatics embedded in the dura matter in the brain, and in the spinal arachnoid granulations and spinal meningeal lymphatics in the spinal cord. The dynamics of CSF flow are tightly regulated and are modulated by motions generated by cardiac-driven forces and the respiratory forces. Therefore, our heartbeat and breathing pattern have a direct impact on CSF flow and clearance [<xref rid=""B7-brainsci-14-00978"" ref-type=""bibr"">7</xref>,<xref rid=""B13-brainsci-14-00978"" ref-type=""bibr"">13</xref>,<xref rid=""B23-brainsci-14-00978"" ref-type=""bibr"">23</xref>]. Interestingly, most of CSF clearance occurs while we are asleep, at the time when the heartbeat and breathing patterns are most synchronized [<xref rid=""B23-brainsci-14-00978"" ref-type=""bibr"">23</xref>]. During sleep, the interstitial space is enlarged by 60% and the flow of ISF and CSF is significantly increased, as shown by two-photon imaging in mice [<xref rid=""B25-brainsci-14-00978"" ref-type=""bibr"">25</xref>]. Similarly, studies in humans have also revealed larger CSF volumes during sleep [<xref rid=""B26-brainsci-14-00978"" ref-type=""bibr"">26</xref>], and that studies with 25 independent subjects reported a faster CSF clearance rate during sleep rather than in an awake state [<xref rid=""B27-brainsci-14-00978"" ref-type=""bibr"">27</xref>]. There was effective amyloid beta (Aβ) clearance from the brain of sleeping mice twice more rapidly when compared to awake mice [<xref rid=""B25-brainsci-14-00978"" ref-type=""bibr"">25</xref>], and sleep-deprived mice displayed significant defects in their glymphatic function [<xref rid=""B28-brainsci-14-00978"" ref-type=""bibr"">28</xref>]. In addition to Aβ, other proteins associated with neurodegeneration, such as α-synuclein, and apolipoprotein E, also displayed reduced clearance after sleep deprivation [<xref rid=""B29-brainsci-14-00978"" ref-type=""bibr"">29</xref>,<xref rid=""B30-brainsci-14-00978"" ref-type=""bibr"">30</xref>]. Even in healthy adults, there was accumulation of the protein tau in their plasma after being acutely sleep deprived [<xref rid=""B31-brainsci-14-00978"" ref-type=""bibr"">31</xref>]. When a single-night of sleep was missed, problems with mood, memory, and attention was detected immediately the next day [<xref rid=""B32-brainsci-14-00978"" ref-type=""bibr"">32</xref>]. These findings, both in mouse models and in humans, postulate a key significance and a strong correlation between the quality of sleep, glymphatic network function, and the clearance of proteins that are prone to aggregate [<xref rid=""B33-brainsci-14-00978"" ref-type=""bibr"">33</xref>]. Disturbance in the sleep patterns, such as problems with falling asleep, reduced quality and length, and reduced REM (rapid eye movement) are observed in patients with sleep problems, including patients with obstructive sleep apnea. Sleep problems escalate with age due to the increased stiffness of the cerebral arteries and the reduced amplitude of the cardiac pulse; a significant reduction in glymphatic function is observed [<xref rid=""B34-brainsci-14-00978"" ref-type=""bibr"">34</xref>,<xref rid=""B35-brainsci-14-00978"" ref-type=""bibr"">35</xref>,<xref rid=""B36-brainsci-14-00978"" ref-type=""bibr"">36</xref>]. Therefore, an association between age, sleep problems and reduced effectiveness in the glymphatic system is postulated for many neurodegenerative diseases. About 60% of Parkinson’s disease (PD) patients are reported to have sleep disorders [<xref rid=""B37-brainsci-14-00978"" ref-type=""bibr"">37</xref>] with increasing severity as the disease progresses [<xref rid=""B38-brainsci-14-00978"" ref-type=""bibr"">38</xref>]. In one large population-based study, which included 91,273 patients the association between sleep disorders and the development of PD was assessed for over 10 years. This massive study suggested that insomnia lasting for more than 3 months could indeed be a risk factor for developing PD [<xref rid=""B39-brainsci-14-00978"" ref-type=""bibr"">39</xref>]. A more recent study with 328 patients revealed that poor sleep quality was associated with the more severe PD subtype, and there was higher cognitive decline, apathy, and fatigue in patients [<xref rid=""B40-brainsci-14-00978"" ref-type=""bibr"">40</xref>]. Likewise, sleep apnea was observed with a higher percentage among PD patients, when compared to the general population by 2–14% [<xref rid=""B41-brainsci-14-00978"" ref-type=""bibr"">41</xref>]. On the other hand, other studies have suggested that having PD had exacerbated sleep problems because the dystonia of the airways, which develops due to the disease, had an impact on the severity of sleep apnea. In addition, PD is associated with autonomic dysfunction, which impacts the breathing patterns that become dysfunctional in sleep apnea [<xref rid=""B38-brainsci-14-00978"" ref-type=""bibr"">38</xref>,<xref rid=""B39-brainsci-14-00978"" ref-type=""bibr"">39</xref>,<xref rid=""B40-brainsci-14-00978"" ref-type=""bibr"">40</xref>]. Therefore, the relationship between PD and sleep problems does not appear to be single directional. It is possible that once the vicious cycle is established, it turns into a feed forward loop making both the sleep problem and PD pathology much worse over time. One of the major and first associations with sleep apnea has been the cognitive decline in patients. Significant memory loss and problems with executive function have been observed, which are supported by neuroanatomical changes, such as gray matter loss, a reduction in the size of hippocampus, and the frontal, parietal, and temporal cortices, areas that are associated with AD and FTD [<xref rid=""B30-brainsci-14-00978"" ref-type=""bibr"">30</xref>,<xref rid=""B31-brainsci-14-00978"" ref-type=""bibr"">31</xref>,<xref rid=""B32-brainsci-14-00978"" ref-type=""bibr"">32</xref>]. When rats were exposed to extensive cycles of intermittent hypoxia, as in the case of patients with sleep apnea, there was neuronal apoptosis in the cortical and hippocampal neurons, which was correlated with problems with cognitive and spatial learning [<xref rid=""B42-brainsci-14-00978"" ref-type=""bibr"">42</xref>]. This study generated much interest in the field for connecting the hypoxia that occurs due to sleep apnea with AD. Other studies using different animal models followed with similar results [<xref rid=""B43-brainsci-14-00978"" ref-type=""bibr"">43</xref>], suggesting that the results were not restricted to one species, but, rather, that the correlation between brain hypoxia and neurodegeneration was very significant. Interestingly, about half of AD patients were reported to experience sleep apnea [<xref rid=""B44-brainsci-14-00978"" ref-type=""bibr"">44</xref>]. When sleep apnea was treated in a small subset of AD patients, their cognitive scores improved [<xref rid=""B45-brainsci-14-00978"" ref-type=""bibr"">45</xref>]. Studies with rats and mice revealed that when these animal models were exposed to chronic intermittent hypoxia, there was β-amyloid accumulation detected especially in their hippocampus [<xref rid=""B46-brainsci-14-00978"" ref-type=""bibr"">46</xref>,<xref rid=""B47-brainsci-14-00978"" ref-type=""bibr"">47</xref>], as well as tau hyperphosphorylation [<xref rid=""B48-brainsci-14-00978"" ref-type=""bibr"">48</xref>,<xref rid=""B49-brainsci-14-00978"" ref-type=""bibr"">49</xref>]. Moreover, like patients with severe sleep apnea displaying hippocampal atrophy, rats with disturbed sleep patterns showed a reduction in neuronal arborization, as well as a reduction in the volume of the hippocampus and brainstem respiratory nuclei, together with other brain regions that are linked to cognitive function [<xref rid=""B50-brainsci-14-00978"" ref-type=""bibr"">50</xref>]. Studies emerging from both human studies and animal models revealed that Aβ clearance occurs mostly during sleep and the disruption of sleep leads to increased levels of Aβ in the brain [<xref rid=""B51-brainsci-14-00978"" ref-type=""bibr"">51</xref>]. In line with previous findings, when 3XTg AD mice were exposed to intermittent hypoxia, as in the case of sleep apnea, there was increased Aβ amyloid production [<xref rid=""B47-brainsci-14-00978"" ref-type=""bibr"">47</xref>]. These are very interesting findings, laying a framework for our understanding of the association between sleep apnea and protein accumulation in the brains of AD patients. Sleep problems are also closely linked to ALS [<xref rid=""B52-brainsci-14-00978"" ref-type=""bibr"">52</xref>] and ALS/FTD [<xref rid=""B53-brainsci-14-00978"" ref-type=""bibr"">53</xref>]. The muscles that are important for respiratory function display progressive weakening and degeneration, leading to numerous problems with breathing. Noninvasive ventilation improves patient outcomes. Sleep apnea was found to be more common in ALS patients when compared to the general population [<xref rid=""B54-brainsci-14-00978"" ref-type=""bibr"">54</xref>]. There were significant reductions in total sleep time, oxygen saturation and overall sleep efficiency in ALS patients [<xref rid=""B55-brainsci-14-00978"" ref-type=""bibr"">55</xref>] and interestingly, the mean survival rate in ALS patients with obstructive sleep apnea was significantly shorter than patients without it, suggesting its contribution to the rate of disease progression [<xref rid=""B56-brainsci-14-00978"" ref-type=""bibr"">56</xref>]. A causal association study between obstructive sleep apnea and ALS, including GWAS (genome-wide association study) data from 16,761 ALS patients and 201,194 healthy controls, revealed a link between ALS and sleep apnea, in that having obstructive sleep apnea increases the risk of developing ALS [<xref rid=""B57-brainsci-14-00978"" ref-type=""bibr"">57</xref>]. TDP-43 pathology is one of the most common proteinopathies in ALS, and studies have shown increased levels of TDP-43 protein in the CSF of ALS patients [<xref rid=""B53-brainsci-14-00978"" ref-type=""bibr"">53</xref>,<xref rid=""B58-brainsci-14-00978"" ref-type=""bibr"">58</xref>], suggesting that it has not been properly cleared, and may indeed be used as a prognostic biomarker [<xref rid=""B58-brainsci-14-00978"" ref-type=""bibr"">58</xref>]. Indeed, the proteins that are present in the CSF have been actively studied for the identification of biomarkers and numerous proteins have been found to be differentially present in the diseased CSF [<xref rid=""B59-brainsci-14-00978"" ref-type=""bibr"">59</xref>]. ALS is a complex disease, and the underlying causes of the disease may differ from patient to patient, although some common themes emerge [<xref rid=""B1-brainsci-14-00978"" ref-type=""bibr"">1</xref>,<xref rid=""B2-brainsci-14-00978"" ref-type=""bibr"">2</xref>]. For example, protein accumulation, glutamate excitotoxicity and neuroinflammation are some of the common causes of the disease [<xref rid=""B1-brainsci-14-00978"" ref-type=""bibr"">1</xref>,<xref rid=""B2-brainsci-14-00978"" ref-type=""bibr"">2</xref>,<xref rid=""B18-brainsci-14-00978"" ref-type=""bibr"">18</xref>,<xref rid=""B21-brainsci-14-00978"" ref-type=""bibr"">21</xref>], which are now strongly linked to defects with the glymphatic system-mediated CSF clearance that occurs mostly during sleep [<xref rid=""B22-brainsci-14-00978"" ref-type=""bibr"">22</xref>]. In addition to these previously reported common pathologies, there is one more cellular problem that occurs very early in the diseased motor neurons of ALS, and that is detected both in the familial and sporadic cases: the loss of dendritic spines. One of the first signs of neuronal vulnerability is the loss of spines. Spines are the sites of neuronal connection and are found to be very dynamic even in the adult brain [<xref rid=""B60-brainsci-14-00978"" ref-type=""bibr"">60</xref>,<xref rid=""B61-brainsci-14-00978"" ref-type=""bibr"">61</xref>,<xref rid=""B62-brainsci-14-00978"" ref-type=""bibr"">62</xref>,<xref rid=""B63-brainsci-14-00978"" ref-type=""bibr"">63</xref>,<xref rid=""B64-brainsci-14-00978"" ref-type=""bibr"">64</xref>]. Spines constantly change their morphology and structure, and they undergo repair and pruning, which is more evident in the developing brain, but it is present throughout life [<xref rid=""B62-brainsci-14-00978"" ref-type=""bibr"">62</xref>,<xref rid=""B64-brainsci-14-00978"" ref-type=""bibr"">64</xref>]. Spines and their modulation are exceptionally important for the development and maturation of the motor neurons and the motor neuron circuitry [<xref rid=""B65-brainsci-14-00978"" ref-type=""bibr"">65</xref>]. Numerous studies emerging from the Bellingham laboratory elegantly reveal the dynamic nature of spines and how they are affected early in the disease, especially within the context of ALS with TDP-43 pathology [<xref rid=""B66-brainsci-14-00978"" ref-type=""bibr"">66</xref>,<xref rid=""B67-brainsci-14-00978"" ref-type=""bibr"">67</xref>,<xref rid=""B68-brainsci-14-00978"" ref-type=""bibr"">68</xref>]. Studies utilizing post-mortem human samples isolated from the middle frontal gyrus of FTD patients with TDP-43 pathology revealed significant reduction in the levels of synaptophysin, a presynaptic protein by Western blot analyses. However, there was an increase in the levels of microglia that harbored postsynaptic density protein 95 (PSD95), suggesting an upregulation in the microglial clearance of spines in FTD cases, and an abnormal synaptic pruning when compared to the controls [<xref rid=""B69-brainsci-14-00978"" ref-type=""bibr"">69</xref>]. This spine pruning has been associated with the signals that become present in the spines that needs to be removed [<xref rid=""B70-brainsci-14-00978"" ref-type=""bibr"">70</xref>,<xref rid=""B71-brainsci-14-00978"" ref-type=""bibr"">71</xref>], and the microglial phagocytosis is required to recognize and eliminate the spine [<xref rid=""B72-brainsci-14-00978"" ref-type=""bibr"">72</xref>]. Therefore, spine maintenance has a neuroimmune component [<xref rid=""B70-brainsci-14-00978"" ref-type=""bibr"">70</xref>,<xref rid=""B71-brainsci-14-00978"" ref-type=""bibr"">71</xref>,<xref rid=""B72-brainsci-14-00978"" ref-type=""bibr"">72</xref>]. The cellular and molecular mechanism of this very precise spine clearance has led to the discovery of the “eat me” and “do not eat me” signals, which determine whether spines will be phagocytosed or not [<xref rid=""B71-brainsci-14-00978"" ref-type=""bibr"">71</xref>,<xref rid=""B72-brainsci-14-00978"" ref-type=""bibr"">72</xref>]. For example, the complement proteins C1q and C3 become localized to the tips of the spines that will be recognized and cleared by the microglia, which express the microglia-specific C3 receptor. Similar to the C3 receptor, the TREM2+ microglia also engulf synaptic proteins and the spines. Interestingly mutations in the <italic toggle=""yes"">TREM2</italic> gene are considered to be a risk factor for ALS [<xref rid=""B73-brainsci-14-00978"" ref-type=""bibr"">73</xref>] and ALS/FTD [<xref rid=""B74-brainsci-14-00978"" ref-type=""bibr"">74</xref>]. The topic of “eat me signals” and how they manifest clearance has been extensively reviewed and is now accepted one of the best orchestrated events to maintain synaptic structures, integrity and function [<xref rid=""B71-brainsci-14-00978"" ref-type=""bibr"">71</xref>,<xref rid=""B75-brainsci-14-00978"" ref-type=""bibr"">75</xref>,<xref rid=""B76-brainsci-14-00978"" ref-type=""bibr"">76</xref>,<xref rid=""B77-brainsci-14-00978"" ref-type=""bibr"">77</xref>]. Remodeling of spines to maintaining their health and function represents is an important quest. Spines come in many different forms and shapes and with many different functions. The spines that mediate excitatory and inhibitory synapses are structurally different and their location within the membrane of the soma, axon and apical dendrite may also vary. Therefore, the pruning and remodeling of spines are more complicated than expected. However, this constantly occurs in a healthy brain. Recent studies have begun to show the importance of sleep during this process. For example, two-photon live imaging revealed that dendritic spines were removed at a much faster rate during sleep in adolescent mice [<xref rid=""B78-brainsci-14-00978"" ref-type=""bibr"">78</xref>]. Spines bear the pressure of maintaining connections between neurons and they need to be mostly active while we are awake, but during sleep their strength is reduced, and, in particular, the strength of the spines located in excitatory neurons decrease. This is a required process to maintain their health and overall stability. When the awake cycle is extended, synaptic potentiation becomes difficult to maintain. In addition, during sleep, the endocytosis of excitatory receptors occurs, facilitating structural changes within the spine. However, disrupted sleep patterns and problems with sleep would not allow proper synaptic renormalization, and this, in turn, would add stress to the neurons, as their spines have not been properly cleared and remodeled [<xref rid=""B79-brainsci-14-00978"" ref-type=""bibr"">79</xref>]. Thus, sleep emerges as an important period for spine pruning and remodeling, which is ultimately important for the stability of neuronal connections and the health of the nervous system. Recent studies with mouse models have shown that sleep deprivation has a significant impact on the density of dendritic spines in the hippocampus [<xref rid=""B78-brainsci-14-00978"" ref-type=""bibr"">78</xref>,<xref rid=""B79-brainsci-14-00978"" ref-type=""bibr"">79</xref>,<xref rid=""B80-brainsci-14-00978"" ref-type=""bibr"">80</xref>]. Similar defects could be present in other regions of the brain, but it is mostly the hippocampus that has been investigated in these studies [<xref rid=""B80-brainsci-14-00978"" ref-type=""bibr"">80</xref>]. In one study, 72 h of sleep deprivation resulted in a reduction of microglia-mediated spine elimination, leading to excessive but unhealthy spines and abnormal neuronal activity in the hippocampus [<xref rid=""B81-brainsci-14-00978"" ref-type=""bibr"">81</xref>]. In both adolescent and adult mice, the short-term memory was impaired, and there were increased excitatory synapses in the granule cells of the dentate gyrus in adolescent mice. One of the most detailed studies on the types of spines that are primarily affected due to a lack of sleep was a study that induced only 5 hours of sleep deprivation in mice and found a significant decrease in select types of spines and in distinct regions of the hippocampus [<xref rid=""B82-brainsci-14-00978"" ref-type=""bibr"">82</xref>], suggesting that even acute sleep deprivation has an impact on individual spine types, and local effects on the structural plasticity of neuronal connections. These studies were eye-opening in the field, revealing the importance and the impact of sleep deprivation, albeit when it is short-term [<xref rid=""B82-brainsci-14-00978"" ref-type=""bibr"">82</xref>]. In these studies, the focus had been on the hippocampal region of the brain, so it is unclear whether other regions of the brain, such as the frontal cortex or the motor cortex display similar problems. The cerebellum is very plastic, with Purkinje cells which are adorned extensively with excitatory parallel fiber synapses, such that a single Purkinje neuron receives about a 175,000 parallel fiber input [<xref rid=""B83-brainsci-14-00978"" ref-type=""bibr"">83</xref>]. Therefore, it is of great interest to understand whether sleep also has an impact in the cerebellum and the remodeling of the Purkinje cell and their connections. A recent study explored this topic via a 3D reconstructive analysis of more than 7000 spines in the posterior vermis of mice whose sleep was perturbed. Very elegant and detailed studies, both at the level of electrophysiological recordings and the resolution of images, revealed that sleep deprivation also has an impact on the stability and the integrity of spines in the cerebellum, such that during the awake cycle, parallel fibers fire and form connections and sleep is required to prune the synapses that are formed because of coincidence and are destined to be removed [<xref rid=""B84-brainsci-14-00978"" ref-type=""bibr"">84</xref>]. Failure in their proper and timely removal may have an impact on the overall connectivity and neuronal activity, affecting balance and motor neuron circuitry behavior. One of the most interesting studies on the impact of sleep on the motor cortex was conducted on a 36-year-old man with tetraplegia after a spinal cord injury [<xref rid=""B85-brainsci-14-00978"" ref-type=""bibr"">85</xref>]. In this study, 96-channel intracortical microelectrode arrays were placed in his left precentral gyrus, the brain activity was recorded while he learned how to play a new game that required visuo-motor skills, and during his sleep the same day. The study showed that there was a “replay” of the activity in the motor cortex related to the recent visuo-motor skill acquisition and that the related motor cortex areas remained active even during a good sleep [<xref rid=""B85-brainsci-14-00978"" ref-type=""bibr"">85</xref>]. This study was important in demonstrating how dynamic the neuronal activity in the motor cortex is even during sleep and that sleep plays an important role in reinforcing learning behavior for motor function. The dynamics of spine clearance or spine modification could not be investigated in this study, but it revealed the importance of a healthy sleep period for reinforcing the connections formed. The neurons that become vulnerable to degeneration in the motor cortex lose the integrity and the stability of their spines. Neuronal connections depend on the integrity and the health of spines. Neuronal connections depend on the integrity and the health of spines. Especially in the upper motor neurons (UMNs) that degenerate in ALS patients, the spine loss in their apical dendrites, where most neuronal connections are made, was detected as early as P15 (postnatal day 15) in well-characterized mouse models of ALS [<xref rid=""B66-brainsci-14-00978"" ref-type=""bibr"">66</xref>,<xref rid=""B67-brainsci-14-00978"" ref-type=""bibr"">67</xref>]. Apical dendrite degeneration, followed by spine loss, was observed in the UMNs of both the familial and sporadic cases, and this cellular problem was closely recapitulated in the UMNs of numerous mouse models that are developed based on mutations and pathologies detected in patients [<xref rid=""B86-brainsci-14-00978"" ref-type=""bibr"">86</xref>], suggesting that this is observed not only in a limited subtype of patients, but more broadly in sporadic patients who develop the disease due to very many different underlying causes. These findings are important for two reasons: first, they show that spine loss, especially in the neurons that degenerate in ALS, is an early event, which occurs prior to symptom onset, and second, they show that, regardless of species, similar neuronal problems are observed in the neurons that become diseased and that progressively degenerate. Recent studies have also shown a direct link between sleep deprivation and spine loss, especially a reduction in the density of thin, mushroom, and filopodia-like spine density in the CA1 region of the hippocampus [<xref rid=""B82-brainsci-14-00978"" ref-type=""bibr"">82</xref>]. The suggestion that problems with sleep may indeed contribute to disease pathology in ALS would not be a far-fetched idea. However, one needs to be careful when stating cause or correlation, especially there is an intricate balance affecting both. For example, as the disease progresses, patients develop weakening of the diaphragm muscles and that they may require ventilation for proper breathing. Sleep problems may be exacerbated with disease progression, and increased sleep problems may facilitate disease pathology, generating a vicious feed-forward loop, potentially expediting the rate of disease progression in patients. In fact, it has been shown that patients who develop disease pathology at a much faster rate have problems with sleep in a significantly higher ratio when compared to patients who develop the disease with a much slower pace [<xref rid=""B52-brainsci-14-00978"" ref-type=""bibr"">52</xref>,<xref rid=""B55-brainsci-14-00978"" ref-type=""bibr"">55</xref>,<xref rid=""B57-brainsci-14-00978"" ref-type=""bibr"">57</xref>]. Taking care of ventilation problems in ALS patients early in the disease increases the quality of life and is suggested to increase survival rates in patients. Sleep now emerges as the prime time for the brain to replenish, repair and prepare for the next day. Problems with sleep lead to the accumulation of many problems, and one of which is the brain’s lack of ability to maintain a healthy balance of spine integrity, health, and stability. When the brain is not able to remodel, remove, and enforce select spines in distinct regions of the brain, this leads to severe problems in hyperexcitability, hypoexcitability and an overall problem with neuronal connectivity. Therefore, when patients lose a good night’s sleep, or, worse, if they have sleep apnea and are subjected to prolonged sleep problems, it becomes harder for the brain to maintain homeostasis. In such cases, they are exposed to severe hypoxic conditions, their CSF cannot be properly cleaned, and problems with neuronal connectivity begin to occur. Thus, it is no surprise that problems with sleep have been linked to neurodegeneration. Evidence obtained both from different disease models and from studies with patients lays a strong foundation for an important link between sleep problems and ALS. It is possible that problems with sleep, when combined with other underlying causes, may tip the balance towards the cascade of events that leads to neurodegeneration. In such cases, it is possible that the disease could have developed even in the absence of sleep problems, but potentially at a later point. Therefore, it is not possible to propose that sleep problems are the “cause” of the disease, even though they may contribute to the pathology. Once the disease-causing cascade of events is initiated, it also further exacerbates sleep problems due to the weakening of muscles, altering sleep patterns, and making the blood vessels rigid or leaky, which in turn further enhances disease-related pathologies and clinical outcomes. This may lead to the argument that sleep problems become significant because of disease progression. Therefore, there is no one simple explanation for the cause and the correlation of sleep apnea and ALS, but the strong association between the two requires further investigations among ALS patient populations. Discoveries that emerge both using different model systems and data obtained from healthy controls and patients unequivocally establish the importance of sleep for maintaining the health and the stability of the nervous system, especially the cerebral cortex. Problems with sleep lead to many different problems, which are characterized as the culprit for the development of many neurodegenerative diseases. Since these discoveries are rather recent, we do not have strong evidence to declare whether the relationship is causal or correlative. Currently, ALS patients are not routinely monitored for their sleep problems at the time of diagnosis or questioned on their sleep problems prior to diagnosis. Most epidemiology studies do not have the sleep component investigated together with other parameters that question genetic and environmental factors. We suggest a more through and more detailed studies are required to assess the impact of sleep problems on the initiation and the rate of disease progression in ALS. This may help in clinical trial design and in the development of inclusion and exclusion criteria and may even be utilized as a potential pharmacokinetic biomarker to investigate the timing and the extent, as well as the rate, of disease progression, especially in sporadic cases of ALS affected with sleep problems. The association between sleep problems and ALS pathogenesis may also help in the identification of prognostic, diagnostic, and, most importantly, predictive and pharmacokinetic biomarkers. Detailed proteomic, metabolomic and lipidomic investigations of CSF isolated from ALS patients with and without sleep problems at different stages of their disease, would help reveal the presence of key biomolecules that are linked to, or correlated with, disease pathology. The prognostic biomarkers could be important for early detection and to address whether a patient will develop ALS; the diagnostic biomarker could help reveal the most relevant underlying causes of the disease for, and the pharmacokinetic biomarkers could indicate about the timing and the extent of degeneration. Developing strategies to avoid apnea and other sleep problems may also be considered as a potential treatment strategy to help the body and the brain to come out of the potential vicious cycle that exacerbates the rate of disease progression. This may be especially important for patients who develop the disease due to problems with hypoxia, neuroinflammation, protein aggregation and defects with neuronal connectivity. Moving forward, we propose to consider problems with sleep as one of the potential disease-related factors in ALS and incorporate sleep studies in ALS clinics and in our efforts to develop effective treatment strategies for patients.",N/A,27 9 2024
An Effective DNA Methylation Biomarker Screening Mechanism for Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) Based on Comorbidities and Gene Function Analysis,"This study used epigenomic methylation differential expression analysis to identify primary biomarkers in patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). We combined electronic medical record datasets from MIMIC-IV (United States) and NHIRD (Taiwan) to explore ALS comorbidities in depth and discover any comorbidity-related biomarkers. We also applied word2vec to these two clinical diagnostic medical databases to measure similarities between ALS and other similar diseases and evaluated the statistical assessment of the odds ratio to discover significant comorbidities for ALS subjects. Important and representative DNA methylation biomarker candidates could be effectively selected by cross-comparing similar diseases to ALS, comorbidity-related genes, and differentially expressed methylation loci for ALS subjects. The screened epigenomic and comorbidity-related biomarkers were clustered based on their genetic functions. The candidate DNA methylation biomarkers associated with ALS were comprehensively discovered. Gene ontology annotations were then applied to analyze and cluster the candidate biomarkers into three different groups based on gene function annotations. The results showed that a potential testing kit for ALS detection can be composed of <italic toggle=""yes"">SOD3</italic>, <italic toggle=""yes"">CACNA1H</italic>, and <italic toggle=""yes"">ERBB4</italic> for effective early screening of ALS using blood samples. By developing an effective DNA methylation biomarker screening mechanism, early detection and prophylactic treatment of high-risk ALS patients can be achieved.","Neurodegenerative diseases refer to hereditary or sporadic conditions characterized by the gradual and progressive loss of neuronal structure or function, including neuronal death. Neurodegenerative disorders, such as Alzheimer’s disease (AD), Parkinson’s disease (PD), and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), also known as Lou Gehrig’s disease, affect millions of people around the world [<xref rid=""B1-bioengineering-11-01020"" ref-type=""bibr"">1</xref>]. Unfortunately, the pathogenesis of these chronic neurodegenerative diseases is not fully understood, and current treatments do not stop or slow down the progression of these pathological conditions. ALS is an adult-onset neurological disorder. Patients experience progressive degeneration of motor neurons in the spinal cord, brainstem, and cortex, leading to general paralysis, respiratory failure, and death. Clinically, patients can present with bulbar onset (25%), limb onset (70%), or trunk/respiratory onset (5%), followed by subsequent spread to adjacent regions. Based on where the onset is characterized (for example, spinal or bulbar), patients may survive for 2–10 years [<xref rid=""B2-bioengineering-11-01020"" ref-type=""bibr"">2</xref>,<xref rid=""B3-bioengineering-11-01020"" ref-type=""bibr"">3</xref>,<xref rid=""B4-bioengineering-11-01020"" ref-type=""bibr"">4</xref>]. Early detection of the onset of neurodegeneration is crucial, as it can provide an opportunity for early treatment that may help prevent further progression of the disease. Neuropathology is currently considered the gold standard for diagnosing the presence and progression of neurodegenerative diseases. However, this is usually based on an autopsy performed after the death of a patient. Therefore, medical researchers are searching for an effective, non-invasive diagnostic method that can be employed for the early detection of neurodegeneration. The diagnosis of ALS is primarily based on symptoms, clinical examinations, and a series of tests to rule out other diseases. Owing to the complexity of the neurons behind observable or describable symptoms, it typically takes 9–15 months to diagnose ALS from the time when medical attention is required. Recent studies have shown that genetics can be widely used to study neurodegeneration. Several potential biomarkers (<italic toggle=""yes"">SOD1</italic>, <italic toggle=""yes"">DAO</italic>, <italic toggle=""yes"">C9orf72</italic>, <italic toggle=""yes"">TARDBP</italic>, <italic toggle=""yes"">FUS</italic>, <italic toggle=""yes"">SETX</italic>, <italic toggle=""yes"">ANG</italic>, <italic toggle=""yes"">HNRNPA1</italic>, <italic toggle=""yes"">ALS2</italic>, <italic toggle=""yes"">VAPB</italic>, <italic toggle=""yes"">FIG4</italic>, <italic toggle=""yes"">OPTN</italic>, <italic toggle=""yes"">UBQLN2</italic>, <italic toggle=""yes"">VCP</italic>, <italic toggle=""yes"">MAPT</italic>, <italic toggle=""yes"">PFN1</italic>) have been reported for the diagnosis of ALS, using either genetic or proteomic approaches [<xref rid=""B5-bioengineering-11-01020"" ref-type=""bibr"">5</xref>,<xref rid=""B6-bioengineering-11-01020"" ref-type=""bibr"">6</xref>,<xref rid=""B7-bioengineering-11-01020"" ref-type=""bibr"">7</xref>,<xref rid=""B8-bioengineering-11-01020"" ref-type=""bibr"">8</xref>,<xref rid=""B9-bioengineering-11-01020"" ref-type=""bibr"">9</xref>]; however, none of these markers are robust enough to be applied in clinical practice. Currently, there is a lack of ALS biomarkers that can effectively assist in the diagnosis and detection of ALS. Although many discoveries have been made in ALS research over the past two decades, the clinical pathogenesis of ALS remains unclear. In general, approximately 5–10% of ALS cases are familial ALS (fALS) and the remaining 90% are sporadic ALS (sALS) [<xref rid=""B10-bioengineering-11-01020"" ref-type=""bibr"">10</xref>]. Although the heritability of neurodegenerative diseases is 40–80% [<xref rid=""B11-bioengineering-11-01020"" ref-type=""bibr"">11</xref>,<xref rid=""B12-bioengineering-11-01020"" ref-type=""bibr"">12</xref>,<xref rid=""B13-bioengineering-11-01020"" ref-type=""bibr"">13</xref>,<xref rid=""B14-bioengineering-11-01020"" ref-type=""bibr"">14</xref>], a significant fraction of the variance is non-hereditary, and there is strong evidence that environmental exposure is an important contributor to the disease pathogenesis [<xref rid=""B15-bioengineering-11-01020"" ref-type=""bibr"">15</xref>]. Thus, the etiology of ALS is complex and involves both genetic and environmental factors. However, the specific molecular mechanisms underlying its pathogenesis remain poorly understood. The identification of epigenetic modifications associated with ALS may provide insights into the disease’s etiology. Epigenetics is the study of gene expression or cell function through certain mechanisms or pathways without altering DNA sequences [<xref rid=""B16-bioengineering-11-01020"" ref-type=""bibr"">16</xref>], including DNA methylation, histone modification, nucleosome repositioning, and post-transcriptional regulation by micro-RNAs. Such regulatory mechanisms alter the expression of genes that are closely related to the physiological and pathological states of individuals and can contribute to our understanding of human growth and disease development. DNA methylation refers to the addition of a methyl moiety to the cytosine-5 position to form 5-methylcytosines, mostly in genomic regions with high-frequency CpG sites called CpG islands [<xref rid=""B17-bioengineering-11-01020"" ref-type=""bibr"">17</xref>]. In the human genome, approximately 70% of promoter regions contain CpG islands [<xref rid=""B18-bioengineering-11-01020"" ref-type=""bibr"">18</xref>,<xref rid=""B19-bioengineering-11-01020"" ref-type=""bibr"">19</xref>]. Therefore, abnormal genomic methylation may lead to various diseases. Increasing evidence has shown that alterations in DNA methylation can lead to differences in neurodegeneration and other brain diseases. Significant associations have been reported between DNA methylation in the brain/blood and Alzheimer’s disease (AD) [<xref rid=""B20-bioengineering-11-01020"" ref-type=""bibr"">20</xref>,<xref rid=""B21-bioengineering-11-01020"" ref-type=""bibr"">21</xref>,<xref rid=""B22-bioengineering-11-01020"" ref-type=""bibr"">22</xref>,<xref rid=""B23-bioengineering-11-01020"" ref-type=""bibr"">23</xref>], Parkinson’s disease (PD) [<xref rid=""B24-bioengineering-11-01020"" ref-type=""bibr"">24</xref>,<xref rid=""B25-bioengineering-11-01020"" ref-type=""bibr"">25</xref>], and ALS [<xref rid=""B26-bioengineering-11-01020"" ref-type=""bibr"">26</xref>,<xref rid=""B27-bioengineering-11-01020"" ref-type=""bibr"">27</xref>]. Therefore, DNA methylation analysis may help us explore the pathogenesis of ALS and identify appropriate biomarkers, shortening the diagnostic duration to guide subsequent ALS treatments. In this study, we focused on designing a biomarker screening mechanism and identifying effective DNA methylation biomarkers for ALS, in addition to investigating the occurrence and patterns of methylation alterations during ALS progression. We proposed an approach to identify DNA methylation biomarkers, a traditional differential DNA methylation analysis incorporating associated comorbidity patterns and disease–gene associations. Electronic medical record (EMR) data from different medical databases were analyzed for comorbidity patterns in patients with ALS, and disease-specific associated genes were identified from the associated comorbidities. By integrating biomarkers primarily identified by differential DNA methylation analysis and cross-validating secondary significant disease genes from historical EMR comorbidity pattern analysis, we designed and screened effective biomarkers for ALS diagnosis. These results will enable the early detection of highly diverse pathogenic mechanisms in different patients with ALS and may provide effective and appropriate treatments to prolong survival. Here, we proposed an efficient screening mechanism to identify novel biomarkers that can aid in the diagnosis of ALS by combining DNA methylation profiling and comorbidity patterns with gene functional analysis to investigate the phenomena and patterns of methylation during the progression of ALS and gain insights into the etiology of the disease. The processing stages of the entire method are shown in <xref rid=""bioengineering-11-01020-f001"" ref-type=""fig"">Figure 1</xref>, and the details of each step are described in the following sections.  DNA methylation is an important molecular mechanism underlying human diseases. This study aimed to explore an efficient and effective screening mechanism for methylation biomarker selection, particularly for the early detection of ALS through liquid biopsy tests. We identified potential biomarkers for ALS through a comprehensive analysis by investigating blood DNA methylation differences between patients with ALS and healthy controls, and significant comorbid disease genes from two different medical datasets (MIMIC-IV and NHIRD). The epigenetic biomarkers identified by traditional methylation profiling data and comorbidity biomarkers annotated by EMRs may share a common mechanism for further exploration and selection of biomarkers. The results of gene–disease association analysis revealed that “hereditary and idiopathic peripheral neuropathy (ICD-9: 356)”, “nerve root and plexus disorders (ICD-9: 353)”, “aphagia and dysphagia (ICD-10: R13), and “respiratory failure (ICD-10: J96)” were commonly associated with ALS symptoms. In addition, there are reports showing that vocal cord dysfunction is associated with the manifestation of ALS [<xref rid=""B43-bioengineering-11-01020"" ref-type=""bibr"">43</xref>], with symptoms including hoarseness, hypophonia, dry cough at night, episodes of inspiratory stridor, and dyspnea. Dyspnea is a common and well-known symptom in patients with ALS, and stridor is a common symptom of multiple system atrophy that may occasionally occur in other neurodegenerative diseases [<xref rid=""B44-bioengineering-11-01020"" ref-type=""bibr"">44</xref>,<xref rid=""B45-bioengineering-11-01020"" ref-type=""bibr"">45</xref>,<xref rid=""B46-bioengineering-11-01020"" ref-type=""bibr"">46</xref>]. However, vocal cord dysfunction has received little attention in the ALS-related literature. The identified significant comorbid disease genes are considered important secondary biomarkers for subsequent clinical validation. The proposed method identified three functionally representative methylation biomarkers, <italic toggle=""yes"">SOD3</italic>, <italic toggle=""yes"">CACNA1H</italic>, and <italic toggle=""yes"">ERBB4</italic>, which have all been reported to be significantly associated with ALS and may be useful for the early diagnosis and subsequent precision treatment of ALS. Mutations in <italic toggle=""yes"">SOD3</italic> have been linked to several diseases, including familial amyloidotic polyneuropathy type 1, diabetes, and hypertension, and are risk factors for atherosclerosis [<xref rid=""B47-bioengineering-11-01020"" ref-type=""bibr"">47</xref>]. Studies in previous years have also shown that mutations or overexpression of <italic toggle=""yes"">SOD3</italic> may be associated with ALS [<xref rid=""B48-bioengineering-11-01020"" ref-type=""bibr"">48</xref>]. For the second gene, previous studies have found that missense mutations in <italic toggle=""yes"">CACNA1H</italic> produced minor but significant changes in T-type channel activity, consistent with a loss of channel function. This finding indicates that <italic toggle=""yes"">CACNA1H</italic> is a susceptibility gene for ALS [<xref rid=""B49-bioengineering-11-01020"" ref-type=""bibr"">49</xref>,<xref rid=""B50-bioengineering-11-01020"" ref-type=""bibr"">50</xref>]. Additionally, <italic toggle=""yes"">ERBB4</italic> mutations led to reduced autophosphorylation of <italic toggle=""yes"">ERBB4</italic> upon neuregulin-1 (NRG-1) stimulation, resulting in clinically affected individuals with both upper and lower motor neuron involvement and a lack of obvious cognitive dysfunction. This study suggests that disruption of the neuregulin-<italic toggle=""yes"">ERBB4</italic> pathway is involved in ALS pathogenesis [<xref rid=""B51-bioengineering-11-01020"" ref-type=""bibr"">51</xref>]. The publication of these studies provided additional support for our findings. In this study, nine candidate methylation biomarkers were found to apply to clinical databases in different regions using two different cross-referencing approaches. However, one study reported that the clinical characteristics of ALS differ among various ethnic groups [<xref rid=""B52-bioengineering-11-01020"" ref-type=""bibr"">52</xref>]. From the cross-comparison results (shown in <xref rid=""app1-bioengineering-11-01020"" ref-type=""app"">Supplementary Tables S2 and S3</xref>), it can be seen that among the intersecting genes with significant comorbidities, <italic toggle=""yes"">VCL</italic>, <italic toggle=""yes"">RHOBTB2</italic>, <italic toggle=""yes"">ADAMTS1</italic>, and <italic toggle=""yes"">UNC5D</italic> were unique to the NHIRD dataset, whereas <italic toggle=""yes"">ZP3</italic>, <italic toggle=""yes"">DEAF1</italic>, <italic toggle=""yes"">MDN1</italic>, <italic toggle=""yes"">KIF7</italic>, <italic toggle=""yes"">SLC6A3</italic>, <italic toggle=""yes"">ITGAX</italic>, <italic toggle=""yes"">EIF4A3</italic>, <italic toggle=""yes"">RIPK2</italic>, <italic toggle=""yes"">C1R</italic>, <italic toggle=""yes"">SORL1</italic>, <italic toggle=""yes"">SEMA3E</italic>, <italic toggle=""yes"">BHMT</italic>, and <italic toggle=""yes"">DBT</italic> were identified in the United States MIC-IV dataset only. It can be inferred that genetic differences between Asian and USA ALS patients with ALS may contribute to the differences in clinical characteristics among different ethnic groups. In summary, the current unmet medical needs in the ALS market include curative drugs, earlier diagnosis, identification of specific biomarkers associated with ALS, and extended patient survival with improved symptoms. Among these issues, early diagnosis by utilizing appropriate biomarkers is the most important challenge. By comprehensively analyzing the GEO methylation profiling data and EMR databases, we identified a set of significant and representative methylation biomarkers for the detection of ALS. In addition, by combining ALS comorbidity datasets from different racial groups, we identified biomarkers that may be exclusively applicable to different ethnic groups. These new findings provide promising evidence that DNA methylation biomarkers can be used for the early diagnosis of ALS patients.",N/A,12 10 2024
Hydrogen Sulfide Modulates Astrocytic Toxicity in Mouse Spinal Cord Cultures: Implications for Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis,"Hydrogen sulfide (H<sub>2</sub>S), a known inhibitor of the electron transport chain, is endogenously produced in the periphery as well as in the central nervous system, where is mainly generated by glial cells. It affects, as a cellular signaling molecule, many different biochemical processes. In the central nervous system, depending on its concentration, it can be protective or damaging to neurons. In the study, we have demonstrated, in a primary mouse spinal cord cultures, that it is particularly harmful to motor neurons, is produced by glial cells, and is stimulated by inflammation. However, its role on glial cells, especially astrocytes, is still under-investigated. The present study was designed to evaluate the impact of H<sub>2</sub>S on astrocytes and their phenotypic heterogeneity, together with the functionality and homeostasis of mitochondria in primary spinal cord cultures. We found that H<sub>2</sub>S modulates astrocytes’ morphological changes and their phenotypic transformation, exerts toxic properties by decreasing ATP production and the mitochondrial respiration rate, disturbs mitochondrial depolarization, and alters the energetic metabolism. These results further support the hypothesis that H<sub>2</sub>S is a toxic mediator, mainly released by astrocytes, possibly acting as an autocrine factor toward astrocytes, and probably involved in the non-cell autonomous mechanisms leading to motor neuron death.","Hydrogen sulfide (H<sub>2</sub>S) is a small molecule that can freely travel through cell membranes. Similarly to other gaseous molecules with known biological functions, like nitric oxide (NO) and carbon monoxide (CO), it is a physiologically important transmitter that is particularly abundant in the brain [<xref rid=""B1-antioxidants-13-01241"" ref-type=""bibr"">1</xref>]. H<sub>2</sub>S is produced in mammalian tissues through an endogenous synthetic system that consists primarily of three enzymes, cystathionine β-synthase (CBS), cystathionine γ-lyase (CSE), and mercapto-pyruvate sulfur transferase (MPST; also referred to as MST), through the cysteine transamination product 3-mercaptopyruvate [<xref rid=""B1-antioxidants-13-01241"" ref-type=""bibr"">1</xref>,<xref rid=""B2-antioxidants-13-01241"" ref-type=""bibr"">2</xref>,<xref rid=""B3-antioxidants-13-01241"" ref-type=""bibr"">3</xref>]. It is endogenously produced in the brain, mainly in astrocytes [<xref rid=""B4-antioxidants-13-01241"" ref-type=""bibr"">4</xref>,<xref rid=""B5-antioxidants-13-01241"" ref-type=""bibr"">5</xref>], although the neuronal contribution to its production appears to be fundamental, since CBS expression and H<sub>2</sub>S production are influenced by the presence of neurons [<xref rid=""B6-antioxidants-13-01241"" ref-type=""bibr"">6</xref>]. In physiological conditions, endogenous H<sub>2</sub>S is not toxic to cells [<xref rid=""B7-antioxidants-13-01241"" ref-type=""bibr"">7</xref>,<xref rid=""B8-antioxidants-13-01241"" ref-type=""bibr"">8</xref>]. However, depending on its concentration, it may have a beneficial or adverse role [<xref rid=""B9-antioxidants-13-01241"" ref-type=""bibr"">9</xref>]. In mitochondria, like cyanide, it directly inhibits cytochrome c oxidase (Complex IV), blocking respiration and ATP synthesis [<xref rid=""B10-antioxidants-13-01241"" ref-type=""bibr"">10</xref>] and inducing substantially more oxidative stress than cyanide [<xref rid=""B11-antioxidants-13-01241"" ref-type=""bibr"">11</xref>]. It inhibits oxidative-stress-induced apoptosis at low doses, while a relatively higher dose aggravates the ailment by promoting the same pathway [<xref rid=""B12-antioxidants-13-01241"" ref-type=""bibr"">12</xref>]. In cultured astrocytes from the spinal cord, it induces Ca<sup>2+</sup> release from mitochondria and the endoplasmic reticulum, provoking an increase in lactate production [<xref rid=""B5-antioxidants-13-01241"" ref-type=""bibr"">5</xref>,<xref rid=""B13-antioxidants-13-01241"" ref-type=""bibr"">13</xref>]. In our previous work, we measured poisonous concentrations of H<sub>2</sub>S in the liquor of patients affected by Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS), a neurodegenerative disease with sporadic or familial forms, characterized by the progressive death of spinal and cortical motor neurons and the involvement of non-neuronal cells, such as astrocytes [<xref rid=""B14-antioxidants-13-01241"" ref-type=""bibr"">14</xref>,<xref rid=""B15-antioxidants-13-01241"" ref-type=""bibr"">15</xref>]. In the same work, we also demonstrated that H<sub>2</sub>S is toxic to motor neurons and that its medium concentration decreases when astrocyte proliferation is halted by arabinoside-C (Ara-C) [<xref rid=""B16-antioxidants-13-01241"" ref-type=""bibr"">16</xref>]. Furthermore, we also showed [<xref rid=""B14-antioxidants-13-01241"" ref-type=""bibr"">14</xref>] that its concentration is increased in primary spinal cord cultures prepared from a genetic ALS mouse model, using SOD1G93A mice, carrying a point mutation at position 93 in the superoxide dismutase 1 protein, which is linked to a familial form of ALS [<xref rid=""B17-antioxidants-13-01241"" ref-type=""bibr"">17</xref>]. Here, we sought to further investigate the effects of H<sub>2</sub>S on primary spinal cord cultures by evaluating whether H<sub>2</sub>S modulates glial cell phenotypes and morphology as well as its metabolic function on mitochondrial bioenergetics.   Most of the biomolecules present in our body possess both physiological and pathological roles. Hydrogen sulfide is no exception, having a dual action either as being a neuroprotective and anti-inflammatory agent or a neurotoxic and pro-inflammatory agent [<xref rid=""B5-antioxidants-13-01241"" ref-type=""bibr"">5</xref>]. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to gain additional insight into our understanding of its cellular actions, paying particular attention to its effects on astrocytes. Moving from being merely considered a cellular layer filling between and gluing neurons, astrocytes have become recognized for their fundamental role in controlling CNS homeostasis, acting as neurotransmitter recyclers, providing nourishment for neurons, and operating to provide function and stability to the neuronal networks [<xref rid=""B43-antioxidants-13-01241"" ref-type=""bibr"">43</xref>,<xref rid=""B44-antioxidants-13-01241"" ref-type=""bibr"">44</xref>,<xref rid=""B45-antioxidants-13-01241"" ref-type=""bibr"">45</xref>]. Indeed, astrocytes are extremely reactive cells that actively respond to CNS challenges, and they are now a hallmark of many neuro-pathologies, like ALS [<xref rid=""B46-antioxidants-13-01241"" ref-type=""bibr"">46</xref>,<xref rid=""B47-antioxidants-13-01241"" ref-type=""bibr"">47</xref>,<xref rid=""B48-antioxidants-13-01241"" ref-type=""bibr"">48</xref>,<xref rid=""B49-antioxidants-13-01241"" ref-type=""bibr"">49</xref>,<xref rid=""B50-antioxidants-13-01241"" ref-type=""bibr"">50</xref>]. Reactive astrocytes can change their shape as well as their morphology, leading to different patterns of secretion from anti-inflammatory to pro-inflammatory and toxic factors [<xref rid=""B51-antioxidants-13-01241"" ref-type=""bibr"">51</xref>]. As demonstrated by us and others [<xref rid=""B4-antioxidants-13-01241"" ref-type=""bibr"">4</xref>,<xref rid=""B13-antioxidants-13-01241"" ref-type=""bibr"">13</xref>], H<sub>2</sub>S is released by astrocytes. Here, we pinpoint its ability to affect glial cells connecting the network and promoting their transformation to distinct subtypes without changing their overall number. Our results indicate that H<sub>2</sub>S functions as an inflammatory mediator, as is suggested by the increase in the body volume and by the switch from the A2 to the A1 astrocytic subtype, despite not affecting GFAP expression and the astrocytic cell count. These observations are in line with a theory picturing H<sub>2</sub>S as one of the factors released by glial cells [<xref rid=""B4-antioxidants-13-01241"" ref-type=""bibr"">4</xref>] in a toxic environment that, in turn, smooth the transition of astrocytes to a reactive form, which consecutively worsens the same toxic environment. The effect of H<sub>2</sub>S on astrocytic activation was further confirmed by the Cx43 protein data. Almad et al. linked the increase in Cx43 hemichannels with astrocytic-mediated toxicity to motor neurons in ALS [<xref rid=""B52-antioxidants-13-01241"" ref-type=""bibr"">52</xref>,<xref rid=""B53-antioxidants-13-01241"" ref-type=""bibr"">53</xref>]. As previously demonstrated by us and confirmed here, H<sub>2</sub>S is toxic to motor neurons, and we reported that its levels are increased in the cerebrospinal fluid of ALS patients and in an animal model SOD1G93A [<xref rid=""B13-antioxidants-13-01241"" ref-type=""bibr"">13</xref>,<xref rid=""B54-antioxidants-13-01241"" ref-type=""bibr"">54</xref>]. Hence, similarly to NO [<xref rid=""B55-antioxidants-13-01241"" ref-type=""bibr"">55</xref>], H<sub>2</sub>S also leads to phenotypic changes in astrocytes toward a reactive phenotype and the upregulation of Cx43. Cxs are principal constituents of gap junction channels and hemichannels, mediators of astrocyte communication with neighboring glial cells, and an extracellular medium that plays significant roles in physiological (tissue homeostasis and metabolic transport) and pathological (apoptosis) processes [<xref rid=""B29-antioxidants-13-01241"" ref-type=""bibr"">29</xref>,<xref rid=""B52-antioxidants-13-01241"" ref-type=""bibr"">52</xref>,<xref rid=""B53-antioxidants-13-01241"" ref-type=""bibr"">53</xref>,<xref rid=""B56-antioxidants-13-01241"" ref-type=""bibr"">56</xref>]. It is noteworthy that increased Cx43 levels have also been described in Alzheimer’s disease and Parkinson’s disease and have been linked to the dysregulation and activation of astrocytes [<xref rid=""B57-antioxidants-13-01241"" ref-type=""bibr"">57</xref>,<xref rid=""B58-antioxidants-13-01241"" ref-type=""bibr"">58</xref>,<xref rid=""B59-antioxidants-13-01241"" ref-type=""bibr"">59</xref>,<xref rid=""B60-antioxidants-13-01241"" ref-type=""bibr"">60</xref>]. We then sought to postulate a potential mechanism for the H<sub>2</sub>S-induced toxic effect on astrocytes by modulating mitochondrial bioenergetics. Here, we showed that in primary spinal cord cultures, H<sub>2</sub>S-mediated toxicity was caused by the mitochondrial release of cytochrome c and the activation of caspase-3, as well as a time-dependent generalized disequilibrium in the mitochondrial membrane potential, an impairment in mitochondrial respiration parameters, and a consequent drop in ATP production. The activation of apoptosis is consistent with our data here and with a previous report, where we showed that H<sub>2</sub>S toxicity is partly reverted by the inhibition of a Bax-dependent mechanism [<xref rid=""B18-antioxidants-13-01241"" ref-type=""bibr"">18</xref>]. Bax activation promotes the mitochondrial apoptotic pathway, which results in the release of cytochrome c and caspase-3 cleavage (key biochemical hallmarks of apoptosis). Nagai et al. [<xref rid=""B61-antioxidants-13-01241"" ref-type=""bibr"">61</xref>] provided strong evidence that a Bax-dependent cell death pathway mediates non-cell autonomous motor neuron death in the pathology of ALS. Hence, as we have already proposed [<xref rid=""B14-antioxidants-13-01241"" ref-type=""bibr"">14</xref>,<xref rid=""B18-antioxidants-13-01241"" ref-type=""bibr"">18</xref>], these results further imply the participation of H<sub>2</sub>S as an astrocytic release factor in the non-cell autonomous degeneration described in ALS. Mitochondrial bioenergetic data were analyzed with and without Ara-C to evaluate whether limiting the number of glial cells could have an impact on the overall mitochondrial homeostasis under H<sub>2</sub>S. We did not observe any effect on mitochondrial function due to the presence or absence of glial cells. All the parameters evaluated, i.e., basal respiration, maximal respiration, spare respiratory capacity, and ATP production, were decreased under the H<sub>2</sub>S treatment. Hence, we confirm that H<sub>2</sub>S toxicity is associated with compromised mitochondrial function, with reduced oxygen consumption, and with a sharp decrease in ATP production. Because mitochondrial dysfunction leads to an abnormal metabolism [<xref rid=""B62-antioxidants-13-01241"" ref-type=""bibr"">62</xref>], we investigated the effect of H<sub>2</sub>S on components of the lactate shuttle, which is a lactate-driven fuel source between neurons and astrocytes [<xref rid=""B63-antioxidants-13-01241"" ref-type=""bibr"">63</xref>] and is composed of three monocarboxylate transporters (MCT1, MCT2, and MCT4), two lactate dehydrogenase subunits (LDH-A and LDH-B), and the Na<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup> ATPase α2 subunit known to associate with MCT1 [<xref rid=""B27-antioxidants-13-01241"" ref-type=""bibr"">27</xref>,<xref rid=""B64-antioxidants-13-01241"" ref-type=""bibr"">64</xref>]. LDH-A has been associated with the conversion of pyruvate to lactate, while LDH-B is linked to the conversion of lactate to pyruvate [<xref rid=""B61-antioxidants-13-01241"" ref-type=""bibr"">61</xref>]. From our data, which showed a significant increase in LDH-B accompanied by a significant decrease in LDH-A, we can infer that the H<sub>2</sub>S treatment favored a shift toward an increased production of pyruvate or a likely decrease in the pyruvate-to-lactate conversion, an important pathway in ATP generation [<xref rid=""B63-antioxidants-13-01241"" ref-type=""bibr"">63</xref>,<xref rid=""B64-antioxidants-13-01241"" ref-type=""bibr"">64</xref>,<xref rid=""B65-antioxidants-13-01241"" ref-type=""bibr"">65</xref>]. Furthermore, the concurrent significant decrease in MTC1 and the decrease (although not significant) in MCT4 indicate that the transfer of the lactate dehydrogenase product from astrocytes to neurons was further compromised. Lactate is the end product of the glycolytic metabolism and a central substrate of energy metabolism for neurons [<xref rid=""B27-antioxidants-13-01241"" ref-type=""bibr"">27</xref>]. Hence, we can envision a context in which H<sub>2</sub>S toxicity alters mitochondrial function and hampers lactate production and transport, thus depriving neurons of their essential fuel. Furthermore, due to the active role of astrocytes in ALS-related motor neuron death and since neuroinflammation induces the formation of reactive astrocytes, which are considered harmful and known to induce the death of neurons and oligodendrocytes [<xref rid=""B66-antioxidants-13-01241"" ref-type=""bibr"">66</xref>], our data showing a role for H<sub>2</sub>S in inducing an A2-to-A1 shift support the hypothesis of this gaseous mediator as an astrocytic agent that, together with other toxins, likely drives neuronal degeneration by increasing neuroinflammation and hampering metabolic supply to neurons. Although the underlying mechanism(s) leading to the overproduction of H<sub>2</sub>S in ALS is yet to be determined, our findings provide further insights into the role of H<sub>2</sub>S as a pro-inflammatory agent released by astrocytes and that acts as a paracrine/autocrine mediator in glial cells, affecting the reactivity of astrocytes and their ability to nurture motor neurons.",N/A,15 10 2024
Perceived Pain in People Living with Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis—A Scoping Review,"(1) Background: Pain is a common symptom in patients with Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS). There are no evidence-based pharmacological treatments for pain in ALS; recommendations are based on guidelines for chronic non-oncological pain and clinical experience. The aim is to map the literature on how people with ALS experience pain, and how this affects their daily activities and social relationships. (2) Methods: This scoping review included studies concerning patients with spinal/bulbar ALS aged ≥ 18 years who experience pain, focusing on perception, characteristics, treatment, and impact on quality of life. Temporal and linguistic criteria were applied when searching the MEDLINE, CINAHL, and SCOPUS databases. (3) Results: The management of pain in these patients is complex and involves the use of anti-inflammatory drugs, analgesics, and opioids. Pain is associated with other conditions such as depression and anxiety, which contribute to a deterioration in the quality of life. Moreover, pain may also negatively influence patient compliance with prescribed treatment regimens and the quality of care they perceive themselves to be receiving. (4) Conclusions: It is of the most importance to identify effective ways to assess and treat this issue, with health care professionals taking an active role in this process.","Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) is a progressive disease caused by motor neuron degeneration in the spinal cord and brain, resulting in paralysis and usually death by respiratory failure [<xref rid=""B1-nursrep-14-00220"" ref-type=""bibr"">1</xref>]. The onset of ALS usually manifests as limb weakness (spinal onset) or difficulty speaking or swallowing (bulbar onset). In particular, the onset of ALS is more common among men in the 70–80 age group. Annually, ALS affects approximately 2 to 3 people per 100,000 [<xref rid=""B2-nursrep-14-00220"" ref-type=""bibr"">2</xref>]. The median age at ALS diagnosis is 65.2 years (IQR 56.0–72.2 years) for men and 67.0 years (IQR 59.0–74.0 years) for women [<xref rid=""B3-nursrep-14-00220"" ref-type=""bibr"">3</xref>]. Between 58 and 82% of people with ALS have a spinal onset [<xref rid=""B4-nursrep-14-00220"" ref-type=""bibr"">4</xref>]. The most recently available data, for the average incidence rate in the United States, is reported as being 2–3 per 100,000, with an age-adjusted prevalence of 6.6 per 100,000. There has been an increase in this rate in recent decades [<xref rid=""B5-nursrep-14-00220"" ref-type=""bibr"">5</xref>]. In Europe, the incidence of ALS is between 2.1 and 3.8 per 100,000 people [<xref rid=""B3-nursrep-14-00220"" ref-type=""bibr"">3</xref>]. ALS is a multi-system disease characterised by the presence of early and diverse non-motor symptoms. Non-motor symptoms, such as cognitive impairments [<xref rid=""B6-nursrep-14-00220"" ref-type=""bibr"">6</xref>], behavioural disturbances [<xref rid=""B7-nursrep-14-00220"" ref-type=""bibr"">7</xref>], autonomic dysfunctions [<xref rid=""B8-nursrep-14-00220"" ref-type=""bibr"">8</xref>], and sensory/painful disorders [<xref rid=""B9-nursrep-14-00220"" ref-type=""bibr"">9</xref>], play a significant role in the disease’s clinical presentation. These manifestations not only contribute to the overall burden of the disease, but may also serve as important indicators of its progression and impact on patient survival. Until the past decade, pain in ALS was largely overlooked by clinicians. Nevertheless, the substantial impact on the quality of life of ALS patients and their caregivers necessitates the identification and evaluation of this issue. Recent ALS treatment guidelines have indicated that pain may be a presenting symptom in ALS patients and should, therefore, be treated [<xref rid=""B10-nursrep-14-00220"" ref-type=""bibr"">10</xref>]. However, given the paucity of empirical evidence on this topic, pain in ALS is frequently underdiagnosed and inadequately addressed [<xref rid=""B2-nursrep-14-00220"" ref-type=""bibr"">2</xref>,<xref rid=""B10-nursrep-14-00220"" ref-type=""bibr"">10</xref>]. Although the mechanism underlying pain in ALS remains poorly understood, a substantial body of research indicates that pain prevalence among patients with this condition exhibits considerable variability, with estimates ranging from 15% to 85% [<xref rid=""B11-nursrep-14-00220"" ref-type=""bibr"">11</xref>]. Such conditions are commonly associated with and a consequence of various factors, including muscle contractures, reduced joint mobility, muscle cramps, spasticity, and pressure on the skin due to prolonged periods of immobility [<xref rid=""B12-nursrep-14-00220"" ref-type=""bibr"">12</xref>,<xref rid=""B13-nursrep-14-00220"" ref-type=""bibr"">13</xref>]. Moreover, although the World Health Organization (WHO) definition of palliative care places a strong emphasis on the importance of pain relief measures, there is currently no evidence-based pharmacological treatment for pain in ALS. Indeed, the recommendations for treatment are based on guidelines for chronic non-oncological pain, which are then combined with the clinical experience of treating patients with ALS and pain [<xref rid=""B14-nursrep-14-00220"" ref-type=""bibr"">14</xref>]. This scoping review aims to provide an overview of research investigating how patients perceive pain and its impact on activities of daily living, as well as social relationships and adherence to the treatment pathway. The objective of a scoping review is to map and summarise disparate forms of research evidence (quantitative and qualitative), which illustrates the breadth and depth of a given concept or phenomenon within its disciplinary or professional context [<xref rid=""B15-nursrep-14-00220"" ref-type=""bibr"">15</xref>]. This scoping review has been conducted in accordance with the JBI Manual for Evidence Synthesis [<xref rid=""B16-nursrep-14-00220"" ref-type=""bibr"">16</xref>] and in accordance with the PRISMA ScR checklist [<xref rid=""B17-nursrep-14-00220"" ref-type=""bibr"">17</xref>] for its construction. Prior to the writing of the review, a planned search was conducted on PROSPERO and the JBI Review Register to ensure that there are no ongoing review protocols on this topic. The primary research question guiding this review was as follows: What is the impact of pain in ALS patients? Secondary questions were identified that may be useful in outlining how the evidence was mapped. These included the following. The research question was structured according to the Participant-Problem/Concept/Context (PCC) Framework, as proposed in the ‘JBI Manual for Evidence Synthesis,’ in order to guide and direct the development of specific eligibility criteria, keywords, and search strategies [<xref rid=""B16-nursrep-14-00220"" ref-type=""bibr"">16</xref>] (<xref rid=""nursrep-14-00220-t001"" ref-type=""table"">Table 1</xref>).  This scoping review aims to provide an overview of the ways in which individuals with ALS perceive pain and the extent to which it impacts activities of daily living, social relationships, and adherence to the care pathway, despite the definition of palliative care. A significant degree of heterogeneity emerges regarding the perceived sensation of pain by patients with spinal or bulbar ALS. Pain is a common occurrence in this disease, manifesting in various forms and exhibiting unpredictable patterns over the course of the disease [<xref rid=""B20-nursrep-14-00220"" ref-type=""bibr"">20</xref>]. However, it has a profound impact on the quality of life of those affected [<xref rid=""B13-nursrep-14-00220"" ref-type=""bibr"">13</xref>]. Given that the pain experienced by patients with Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) is subject to variation in terms of its characteristics, including intensity, frequency, and location, there is a clear requirement for the development and implementation of methods of pain assessment and management within this patient population [<xref rid=""B20-nursrep-14-00220"" ref-type=""bibr"">20</xref>]. These methods can assist health care personnel in the recognition and effective treatment of this symptom, thereby improving the quality of life for these patients. It is of the utmost importance that all health care professionals who treat these patients are fully aware of the necessity of pain assessment and management, particularly given the evidence that many of them fail to report pain to the health care professionals responsible for their care. Therefore, it is essential that the initiative to address this issue comes from the care team itself [<xref rid=""B20-nursrep-14-00220"" ref-type=""bibr"">20</xref>].",N/A,17 10 2024
Recognized cases of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis in automobile workers by the Korean Epidemiologic Investigation Evaluation Committee,,"The incidence of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) in Europe and North America is estimated to range from 1.55 to 2.7 per 100,000 individuals, with a prevalence of 2.7 to 7.4 per 100,000 people. Previous reports have suggested that its incidence and prevalence are lower among Africans, Asians, and Hispanics than among Caucasian populations. However, whether specific racial groups have inherently lower incidence or prevalence rates cannot be definitively determined due to the various research methodologies used across countries. The prevalence ratio between men and women is approximately 1.3–1.5 to 1, indicating a higher rate in men. Nonetheless, this sex disparity almost disappears after the age of 70 years. The onset of ALS tends to increase with age, particularly after 40 years, peaking at age 74 years, and then declining.<xref rid=""b1-aoem-2024-36-e28"" ref-type=""bibr"">1</xref>-<xref rid=""b3-aoem-2024-36-e28"" ref-type=""bibr"">3</xref> ALS is classified into familial and sporadic types, with sporadic cases lacking specific genetic risk factors and accounting for 90%–95% of all cases. Most familial ALS cases are inherited in an autosomal dominant manner, with about 20% caused by mutations in chromosome 21, which houses the gene responsible for encoding the enzyme superoxide dismutase 1. ALS is a multifactorial and multifocal disease with an unclear pathogenesis. Various potential causes, including genetic factors, autoimmune reactions, occupational and environmental influences, oxidative stress, glutamate excitotoxicity, mitochondrial damage, defective axonal transport, and abnormalities in glial cells, are being investigated. In addition, metabolic abnormalities in DNA and RNA, paraneoplastic syndromes, lymphomas, plasma cell disorders (paraproteinemia), toxic effects of heavy metals, and viral infections are also being explored. However, the precise pathogenesis of ALS is yet to be explained.<xref rid=""b4-aoem-2024-36-e28"" ref-type=""bibr"">4</xref> Patients with ALS typically present with progressive voluntary muscle weakness that spreads to adjacent body segments, often succumbing to respiratory failure within 2–4 years of diagnosis.

Additionally, during his 33 years in the engine construction and assembly department, he was exposed to substantial amounts of diesel exhaust gas. Insufficient use of exhaust devices and protective equipment during work likely led to prolonged exposure to various harmful substances. Patients B and C, who worked in the engine department for about 25 and 30 years, respectively, were exposed to lead and benzene from gasoline during engine ignition tests for approximately 15 and 16 years, respectively. They were also likely to have been exposed to welding fumes, heavy metals, and organic solvents during welding and painting operations. Furthermore, they were continuously exposed to diesel exhaust gas emitted from logistics vehicles idling nearby. The job-related exposures of patients A, B, and C are summarized in <xref rid=""t1-aoem-2024-36-e28"" ref-type=""table"">Table 1</xref>. Patients A, B, and C developed ALS at the ages of 55, 49, and 50 years, respectively, which is earlier than the peak age for ALS onset, and none had a medical or family history related to neurological diseases. Despite a genetic predisposition, clear occupational hazards associated with ALS have not been definitively identified. This ambiguity may stem from the difficulty of statistical interpretation due to the very low prevalence of the disease (2.7–7.4 per 100,000 persons). Despite the very low prevalence, the reported cases developed the same disease through the same or similar processes. Although quantitatively assessing patients' exposure to harmful substances is challenging, the epidemiological investigation committee which is described in <xref rid=""t2-aoem-2024-36-e28"" ref-type=""table"">Table 2</xref> concluded that the patients had been chronically exposed to lead, organic solvents, and diesel exhaust gas during their work.

Revisiting distinct nerve excitability patterns in patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis,"Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis is a devastating neurodegenerative disease, characterized by loss of central and peripheral motor neurons. Although the disease is clinically and genetically heterogeneous, axonal hyperexcitability is a commonly observed feature that has been suggested to reflect an early pathophysiological step linked to the neurodegenerative cascade. Therefore, it is important to clarify the mechanisms causing axonal hyperexcitability and how these relate to the clinical characteristics of patients. Measures derived directly from a nerve excitability recording are frequently used as study end points, although their biophysical basis is difficult to deduce. Mathematical models can aid in the interpretation but are reliable only when applied to group-averaged recordings. Consequently, model estimates of membrane properties cannot be compared with clinical characteristics or treatment effects in individual patients, posing a considerable limitation in heterogeneous diseases, such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. To address these challenges, we revisited nerve excitability using a new pattern analysis-based approach (principal component analysis). We evaluated disease-specific patterns of excitability changes and established their biophysical origins. Based on the observed patterns, we developed new compound measures of excitability that facilitate the implementation of this approach in clinical settings. We found that excitability changes in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis patients (<italic toggle=""yes"">n</italic> = 161, median disease duration = 11 months) were characterized by four unique patterns compared with controls (<italic toggle=""yes"">n</italic> = 50, age and sex matched). These four patterns were best explained by changes in resting membrane potential (modulated by Na<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup> currents), slow potassium and sodium currents (modulated by their gating kinetics) and refractory properties of the nerve. Consequently, we were able to show that altered gating of slow potassium channels was associated with, and predictive of, the rate of progression of the disease on the amyotrophic lateral sclerosis functional rating scale. Based on these findings, we designed four composite measures that capture these properties to facilitate implementation outside this study. Our findings demonstrate that changes in nerve excitability in patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis are dominated by four distinct patterns, each with a distinct biophysical origin. Based on this new approach, we provide evidence that altered slow potassium-channel function might play a role in the rate of disease progression. The magnitudes of these patterns, quantified using a similar approach or our new composite measures, have potential as efficient measures to study membrane properties directly in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis patients, and thus aid prognostic stratification and trial design. Stikvoort <italic toggle=""yes"">et al.</italic> report that nerve excitability in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis is characterized by four unique patterns, each originating from changes in different membrane properties. Excitability changes related to altered gating kinetics of slow potassium channels are associated with, and predictive of, the rate of disease progression.","Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a devastating disease characterized by progressive loss of central and peripheral motor neurons.<sup><xref rid=""awae131-B1"" ref-type=""bibr"">1</xref></sup> Despite the clinical and genetic heterogeneity of the disease,<sup><xref rid=""awae131-B1"" ref-type=""bibr"">1</xref></sup> hyperexcitability is present in central and peripheral motor neurons.<sup><xref rid=""awae131-B2"" ref-type=""bibr"">2</xref>,<xref rid=""awae131-B3"" ref-type=""bibr"">3</xref></sup> It has been suggested that these changes in excitability represent a key pathophysiological step in the cascade leading to motor neuron death.<sup><xref rid=""awae131-B4"" ref-type=""bibr"">4</xref>,<xref rid=""awae131-B5"" ref-type=""bibr"">5</xref></sup> Measures of peripheral nerve excitability are valuable because they facilitate more detailed electrophysiological evaluation and enable verification of target engagement of potential candidate compounds that can modulate membrane excitability.<sup><xref rid=""awae131-B6"" ref-type=""bibr"">6-10</xref></sup> Therefore, it is imperative to determine which membrane properties drive these changes, whether these are unique to patients with similar clinical profiles, and to clarify their association with the neurodegenerative process. Advanced neurophysiological techniques, such as nerve excitability testing, allow non-invasive assessment of nerve excitability properties by tracking threshold changes in a group of axons at one nerve site.<sup><xref rid=""awae131-B11"" ref-type=""bibr"">11</xref></sup> These threshold changes are dependent on the underlying membrane properties, such as the resting membrane potential, voltage-gated ion channels and pumps.

Consequently, membrane properties are often estimated using group-averaged excitability measures, which cannot be associated with clinical metrics or individual treatment responses. Considering ALS heterogeneity, new approaches are needed to gain a better understanding of the role of excitability changes in the pathophysiology of the disease and to leverage this valuable technique optimally for application in clinical settings. In this study, we revisited excitability changes in patients with ALS using a new approach. Principal component analysis (PCA) was applied to the full set of nerve excitability measures from patients with ALS. Our aims were as follows: (i) to identify ALS-specific excitability patterns and their biophysical origins; (ii) to study the relationship between the newly identified excitability patterns and the clinical profiles of patients; and (iii) to develop new, simple, compound measures that reflect these identified excitability patterns and that could facilitate practical implementation.   In this study, we revisited nerve excitability changes in patients with ALS using a new analysis approach, demonstrating that excitability changes in ALS patients are characterized by four distinct patterns, each originating from changes in different membrane properties. The magnitudes of these patterns, obtained directly from recordings of individual patients, can, therefore, provide insights into the underlying membrane properties. Most notably, we showed that excitability changes related to altered gating kinetics of slow potassium channels were associated with, and predictive of, the progression rates of patients. Based on our findings, we propose a set of composite measures that can be derived quickly, for practical implementation in clinical practice and trials. Our findings have provided several new insights into the relationships between clinical characteristics of ALS patients and nerve excitability measures. Longitudinal examinations will be required to characterize the temporal attributes of the identified patterns of excitability changes better. Nevertheless, we provide new <italic toggle=""yes"">in vivo</italic> evidence that altered gating kinetics of slow potassium channels are related to the disease progression rate. This electrophysiological signature can now be obtained efficiently from an excitability recording of an individual patient using the proposed composite excitability measures and could be valuable as a biomarker for future trials. In summary, we believe that our findings, our approach to the analysis and the new composite measures can be used to leverage this neurophysiological technique optimally to the benefit of clinical practice and the testing of new drugs in patients with ALS.

Microvascular abnormalities in skin capillaries of individuals with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis,"This is the first study aimed to detect morphological abnormalities in vivo in the skin capillaries of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis patients (ALS). Videocapillaroscopy assessed subungueal capillaries in 28 ALS patients (cases) and 35 controls (p = 0.42). The mean age was 61.46 and 61.23 years, respectively (p > 0.99). No statistically significant differences were observed between the groups regarding dominant hand, arterial hypertension, dyslipidemia, diabetes mellitus, active smoker, and former smoker variables. 78.57% of cases had spinal onset and 21.43% bulbar. The median disease duration (time between the onset of symptoms and the date of videocapillarscopy) was 29.71 months. Dilated capillaries were detected in 17.8% of cases and 11.43% of controls (p = 0.49). The median of capillary diameter in cases was 10.15 µm and 8.72 µm in controls (p = 0.011). 35.71% of cases and 2.86% of controls had severe capillary tortuosities (p < 0.001). Ramified capillaries were observed in 46.43% of cases and 11.43% of controls (p < 0.002). Micro-hemorrhages were only observed in 10.71% of cases. No significant correlations were observed between disease duration and dilated capillaries, tortuosity, ramified capillaries, and micro-hemorrhages. The present in vivo study shows abnormalities in the skin capillaries of ALS patients that do not depend on disease duration.","Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a neurodegenerative disease that affects upper and lower motor neurons, producing focal onset motor deficits. The course of the disease is rapidly progressive, leading to death, usually due to respiratory failure, in 3–5 years from the onset of symptoms<sup><xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR1"">1</xref></sup>. A common pathological alteration is the mis-localization and abnormal formation of phosphorylated transactive response DNA binding protein of 43 kDa (TDP-43) deposits in neurons, threads, and oligodendrocytes<sup><xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR2"">2</xref>,<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR3"">3</xref></sup>. About 5–16% of patients have a family history of ALS, and they are classified as familial ALS (fALS), while the remaining patients are categorized as sporadic ALS (sALS)<sup><xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR4"">4</xref></sup>. In addition to motor neurons, blood vessels are also compromised in sALS and transgenic animal models bearing SOD1 mutations, which cause a small percentage of fALS. The blood vessel abnormalities in the nervous system involve thigh junctions, cell interactions, matrix metalloproteinases, transport systems, free radicals, and cytokines<sup><xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR5"">5</xref></sup>. About 54% of pericytes, as revealed with platelet-derived growth factor receptor-β immunohistochemistry, are lost in the spinal cord in ALS<sup><xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR6"">6</xref></sup>. In addition, immunoreactivity to vascular endothelial growth factor receptors VEGFR-1 and, to a lesser extent, VEGFR-2, is increased in blood vessels of ALS spinal cords<sup><xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR7"">7</xref></sup>. Moreover, deposits of abnormal TDP-43 occur in blood vessels of the spinal cord and frontal cortex area 8 in sALS<sup><xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR8"">8</xref></sup>. Electron microscopic examination of the spinal cord in SOD1 transgenic mice discloses disorganized mitochondrial cristae and degenerating mitochondria in endothelial cells and neuropil, swollen astrocyte foot processes, swollen and degenerating capillary endothelial cells and astrocytes, and extensive extracellular edema<sup><xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR9"">9</xref></sup>. The blood vessel anomalies in SOD1 transgenic mice appear before motor neuron degeneration and inflammatory responses, indicating that vascular changes contribute to disease initiation in murine models<sup><xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR10"">10</xref></sup>. Increased perivascular hemoglobin, hemosiderin deposits, plasma-derived immunoglobulin G, thrombin, fibrin, and blood vessel leakage are found in the spinal cord in ALS<sup><xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR11"">11</xref></sup>. These data point to cumulative factors contributing to the blood–brain barrier (BBB) and blood-spinal cord barrier (BSCB) dysfunction in ALS<sup><xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR12"">12</xref>,<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR13"">13</xref></sup>. Increased QAlb in the CSF is a marker of poor prognosis in a subset of sALS patients<sup><xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR14"">14</xref></sup>. Other studies have also shown altered blood vessels in ALS patients, including duplicated basement membranes, deposition of abnormal proteins, decreased collagen IV, fragmented collagen fibers, increased laminin IV, increased expression of VEGF, and altered pericytes<sup><xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR15"">15</xref>–<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR19"">19</xref></sup>. In vivo capillary imaging of spinal blood flow shows a progressive decrease in capillary diameter, capillary density, and red blood cell speed in the anterior gray matter from the pre-symptomatic stage of ALS model mice; moreover, local spinal glucose utilization is transiently increased at pre-symptomatic stages, only to decrease progressively at advanced stages of the disease in transgenic mice<sup><xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR20"">20</xref></sup>.

Another study carried out on a tissue-engineered skin model derived from skin biopsies from patients with ALS demonstrated, among other alterations, the presence of TDP-43 positive cytoplasmic aggregates with indirect immunofluorescence on a standard microscope as well as with a confocal microscope<sup><xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR23"">23</xref></sup>. These data suggest that vasculopathy in ALS is a systemic disorder not limited to the spinal cord and frontotemporal cortex. The capillaroscopy is a non-invasive technique that visualizes the capillaries of the nail bed using a light source and an optical magnifying system. In recent years, the method has been carried out using new equipment called videocapillaroscopy with an optical probe that allows output to a computer and offers the possibility of saving the information digitally<sup><xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR24"">24</xref></sup>. Various patterns of capillaroscopy indicative of different diseases have been established through the classification of Maricq et al.<sup><xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR25"">25</xref></sup>, modified by Cutolo et al.<sup><xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR26"">26</xref></sup>. This methodology could provide valuable insights into the vascular characteristics of ALS-affected capillaries, offering a more accurate and real-time understanding of capillary modifications in ALS patients. It also holds significant value as it allows the observation of capillary dynamics without the potential modifications introduced during biopsy procedures or in the processing of skin biopsy samples. Although numerous studies have explored vascular changes in the skin of ALS patients, it is noteworthy that the skin capillaries of ALS patients have never been evaluated in vivo. For this reason, our primary objective was to detect morphological abnormalities in vivo in the skin capillaries of ALS patients using this non-invasive technique, videocapillaroscopy. Twenty-eight ALS patients, 64.29% males and 35.71% females, and 35 healthy controls, 54.29% males and 45.71% females, were enrolled in the study. No statistically significant differences were observed between the groups (p = 0.42). The mean age of ALS patients was 61.46 (9.85) years, and for controls, it was 61.23 years (10.45). No statistically significant differences were observed between the groups (p > 0.99). All controls and 92.8% of ALS patients were right-handed, while 7.14% were left-handed, showing no statistically significant differences between the groups (p = 0.19). Regarding the comorbidities, 35.71% of ALS patients and 37.14% of healthy controls had arterial hypertension and dyslipidemia, with no statistically significant differences between the groups (p = 0.91). The prevalence of diabetes mellitus was 3.57% among ALS patients and 11.43% among healthy controls; no statistically significant differences were observed between the groups (p = 0.37). Additionally, 3.57% of ALS patients and 20.00% of healthy controls were active smokers, and 46.43% of ALS patients and 34.29% of healthy controls were former smokers. No statistically significant differences were observed between the groups (p = 0.066 and p = 0.33, respectively). Regarding the distribution of the ALS phenotype, 78.57% of patients exhibited a spinal onset, while 21.43% had a bulbar onset. Furthermore, 14.29% of ALS patients carried a C9orf72 hexanucleotide expansion. The median disease duration was 29.71 months [19.34, 48.38], and the ALS Functional Rate Scale (ALSFRS) slope median was 0.41 [0.26, 0.78] (Table <xref rid=""Tab1""

While capillaroscopy has been widely employed in diagnosing and monitoring various rheumatological disorders such as systemic lupus erythematosus<sup><xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR27"">27</xref></sup>, scleroderma<sup><xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR28"">28</xref></sup>, Raynaud’s phenomenon<sup><xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR26"">26</xref>,<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR28"">28</xref></sup>, and dermatomyositis<sup><xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR29"">29</xref></sup>, its application in ALS has been unexplored until now. It is recognized that various rheumatological diseases may show specific capillaroscopic patterns<sup><xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR25"">25</xref>,<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR26"">26</xref></sup>. However, it is relevant to note that the current study findings do not align with any known patterns established for these diseases. This study observed significant differences between ALS patients and the healthy control group. These differences encompassed moderate and severe tortuosity of capillaries, more ramified capillaries characterized by an increased number of branches, larger capillary diameter, and the presence of micro-hemorrhages. In contrast, no differences were detected in dilated capillary, capillary density, or avascular areas. Our cohort has no statistically significant differences regarding age, gender, or cardiovascular comorbidities. The study’s results have significant implications for two reasons. Firstly, they support that vascular alterations in ALS are not confined to the central nervous system. Rather, vascular pathology also affects skin capillaries, possibly through a different pathway than systemic sclerosis. These observations expand our understanding of ALS as a complex condition with effects extending beyond neuronal degeneration. Secondly, the specific findings identified in the study are of immense importance. Micro-hemorrhages indicate capillary damage, while the observation of increased ramified capillaries suggests increased angiogenesis<sup><xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR26"">26</xref>,<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR30"">30</xref></sup>. These observations align with microscopical studies in skin blood vessels showing duplicated basement membranes, deposition of abnormal proteins, decreased collagen IV, fragmented collagen fibers, increased laminin IV, increased expression of VEGF, and altered pericytes<sup><xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR15"">15</xref>–<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR19"">19</xref></sup>. The vascular etiology of ALS is not a novel concept. Previous research on SOD1 mutant mice demonstrated disruption of the blood-spinal cord barrier, resulting in micro-hemorrhages, reduced microcirculation, and hypoperfusion even before motor neuron degeneration and inflammatory responses occurred. These findings suggest that vascular changes contribute to disease initiation, at least in murine models<sup><xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR10"">10</xref></sup>. Moreover, other studies have shown significant increases in vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) levels in ALS patients’ cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and serum. Elevated VEGF levels have been positively correlated with disease duration and inversely correlated with disease progression rate<sup><xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR31"">31</xref></sup>. Importantly, increased immunoreactivity to VEGF receptors VEGFR-1 and, to a lesser extent, VEGFR-2 occurs in blood vessels of the ALS spinal cord<sup><xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR7"">7</xref></sup>. VEGF promotes angiogenesis and is an essential neurotrophic factor for motor neurons<sup><xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR32"">32</xref></sup>. We hypothesized that VEGF upregulation may indicate an activation of compensatory responses in ALS<sup><xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR31"">31</xref></sup> to preserve and prolong motor neuron survival through neurotrophic mechanisms and to increase vascularity through angiogenic processes. The angiogenic activity may increase vascularization, leading to alterations in patient skin, including those observed with capillaroscopy in our study. These distinct alterations were not linked to disease duration, thus suggesting that capillary alterations may be present individually at any time of the disease progression. Whether these changes appear at early stages of the disease in a subpopulation of ALS cases cannot be excluded with the present data. In conclusion, we found several abnormalities in the skin capillaries of ALS patients associated with angiogenic phenomena. Importantly, these alterations are not associated with the duration of the disease. Further studies involving larger patient cohorts are needed to evaluate whether these abnormalities could have prognostic implications for individuals with ALS. ",N/A,20 10 2024
"Allele-specific silencing of a dominant <italic toggle=""yes"">SETX</italic> mutation in familial amyotrophic lateral sclerosis type 4","Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis 4 (ALS4) is an autosomal dominant motor neuron disease that is molecularly characterized by reduced R-loop levels and caused by pathogenic variants in <italic toggle=""yes"">senataxin</italic> (<italic toggle=""yes"">SETX</italic>). <italic toggle=""yes"">SETX</italic> encodes an RNA/DNA helicase that resolves three-stranded nucleic acid structures called R-loops. Currently, there are no disease-modifying therapies available for ALS4. Given that <italic toggle=""yes"">SETX</italic> is haplosufficient, removing the product of the mutated allele presents a potential therapeutic strategy. We designed a series of siRNAs to selectively target the RNA transcript from the ALS4 allele containing the c.1166T>C mutation (p.Leu389Ser). Transfection of HEK293 cells with siRNA and plasmids encoding either wild-type or mutant (Leu389Ser) epitope tagged SETX revealed that three siRNAs specifically reduced mutant SETX protein levels without affecting the wild-type SETX protein. In ALS4 primary fibroblasts, siRNA treatment silenced the endogenous mutant <italic toggle=""yes"">SETX</italic> allele, while sparing the wild-type allele, and restored R-loop levels in patient cells. Our findings demonstrate that mutant <italic toggle=""yes"">SETX</italic>, differing from wild-type by a single nucleotide, can be effectively and specifically silenced by RNA interference, highlighting the potential of allele-specific siRNA as a therapeutic approach for ALS4.","Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis 4 (ALS4) is an autosomal dominant motor neuron disease with an average age of onset in the teenage years. Most patients have a slowly progressive disease course that includes symmetric muscle weakness in a predominantly distal distribution with hyperreflexia.<sup><xref rid=""R1"" ref-type=""bibr"">1</xref></sup> There is currently no disease modifying therapy available. ALS4 is caused by heterozygous missense mutations in <italic toggle=""yes"">senataxin</italic> (<italic toggle=""yes"">SETX</italic>).<sup><xref rid=""R2"" ref-type=""bibr"">2</xref></sup> Senataxin, an ortholog of the yeast sen1, is an ATP-dependent RNA/DNA helicase that resolves R-loops, three-stranded nucleic acid structures that include RNA/DNA hybrids and the displaced single-stranded DNA.<sup><xref rid=""R3"" ref-type=""bibr"">3</xref>–<xref rid=""R5"" ref-type=""bibr"">5</xref></sup> We have previously shown that autosomal dominant mutations in senataxin lead to gain of the SETX helicase function<sup><xref rid=""R6"" ref-type=""bibr"">6</xref></sup> and a reduction in R-loops. One of the common ALS4 mutations is the c.1166T>C transition (p.Leu389Ser, L389S). A Maryland family with an eleven-generation history of juvenile ALS harbors this <italic toggle=""yes"">SETX</italic> mutation, and many individuals from this family are followed by our group.<sup><xref rid=""R7"" ref-type=""bibr"">7</xref>,<xref rid=""R8"" ref-type=""bibr"">8</xref></sup> Previously, we performed deep phenotyping of these patients and biomarker identification, as well as extensive studies of the molecular effects of ALS4 mutations on SETX function.<sup><xref rid=""R6"" ref-type=""bibr"">6</xref>,<xref rid=""R8"" ref-type=""bibr"">8</xref></sup> Silencing the mutated allele may be a viable therapeutic strategy for ALS4 since the <italic toggle=""yes"">SETX</italic> gene is haplosufficient. Small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) are tools for sequence-based gene silencing and have been shown to offer allele specificity. Here, we identified and characterized siRNAs against the L389S <italic toggle=""yes"">SETX</italic> allele and demonstrated their effects on SETX biology and the functioning of patient cells.  ALS4, an autosomal dominant motor neuron disease caused by heterozygous mutations in senataxin, presents many of the challenges common to rare diseases in therapeutic development. In this study, we applied RNA interference (RNAi) to selectively silence the mutant senataxin allele while maintaining expression of the wild-type allele. We identified three siRNAs (1.11, 1.16, and 2.11) that specifically target the L389S mutation in SETX, which is responsible for ALS4. Silencing the mutant allele restored normal senataxin helicase activity. Previously, we demonstrated that autosomal dominant mutations in senataxin result in a gain of helicase function, leading to a reduction in R-loop levels in patient cells. This includes decreased R-loop abundance at the promoter of <italic toggle=""yes"">BAMBI</italic>, a negative regulator of TGFβ.<sup><xref rid=""R6"" ref-type=""bibr"">6</xref>,<xref rid=""R8"" ref-type=""bibr"">8</xref>,<xref rid=""R13"" ref-type=""bibr"">13</xref></sup> Here, we show that allele-specific silencing of the mutant <italic toggle=""yes"">SETX</italic> copy increases R-loop levels, including those at the <italic toggle=""yes"">BAMBI</italic> promoter, providing further evidence of restored RNA/DNA helicase function in patient-derived cells. Targeted knockdown of the mutant senataxin allele is crucial, as silencing both <italic toggle=""yes"">SETX</italic> alleles would likely replicate the loss-of-function phenotype seen in patients with oculomotor apraxia type 2 (AOA2), an autosomal recessive disorder caused by homozygous <italic toggle=""yes"">SETX</italic> mutations. Carriers of the autosomal recessive disorder AOA2, who possess heterozygous loss-of-function <italic toggle=""yes"">SETX</italic> mutations, are unaffected. This suggests that selective knockdown of the mutant allele, while maintaining wild-type <italic toggle=""yes"">SETX</italic> expression, may offer therapeutic benefit in ALS4. An advantage of siRNA technology is its ability to design therapeutic agents that specifically target the gene of interest. siRNA therapies were first approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 2018 for the treatment of transthyretin-associated amyloidosis,<sup><xref rid=""R14"" ref-type=""bibr"">14</xref></sup> and since then, several siRNAs have received FDA approval, with many more currently in clinical trials.<sup><xref rid=""R15"" ref-type=""bibr"">15</xref></sup> By targeting the underlying genetic mechanisms, siRNA therapies offer a precise way to intervene in the disease process for various Mendelian disorders.<sup><xref rid=""R16"" ref-type=""bibr"">16</xref></sup> The ability to design gene-targeting therapies with specificity has made this approach feasible for treating rare neurological diseases.<sup><xref rid=""R17"" ref-type=""bibr"">17</xref></sup> Our findings demonstrate that this gene-targeting strategy can mitigate toxicity in a rare form of genetic ALS. Importantly, our approach can be adapted for allele-specificity, enabling selective knockdown of the mutant <italic toggle=""yes"">SETX</italic> allele with minimal impact on the wild-type copy. In summary, this study underscores the potential of allele-specific siRNA as a therapeutic approach for ALS4. Our experiments, conducted in seven patient samples, provide robust evidence of efficacy across multiple ALS4 patients, supporting the further development of this strategy for clinical use. The next step involves optimizing the siRNAs, such as through chemical modifications, to enhance pharmacodynamic properties like half-life, uptake, and activity, thus improving therapeutic efficacy<sup><xref rid=""R18"" ref-type=""bibr"">18</xref></sup> and advancing this ALS4 therapy toward clinical trials.

"Differentially expressed lncRNAs in SOD1<sup>G93A</sup> mice skeletal muscle: H19, Myhas and Neat1 as potential biomarkers in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis","Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a devastating neuromuscular disease characterized by progressive motor function and muscle mass loss. Despite extensive research in the field, the underlying causes of ALS remain incompletely understood, contributing to the absence of specific diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers and effective therapies. This study investigates the expression of long-non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) in skeletal muscle as a potential source of biomarkers and therapeutic targets for the disease. The expression profiles of 12 lncRNAs, selected from the literature, were evaluated across different disease stages in tissue and muscle biopsies from the SOD1<sup>G93A</sup> transgenic mouse model of ALS. Nine out of the 12 lncRNAs were differentially expressed, with Pvt1, H19 and Neat1 showing notable increases in the symptomatic stages of the disease, and suggesting their potential as candidate biomarkers to support diagnosis and key players in muscle pathophysiology in ALS. Furthermore, the progression of Myhas and H19 RNA levels across disease stages correlated with longevity in the SOD1<sup>G93A</sup> animal model, effectively discriminating between long- and short-term survival individuals, thereby highlighting their potential as prognostic indicators. These findings underscore the involvement of lncRNAs, especially H19 and Myhas, in ALS pathophysiology, offering novel insights for diagnostic, prognostic and therapeutic targets.","Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a neurodegenerative disease (NDD) characterized by the progressive and selective loss of motor neurons, resulting in muscle weakness, atrophy and dysfunction at the neuromotor junction. It is among the most common NDDs, with an annual incidence of 2.1 to 3.8 per 100 000 people in Europe [<xref rid=""B1"" ref-type=""bibr"">1</xref>]. Despite its relatively low incidence, ALS is a devastating disease of unknown aetiology and with no cure. It has a typical life expectancy of less than 5 years after symptom onset, although disease progression is highly variable among patients. Finding biomarkers for early and specific diagnosis of ALS, together with prognostic indicators of disease progression rate, is essential to extend the lifespan and improve the quality of life of these patients. Biomarkers are also of particular interest in elucidating ALS aetiology and pathogenic mechanisms, as well as unravelling potential intervention targets. Recently, skeletal muscle has gained significant attention as a source of candidate biomarkers in ALS due to the mounting evidence of its active contribution to disease pathology and its accessibility as compared to central nervous system (CNS) sample collection [<xref rid=""B2"" ref-type=""bibr"">2</xref>]. On this basis, differences in the concentration of prognostic biomarkers identified in hindlimb muscles from the SOD1<sup>G93A</sup> mouse model of ALS have been found to correlate with disease progression in patients’ blood samples [<xref rid=""B3"" ref-type=""bibr"">3</xref>,<xref rid=""B4"" ref-type=""bibr"">4</xref>]. Multiple cellular processes have been associated with ALS pathophysiology in muscle, including oxidative stress, mitochondrial and muscle metabolism dysfunction, protein aggregation, disrupted proteostasis, RNA processing abnormalities, impaired muscle regeneration and dysfunctional stem cell activity [<xref rid=""B2"" ref-type=""bibr"">2</xref>]. Nevertheless, recent research has highlighted the crucial role of RNA metabolism in the development of ALS. This notion is supported by the identification of mutations in genes responsible for RNA transcription or turnover (such as <italic toggle=""yes"">SOD1</italic>, <italic toggle=""yes"">C9orf72</italic>, <italic toggle=""yes"">TARDBP</italic> and <italic toggle=""yes"">FUS</italic>) in a significant number of familial ALS cases. Additionally, certain RNA-binding proteins, including hnRNPA2B1, MATR3, TAF15 and TIA1, have been implicated in ALS pathology [<xref rid=""B5"" ref-type=""bibr"">5</xref>,<xref rid=""B6"" ref-type=""bibr"">6</xref>]. Therefore, molecules involved in the regulation of RNA metabolism, such as long-non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs), could represent promising candidates for biomarkers studies in ALS. LncRNAs are RNA molecules of more than 200 nucleotides in length that are not translated into protein. They share similarities with protein-coding messenger RNAs (mRNAs) in terms of sequence length and transcriptional and post-transcriptional behaviour [<xref rid=""B7"" ref-type=""bibr"">7</xref>]. However, lncRNAs do not typically encode proteins and instead have distinct cellular functions. The precise roles of many lncRNAs are still under investigation, but it is well documented that they participate in various gene regulation pathways at the epigenetic, transcriptional, post-transcriptional, translational and post-translational levels. These pathways include splicing, mRNA turnover and translation, as well as methylation or signalling pathways in response to DNA damage and stress [<xref rid=""B8"" ref-type=""bibr"">8</xref>,<xref rid=""B9"" ref-type=""bibr"">9</xref>]. Consequently, lncRNAs influence critical cellular functions such as proteostasis, autophagy, apoptosis, inflammation, cell differentiation or cell cycle regulation and alteration of their expression prompt to numerous diseases [<xref rid=""B10"" ref-type=""bibr"">10</xref>–<xref rid=""B17"" ref-type=""bibr"">17</xref>]. Another major distinction between lncRNAs and mRNAs is their greater tissue specificity in terms of expression patterns and functions [<xref rid=""B7"" ref-type=""bibr"">7</xref>,<xref rid=""B18"" ref-type=""bibr"">18</xref>]. In fact, lncRNAs have been recently shown to exhibit sex- and disease-specific expression patterns, which highlights their potential as biomarkers and provides a rationale to target them clinically [<xref rid=""B19"" ref-type=""bibr"">19</xref>–<xref rid=""B24"" ref-type=""bibr"">24</xref>]. Importantly, several studies have reported potential alterations in lncRNA expression in ALS patients and mouse models by performing both transcriptional and bioinformatic studies [<xref rid=""B25"" ref-type=""bibr"">25</xref>–<xref rid=""B34"" ref-type=""bibr"">34</xref>]. However, most of them are cross-sectional studies focused on the CNS or peripheral blood mononuclear cells. This work is the first one addressing the differential expression of lncRNAs in ALS muscle and, in addition, integrating a longitudinal dimension in the study. In this line, it reveals differences in lncRNA expression in SOD1<sup>G93A</sup> muscles at different disease stages and correlation of H19 and Myhas with the lifespan of these animals.   Over the last few decades, there has been an intense effort to identify biomarkers for ALS that can accelerate diagnosis, which currently relies on excluding other possible conditions, and provide insights into patient prognosis as well as new potential therapeutic targets. The search for these biomarkers has involved all sorts of molecules and has primarily focused on tissues such as the brain, spinal cord, cerebrospinal fluid, blood and skeletal muscle. Despite the extensive investigations and the emergence of molecules like neurofilaments entering clinical trials, none of them has been implemented in actual clinical practice yet [<xref rid=""B55"" ref-type=""bibr"">55</xref>]. The emergence of lncRNAs has opened up new possibilities in the field of biomarker discovery. These molecules show tissue- and sex-dependent expression patterns and functions, which enables the identification of specific disease patterns [<xref rid=""B19"" ref-type=""bibr"">19</xref>]. Indeed, in recent years lncRNAs have been shown to be impaired and play an important role in several neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson’s disease and Alzheimer’s disease or multiple sclerosis [<xref rid=""B46"" ref-type=""bibr"">46</xref>,<xref rid=""B56"" ref-type=""bibr"">56</xref>–<xref rid=""B63"" ref-type=""bibr"">63</xref>]. However, their involvement in ALS is still unclear. In this work, we first conducted an analysis of 12 lncRNAs’ expression in the muscle of SOD1<sup>G93A</sup> mouse model of ALS to determine putative dysregulations and to evaluate their potential as disease biomarkers. Skeletal muscle was selected as it is considered a primary target in ALS toxicity [<xref rid=""B2"" ref-type=""bibr"">2</xref>]. Among the lncRNAs investigated, nine showed statistically significant differences between WT and SOD1<sup>G93A</sup> animals. Five of them, namely Neat1, Myoparr, Snhg1, Pvt1 and H19, exhibited changes exclusively in the symptomatic stages (P100 and P120); while Gas5 and Snhg16 showed changes in the presymptomatic stage (P60) and became unvariable later on. Of note, Myhas and Malat1 changed their expression pattern throughout the disease course, which could suggest a dual role of these lncRNAs in the disease. When considering the discovery of potential diagnostic biomarkers, none of the molecules displayed significant changes across all the presymptomatic and symptomatic stages. However, Neat1 and H19 remarkably showed the highest fold change at the symptomatic stages, raising them as good candidates for further study in humans as biomarkers to support and/or confirm ALS diagnosis. Furthermore, Pvt1 also showed a notable increase in the late symptomatic stage of the disease in male subjects, which is particularly relevant given the increasing number of articles highlighting sex differences in ALS [<xref rid=""B64"" ref-type=""bibr"">64</xref>,<xref rid=""B65"" ref-type=""bibr"">65</xref>]. This lncRNA might serve as a candidate diagnostic biomarker in men, but also as a potential ALS therapeutic target, as it has been found to be up-regulated in several models of muscle atrophy and impact fundamental processes in skeletal muscle, including mitochondrial respiration and morphology, mito-/autophagy and myofibre size [<xref rid=""B66"" ref-type=""bibr"">66</xref>]. The need for such biomarkers persists today, given the lengthy diagnostic timeline (of over 10 months on average from symptom onset to definitive diagnosis in ALS cases). The development of a comprehensive panel of clinical tests and biomarkers is crucial to improve the differential diagnosis of other ALS-mimicking conditions and thus speed up the current diagnostic process. Interestingly, Neat1 is an essential component of paraspeckles [<xref rid=""B67"" ref-type=""bibr"">67</xref>], intranuclear bodies increased in the spinal cord of sporadic patients and <italic toggle=""yes"">in vitro</italic> models of ALS motor neurons [<xref rid=""B30"" ref-type=""bibr"">30</xref>,<xref rid=""B42"" ref-type=""bibr"">42</xref>]. Paraspeckles are also involved in the regulation of RNA metabolism, the disruption of which is a hallmark of ALS [<xref rid=""B68"" ref-type=""bibr"">68</xref>,<xref rid=""B69"" ref-type=""bibr"">69</xref>]. As for the Neat1-specific role in muscle, <italic toggle=""yes"">in vitro</italic> studies suggest that this lncRNA enhances myoblast proliferation while suppressing differentiation and fusion [<xref rid=""B70"" ref-type=""bibr"">70</xref>]. Consequently, elevated levels of Neat1 could potentially halter muscle regeneration, which is impaired in the disease [<xref rid=""B71"" ref-type=""bibr"">71</xref>–<xref rid=""B73"" ref-type=""bibr"">73</xref>]. The up-regulation of this lncRNA in different forms of the disease (sporadic and familial—associated with mutations in different genes such as FUS and SOD1<sup>G93A</sup>) and in the most affected tissues (motor neurons and skeletal muscle) supports the hypothesis that this lncRNA may be a strong candidate biomarker to aid in diagnosis. Furthermore, a recent study suggests Neat1 as a possible key player in disease progression and genetic modifier of age at onset in ALS [<xref rid=""B34"" ref-type=""bibr"">34</xref>]. Regarding H19, besides being found markedly elevated in SOD1<sup>G93A</sup> mice, serial biopsy samples demonstrated that H19 levels increased as the disease progressed, with a faster rate of increase associated to shorter longevity. These findings suggest a link between H19 levels and muscle damage, with H19 acting either as an indicator of this damage or as a potential contributor to the pathogenesis of the disease. Given that muscle damage reflects ALS progression, H19 might be a valuable prognostic biomarker. Additionally, it might serve as a drug response biomarker to monitor the effectiveness of treatments in slowing or alleviating muscle damage in clinical trials. The role of H19 in adult skeletal muscle is well characterized since in adults this lncRNA is predominantly expressed in this tissue. This lncRNA is described to favour myogenesis and satellite cell-mediated differentiation, enhancing muscle regeneration [<xref rid=""B74"" ref-type=""bibr"">74</xref>]. Besides, it has been associated with glucose metabolism, insulin response and dystrophin stabilization [<xref rid=""B75"" ref-type=""bibr"">75</xref>]. Indeed, H19 levels in this tissue need to be tightly regulated since recent studies suggest that H19 elevated levels may also lead to skeletal muscle atrophy and fibrosis [<xref rid=""B76"" ref-type=""bibr"">76</xref>,<xref rid=""B77"" ref-type=""bibr"">77</xref>]. In light of these findings, H19 may also represent a compelling target for ALS treatment, based on the hypothesis that elevated levels of this lncRNA may contribute to muscle atrophy and skeletal muscle fibrosis, as previously discussed. In addition to H19, three other lncRNAs (Snhg1, Gas5 and Myhas) correlated with longevity in SOD1<sup>G93A</sup> animals. Snhg1 expression was found to be elevated in SOD1<sup>G93A</sup> mice, with a negative correlation with longevity during the terminal phase of the disease in females. The specific role of this lncRNA in skeletal muscle has not been investigated, although current evidence suggests a potential role in myocyte regeneration [<xref rid=""B78"" ref-type=""bibr"">78</xref>–<xref rid=""B80"" ref-type=""bibr"">80</xref>]. Our results indicate that Snhg1 may act as a late agent in disease progression or as an insufficient compensatory mechanism for muscle damage active in the late stages of ALS. In males, animals with a longer lifespan showed higher expression of Gas5 at the early phases of the disease. Since this correlation occurs early in disease course, Gas5 may serve as a good prognostic indicator in males. Consistent with this finding, Gas5 was previously observed to be decreased in presymptomatic SOD1<sup>G93A</sup> male mice as compared with their age- and sex-matched WT littermates. This initial down-regulation observed might be relevant for disease onset and development in males, and could presumably indicate a protective role of Gas5 in muscle. Gas5 has been linked to cell cycle regulation, apoptosis and inflammation, but its role remains controversial since opposite effects have been reported depending on context and tissue [<xref rid=""B81"" ref-type=""bibr"">81</xref>–<xref rid=""B86"" ref-type=""bibr"">86</xref>]. In line with the putative protective role of Gas5 in ALS skeletal muscle, it has been shown that Gas5 is related to the inactivation of NRLP3 inflammasome in cardiac muscle [<xref rid=""B87"" ref-type=""bibr"">87</xref>,<xref rid=""B88"" ref-type=""bibr"">88</xref>]. Therefore, Gas5 down-regulation in males could be related to a hyper-activation of the inflammasome in early stages, which has been previously reported in the skeletal muscle of this animal model and patients with ALS [<xref rid=""B89"" ref-type=""bibr"">89</xref>], in this sex. Interestingly, these differences were observed exclusively in males, who exhibit earlier pathology than females in this animal model. Finally, Myhas levels showed a decreasing pattern throughout the disease, with an initial increase relative to the WT controls during the presymptomatic stage, followed by a subsequent decline in the late stage. Notably, animals with shorter life expectancy exhibited a greater increase in Myhas expression during the early symptomatic stage, resulting in a more abrupt decline. Previous research has evidenced that this lncRNA promotes myogenesis and maintains the fast-twitch phenotype in muscle fibres [<xref rid=""B90"" ref-type=""bibr"">90</xref>]. Accordingly, our results suggest that during the presymptomatic stage, increased levels of Myhas may stimulate satellite cell division, differentiation and fusion into myotubes, thereby maintaining the fast-twitch fibre phenotype, which is more susceptible to degeneration. This hypothesis could explain why animals with a greater increase in this lncRNA during the early symptomatic stage have a shorter life expectancy. Once the compensatory mechanisms aimed at increasing satellite cell proliferation are exhausted, Myhas levels would decline, in turn favouring the shift towards a slower muscle fibre phenotype. This idea would be consistent with the observation that, as ALS progresses, there is a shift towards differentiation into slow twitch muscle fibres (which show greater resistance to denervation) [<xref rid=""B91"" ref-type=""bibr"">91</xref>]. Furthermore, of all the lncRNAs studied, Myhas demonstrated the greatest potential to discriminate between <italic toggle=""yes"">short-</italic> and <italic toggle=""yes"">long-term survival</italic> groups. These results not only suggest a potential role for Myhas in the pathophysiology of muscle in ALS, but also propose it as a promising prognostic biomarker. This article points out lncRNAs as valuable players in the pathophysiology of ALS muscle. Further research will be needed to unravel their detrimental or protective role in the disease, as well as the putative pathways involved. Moreover, the reported Myhas and H19 correlation with longevity opens the path to further evaluate their potential as prognostic and drug response biomarkers in human patients and be used as promising therapeutic targets to delay disease progression and prolong lifespan.",N/A,10 2024
"Exercise, disease state and sex influence the beneficial effects of Fn14-depletion on survival and muscle pathology in the <italic toggle=""yes"">SOD1</italic><sup><italic toggle=""yes"">G93A</italic></sup> amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) mouse model",,"Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a devastating and currently incurable neurodegenerative disease. Once symptomatic, the median survival of patients is usually between 3 and 5 years. Clinical manifestations typically occur in mid-life, followed by the rapid and progressive wasting of muscles and subsequent paralysis [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR1"">1</xref>]. ALS can be sporadic (~ 80%) or familial (~ 20%) [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR2"">2</xref>], and in the latter case can be caused by numerous genetic mutations with the most common being in <italic toggle=""yes"">chromosome 9 open reading frame 72</italic> (<italic toggle=""yes"">C9ORF72</italic>) [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR3"">3</xref>, <xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR4"">4</xref>], <italic toggle=""yes"">superoxide dismutase 1</italic> (<italic toggle=""yes"">SOD1</italic>) [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR5"">5</xref>], <italic toggle=""yes"">Fused in Sarcoma</italic> (<italic toggle=""yes"">FUS</italic>) [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR6"">6</xref>, <xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR7"">7</xref>] and <italic toggle=""yes"">TAR DNA-binding protein 43</italic> (<italic toggle=""yes"">TDP-43</italic>) [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR8"">8</xref>–<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR10"">10</xref>]. Both sporadic and familial ALS patients present similar symptoms and pathophysiology. While the primary pathological target of ALS is undeniably the motor neurons (both upper and lower), accumulating evidence strongly suggests that intrinsic muscle defects exist and contribute to disease progression and presentation [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR11"">11</xref>]. Indeed, the muscle-restricted expression of mutant SOD1 results in a canonical ALS pathophysiology [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR12"">12</xref>, <xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR13"">13</xref>]. Furthermore, aberrant genetic, biochemical, developmental, regulatory and physiological changes prior to, or accompanying, motor neuron loss are observed in ALS muscle and progenitor cells [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR11"">11</xref>]. As muscle plays an important role in maintaining systemic energy homeostasis [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR14"">14</xref>], intrinsic muscle defects can have severe consequences on whole-body metabolic homeostasis. Interestingly, instances of insulin resistance [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR15"">15</xref>], hyperlipidemia [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR16"">16</xref>], hyperglycemia [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR17"">17</xref>], aberrant fatty acid metabolism [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR18"">18</xref>], hyperglucagonemia [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR19"">19</xref>], glucose intolerance [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR18"">18</xref>] and development of diabetes [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR20"">20</xref>] have all been reported in ALS patients and animal models. Furthermore both dietary and exercise interventions, which are direct modulators of muscle metabolism [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR21"">21</xref>], have been demonstrated to impact disease progression in ALS patients and animal models [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR22"">22</xref>–<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR24"">24</xref>]. Thus, uncovering and targeting pathological molecular effectors in ALS muscle may lead to tissue-specific and whole-body improvements [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR11"">11</xref>, <xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR25"">25</xref>, <xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR26"">26</xref>]. One important pathway that contributes to skeletal muscle health, function and metabolism is controlled by the binding of the tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-like weak inducer of apoptosis (TWEAK) ligand to the TNF fibroblast growth factor inducible 14 (Fn14) receptor [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR27"">27</xref>, <xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR28"">28</xref>]. Interestingly, the TWEAK/Fn14 pathway can impact muscle positively or negatively depending on the levels of TWEAK present. High levels are typically associated with detrimental effects while low levels have a beneficial impact [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR27"">27</xref>, <xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR28"">28</xref>]. Similarly, Fn14 expression is typically very low in healthy muscle and becomes upregulated in muscle atrophy conditions, which can lead to sustained muscle pathology if not restored to normal levels [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR27"">27</xref>, <xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR28"">28</xref>]. Furthermore, TWEAK and Fn14 have both been implicated in the regulation of key muscle metabolic effectors such as peroxisome proliferative activated receptor, gamma, coactivator 1 alpha (PGC-1α), Slc2a4 solute carrier family 2, member 4 (GLUT4), hexokinase 2 (HKII) and Krüppel-like transcription factor 15 (KLF15) [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR29"">29</xref>]. What still remains unclear however, is the potential role of the TWEAK/Fn14 pathway in neuromuscular conditions, where chronic muscle wasting occurs due to motor neuron loss and muscle denervation [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR30"">30</xref>]. In an attempt to explore this further, we have previously investigated the TWEAK/Fn14 signalling cascade in mouse models of ALS and spinal muscular atrophy (SMA), a childhood neuromuscular disease [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR31"">31</xref>]. In pre-weaned SMA mice, we observed a significant downregulation of <italic toggle=""yes"">Tweak</italic> and <italic toggle=""yes"">Fn14</italic> in various skeletal muscles during disease progression, accompanied by the expected dysregulation of <italic toggle=""yes"">PGC-1α</italic>, <italic toggle=""yes"">Glut4</italic>, <italic toggle=""yes"">HKII</italic> and <italic toggle=""yes"">Klf15</italic> [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR32"">32</xref>]. Interestingly, administering Fc-TWEAK, an agonist of the pathway, to SMA mice, improved several canonical disease phenotypes [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR32"">32</xref>]. Conversely, we have previously observed that <italic toggle=""yes"">Tweak</italic> and <italic toggle=""yes"">Fn14</italic> are significantly upregulated in skeletal muscle of <italic toggle=""yes"">SOD1</italic><sup><italic toggle=""yes"">G93A</italic></sup> ALS mice during disease progression [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR33"">33</xref>]. While antagonising TWEAK, either genetically or pharmacologically, did not impact survival, we did observe positive effects in skeletal muscle [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR33"">33</xref>]. Since the receptor has been proposed as the main effector of the TWEAK/Fn14 pathway activity [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR34"">34</xref>] and that Fn14 can act independently from TWEAK in muscle [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR35"">35</xref>], it is possible that manipulating Fn14 instead of TWEAK in the <italic toggle=""yes"">SOD1</italic><sup><italic toggle=""yes"">G93A</italic></sup> ALS mice could lead to differential and/or improved benefits. In this study, we investigated the effect of Fn14 depletion on disease progression and muscle pathology in <italic toggle=""yes"">SOD1</italic><sup><italic toggle=""yes"">G93A</italic></sup> ALS mice by crossing Fn14 knockout mice (<italic toggle=""yes"">Fn14</italic><sup><italic toggle=""yes"">−/−</italic></sup>) with the <italic toggle=""yes"">SOD1</italic><sup><italic toggle=""yes"">G93A</italic></sup> mouse model. We confirmed that the TWEAK/Fn14 pathway is dysregulated in the skeletal muscle of <italic toggle=""yes"">SOD1</italic><sup><italic toggle=""yes"">G93A</italic></sup> mice. We then showed that Fn14-depleted <italic toggle=""yes"">SOD1</italic><sup><italic toggle=""yes"">G93A</italic></sup> mice had an increased lifespan and decreased muscle pathology, which was dependent on exposure to exercise and sex. Our study provides further insights into the different roles of the TWEAK/Fn14 pathway in skeletal muscle and how they may be influenced by age, disease, sex and exercise.   In this study, we aimed to better understand how increased Fn14 expression in an ALS mouse model with chronic denervation and muscle wasting could contribute to muscle pathology and disease progression. To achieve this, we genetically deleted <italic toggle=""yes"">Fn14</italic> in both WT and <italic toggle=""yes"">SOD1</italic><sup><italic toggle=""yes"">G93A</italic></sup> mice and observed behavioural, molecular and histological changes that were dependent on exercise, sex and disease progression. In the first instance, we not only confirmed our previous observation of increased expression of Fn14 in the skeletal muscle of <italic toggle=""yes"">SOD1</italic><sup><italic toggle=""yes"">G93A</italic></sup> ALS mice during disease progression [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR33"">33</xref>], but we also validated the previously reported negative correlation between the activity of the TWEAK/Fn14 pathway and the expression of the known molecular and metabolic effectors <italic toggle=""yes"">Glut4</italic>, <italic toggle=""yes"">Klf15</italic>, <italic toggle=""yes"">HKII</italic> and <italic toggle=""yes"">PGC-1</italic>α [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR29"">29</xref>]<italic toggle=""yes"">.</italic> Interestingly, we recently demonstrated a similar but inverse negative correlation in the skeletal muscle of another neuromuscular mouse model, SMA mice, whereby the expression levels of <italic toggle=""yes"">Tweak</italic> and <italic toggle=""yes"">Fn14</italic> decreased during disease progression while those of <italic toggle=""yes"">Glut4</italic>, <italic toggle=""yes"">Klf15</italic>, <italic toggle=""yes"">HKII</italic> and <italic toggle=""yes"">PGC-1</italic>α increased [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR32"">32</xref>]. One important distinction between these two studies is the developmental stage investigated. Indeed, SMA mice were of pre-weaned age [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR32"">32</xref>] while the <italic toggle=""yes"">SOD1</italic><sup><italic toggle=""yes"">G93A</italic></sup> ALS mice were at adult stages (current study), suggesting that the TWEAK/Fn14 signalling pathway is differentially regulated at different stages of muscle development. This differential regulation might have an impact on downstream metabolic requirements and regulation as well as therapeutic interventions in cases of dysregulation. One of our key findings is the extended lifespan of Fn14-depleted <italic toggle=""yes"">SOD1</italic><sup><italic toggle=""yes"">G93A</italic></sup> ALS mice, which is contrary to the absence of impact following genetic <italic toggle=""yes"">Tweak</italic> deletion in the same mouse model, which we have previously reported [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR33"">33</xref>]. This suggest that the detrimental effect of the aberrant activity of the TWEAK/Fn14 pathway in skeletal muscle of <italic toggle=""yes"">SOD1</italic><sup><italic toggle=""yes"">G93A</italic></sup> ALS mice is driven by the receptor (Fn14) and not the ligand (TWEAK). This aligns with previous work that points to a greater role for Fn14 than TWEAK in enabling pathway activity [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR34"">34</xref>]. It is also possible that the differential impacts observed in TWEAK- and Fn14-depleted <italic toggle=""yes"">SOD1</italic><sup><italic toggle=""yes"">G93A</italic></sup> ALS mice are due to Fn14-independent TWEAK signalling [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR56"">56</xref>] and/or TWEAK-independent Fn14 signalling [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR57"">57</xref>]. Furthermore, the distinct effects of TWEAK and Fn14 depletion in <italic toggle=""yes"">SOD1</italic><sup><italic toggle=""yes"">G93A</italic></sup> ALS mice could further be caused by their known roles in other tissues such as the heart, gastrointestinal tract, kidney, liver, central nervous system and epithelium [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR58"">58</xref>–<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR60"">60</xref>]. As the genetic knock-out of TWEAK and Fn14 was systemic in both cases, we cannot exclude additional benefits or detrimental effects stemming from altered function in other cells and tissues. Regardless of the reasons, our combined studies point to a greater therapeutic value in modulating Fn14 over TWEAK. In addition to lifespan, we also observed improvements in skeletal muscle pathology at molecular and histological levels in Fn14-depleted <italic toggle=""yes"">SOD1</italic><sup><italic toggle=""yes"">G93A</italic></sup> mice. These changes did not occur in <italic toggle=""yes"">Fn14</italic><sup><italic toggle=""yes"">−/−</italic></sup> mice when compared to WT animals, suggesting that the effects were dependent on disease stage. Interestingly, we have previously shown increased muscle fibre and NMJ endplate sizes in TWEAK-depleted <italic toggle=""yes"">SOD1</italic><sup><italic toggle=""yes"">G93A</italic></sup> ALS mice [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR33"">33</xref>], further supporting a role for the TWEAK/Fn14 pathway in muscle pathology in this mouse model and in more general adult denervation-induced muscle atrophy [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR34"">34</xref>]. Of note is that in both TWEAK- and Fn14-depleted <italic toggle=""yes"">SOD1</italic><sup><italic toggle=""yes"">G93A</italic></sup> ALS mice, there were no significant improvements in motor function [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR33"">33</xref>], suggesting that simply targeting the TWEAK/Fn14 pathway is not sufficient for the recovery of the neuromuscular unit. Surprisingly, the beneficial impact of Fn14 depletion on the survival of <italic toggle=""yes"">SOD1</italic><sup><italic toggle=""yes"">G93A</italic></sup> ALS mice was almost masked when the mice underwent weekly rotarod and grid test assessments for approximately 16 weeks as the enhanced physical activity itself had a positive impact on survival of the <italic toggle=""yes"">SOD1</italic><sup><italic toggle=""yes"">G93A</italic></sup> ALS mice. Interestingly, there are reports of both beneficial and detrimental effects of exercise in ALS mouse models and patients that suggest that exercise regimen (type and length) and sex are important factors that contribute to the observed outcomes [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR61"">61</xref>–<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR65"">65</xref>]. In our study, short weekly bouts of grid test and rotarod were sufficient to improve survival. Further investigations showed that the combination of 5 consecutive days of exercise (rotarod or grid test) and Fn14 depletion was sufficient to induce changes at molecular and histological levels in the skeletal muscle of 12-week-old animals. These changes were dependent on disease stage, exercise and sex. Combining exercise and Fn14 depletion may therefore lead to potentially, additive, synergistic and/or antagonistic interactions that may be dependent on the exercise regimen itself and individual characteristics. However, in our study, we did not identify clear commonalities between Fn14 depletion and exercises that would point to shared mechanisms. Furthermore, the results of some analyses such as myofiber size and expression of atrogenes did not necessarily align with the increased survival in Fn14-depleted and exercised <italic toggle=""yes"">SOD1</italic><sup><italic toggle=""yes"">G93A</italic></sup> mice, suggesting more complex and possibly multi-systemic mechanisms that influence overall disease progression in these mice. One key observation was that changes in <italic toggle=""yes"">Tweak</italic> and <italic toggle=""yes"">Fn14</italic> expression appeared dependent on the type of exercise, sex and genotype of the animal. For example, <italic toggle=""yes"">Fn14</italic> levels displayed a differential expression in <italic toggle=""yes"">SOD1</italic><sup><italic toggle=""yes"">G93A</italic></sup> males only, whereby it was increased following rotarod and decreased following the grid test. Conversely, in females, <italic toggle=""yes"">Fn14</italic> levels specifically increased in WT mice following both rotarod and grid test, when compared to unexercised animals. These diverse patterns may reflect the complex metabolic adaptations impacted by disease, Fn14 presence/absence, sex and type of exercise. Typically, endurance exercises promote the use of aerobic/oxidative metabolic pathways in skeletal muscle while resistance exercises favour anaerobic/glycolytic metabolic pathways [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR66"">66</xref>]. In ALS, skeletal muscle metabolism during rest and exercise is altered in both pre-clinical models and patients [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR67"">67</xref>–<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR70"">70</xref>], which could alter how ALS muscle adapts to different types of exercises and the overall beneficial vs detrimental outcomes [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR62"">62</xref>, <xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR63"">63</xref>]. As for Fn14, it is typically increased in skeletal muscle of healthy individuals and adult mice following exercise, irrespective of type (endurance vs resistance) [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR71"">71</xref>–<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR74"">74</xref>]. Conversely, the muscle-specific deletion of Fn14 and the ubiquitous TWEAK deletion in mice both improved exercise capacity and oxidative metabolism [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR75"">75</xref>, <xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR76"">76</xref>], suggesting that sustained and/or aberrant increase in TWEAK/Fn14 activity expression during exercise may be detrimental. It is therefore unclear why the expression of both the ligand and effector are commonly reported as being elevated following exercise. Of note, we only observed changes in <italic toggle=""yes"">Fn14</italic> expression in exercised WT female mice in our study, which may be due to our selected exercise regimens (length and type of exercise). Nevertheless, our results, combined with previous studies, suggest and support a complex interaction between Fn14 regulation, disease state, exercise and the metabolic status of muscle. Another noticeable result is the influence of genotype, sex and exercise on the expression of the atrogenes <italic toggle=""yes"">MuRF-1</italic> and <italic toggle=""yes"">Atrogin-1</italic>. For example, we found that the expression of <italic toggle=""yes"">MuRF-1</italic> is significantly elevated in <italic toggle=""yes"">SOD1</italic><sup><italic toggle=""yes"">G93A</italic></sup> males following both the rotarod and grid test, supporting previous studies on the negative impact of exercise in ALS patients [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR63"">63</xref>, <xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR77"">77</xref>]. In <italic toggle=""yes"">SOD1</italic><sup><italic toggle=""yes"">G93A</italic></sup><italic toggle=""yes"">;Fn14</italic><sup><italic toggle=""yes"">−/−</italic></sup> males, <italic toggle=""yes"">MuRF-1</italic> levels remained low in both rotarod and grid test groups, aligning with the previous report of reduced neurogenic muscle atrophy in muscle-specific Fn14-depleted animals [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR75"">75</xref>]. However, in females, <italic toggle=""yes"">MuRF-1</italic> expression was significantly increased in WT mice only following the rotarod and all experimental groups after the grid test. While the differential expression patterns of both atrogenes might appear contradictory, previous studies have demonstrated that their regulation can be controlled by distinct pathways and in a sex-dependent fashion [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR78"">78</xref>–<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR82"">82</xref>]. Of note, our analysis of muscle fibres shows an absence of perfect correlation between the expression of atrogenes and myofiber size, suggesting that changes in <italic toggle=""yes"">MuRF-1</italic> and <italic toggle=""yes"">Atrogin-1</italic> are not sufficient to improve muscle size and that other molecular effectors and regulatory pathways may be responsible for modulating muscle mass [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR83"">83</xref>]. Indeed, Fn14 has previously been demonstrated to modulate myoblast fusion [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR84"">84</xref>, <xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR85"">85</xref>], a process that contributes to muscle size growth during regeneration, which typically occurs following bouts of exercise. As such, Fn14 depletion may have affected myofiber size in a subset of our rotarod- and grid test-trained animals. The expression of molecular and metabolic effectors previously shown to be regulated by TWEAK/Fn14 signalling also appear to be dependent on genotype, sex and type of exercise. For example, <italic toggle=""yes"">PGC-1α</italic> expression was upregulated in both the rotarod- and grid test-trained <italic toggle=""yes"">SOD1</italic><sup><italic toggle=""yes"">G93A</italic></sup> males and Fn14 depletion restored the levels to normal only in the grid-test exercised <italic toggle=""yes"">SOD1</italic><sup><italic toggle=""yes"">G93A</italic></sup><italic toggle=""yes"">;Fn14</italic><sup><italic toggle=""yes"">−/−</italic></sup> mice. In females however, <italic toggle=""yes"">PGC-1α</italic> levels were significantly elevated in rotarod- and grid-test trained WT animals and Fn14 depletion restored the levels to normal only in the rotarod-trained WT females. These differential patterns and relationships between genotype, exercise, sex and metabolic effectors most likely result from the combination of different metabolic pathways favoured by different types of exercise [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR66"">66</xref>], as well as the impact of ALS-causing mutations and sex on muscle metabolism [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR67"">67</xref>–<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR70"">70</xref>, <xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR86"">86</xref>, <xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR87"">87</xref>]. Indeed, the previously reported role of the TWEAK/Fn14 pathway in the regulation of PGC-1α and mitochondrial content in skeletal muscle [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR88"">88</xref>] may have contributed to our PGC-1a observations with added influences from sex, genotype and exercise that still need to be explored. MyHC isoforms IIa, IIx and IIb are specific to fast twitch skeletal muscles such as the TA and they each confer distinct metabolic and functional properties to skeletal muscle fibres [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR89"">89</xref>]. Furthermore, skeletal muscle can adapt rapidly to metabolic changes induced by exercise, which can be reflected by altered MyHC expression [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR90"">90</xref>]. In our study, we indeed observed some changes in MyHC isoform expression that were dependent on exercise type, genotype and sex, suggesting that the different combinations of these factors had distinct effects on the properties of skeletal muscle. In some instances (e.g. grid test-trained <italic toggle=""yes"">SOD1</italic><sup><italic toggle=""yes"">G93A</italic></sup><italic toggle=""yes"">;Fn14</italic><sup><italic toggle=""yes"">−/−</italic></sup> males), changes in the same direction of more than one MyHC isoform was observed, a phenomenon previously reported following a short bout of exercise [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR91"">91</xref>]. Finally, our analyses of myofiber size further emphasized the differential responses of skeletal muscle from females and males to types of exercise, disease state and Fn14 depletion. In fact, throughout our molecular and histological analyses, sex-dependent differences were observed. These align with previous studies showing the effect of sex on responses to exercise [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR80"">80</xref>, <xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR81"">81</xref>, <xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR87"">87</xref>], in <italic toggle=""yes"">Fn14</italic><sup><italic toggle=""yes"">−/−</italic></sup> mice exposed to neonatal hypoxia–ischemia [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR92"">92</xref>], on general muscle properties [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR93"">93</xref>], on expression of MyHC isoforms [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR94"">94</xref>] and on disease onset and response to exercise in <italic toggle=""yes"">SOD1</italic><sup><italic toggle=""yes"">G93A</italic></sup> mice [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR95"">95</xref>]. All of these extrinsic and intrinsic factors are therefore important to consider when assessing skeletal muscle adaptations in ALS. While our work provides some interesting insights, it is important to note its key limitations. Firstly, the impact of exercise on <italic toggle=""yes"">SOD1</italic><sup><italic toggle=""yes"">G93A</italic></sup><italic toggle=""yes"">;Fn14</italic><sup><italic toggle=""yes"">−/−</italic></sup> mice was observed in animals that performed both types of exercise weekly from 8 weeks of age to humane endpoint. However, the rotarod and grid test experiments were done separately on 12-week-old animals for 1 week only. Furthermore, our study focused on the known metabolic effectors downstream of TWEAK and Fn14, which means that additional genes and signalling cascades could be impacted by exercise, sex and/or genotype and contribute to our observed results. Finally, our research was aimed at investigating skeletal muscle but as Fn14 depletion is systemic, some of the beneficial and detrimental effects reported may be due to other cells and tissues. Our study provides additional insights on the role of the TWEAK/Fn14 pathway in a denervation-induced muscle pathology as modelled in the <italic toggle=""yes"">SOD1</italic><sup><italic toggle=""yes"">G93A</italic></sup> ALS mice. Importantly, we demonstrate that the benefits of Fn14 depletion are impacted by exercise and sex. This is particularly relevant in the context of the current therapeutic landscape of the ALS field, where combinatorial therapies that include exercise regimens are being explored by many research and clinical teams. As such, a better understanding and consideration of the interactions between treatments, muscle metabolism, exercise and sex will be of importance in future studies.

"Automated pipeline for denoising, missing data processing, and feature extraction for signals acquired via wearable devices in multiple sclerosis and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis applications",,"Multiple Sclerosis (MS) and Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) are chronic conditions characterized by a progressive decline in motor and cognitive neurological functions. Although they are distinct diseases, they present similar challenges for patients and the healthcare system (<xref rid=""B1"" ref-type=""bibr"">1</xref>). Individuals with either condition must transition between receiving care in clinical facilities and managing daily care at home to monitor disease progression and treat acute episodes. This constant physical and psychological burden, coupled with an uncertain future, is shared by both patient groups. Clinicians, on the other hand, require tools that can effectively support patients with ALS and MS by providing personalized therapeutic decisions based on the patient’s conditions, identifying critical interventions, and providing insight into the status of the disease and the overall clinical situation. In recent years, significant efforts have been made to estimate the progression of ALS and MS and to develop tools that can assist both patients and clinicians in managing the disease (<xref rid=""B2"" ref-type=""bibr"">2</xref>, <xref rid=""B3"" ref-type=""bibr"">3</xref>). BRAINTEASER (BRinging Artificial INTelligencE home for a better cAre of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and multiple SclERosis) (www.brainteaser.health) is a project funded by the European Horizon 2020 initiative, which aims to deploy Artificial Intelligence (AI)-based technologies for the daily home care of MS and ALS. In this context, AI is considered a key element in meeting the needs of both patients and clinicians. Specifically, AI methodologies can be utilized to analyze the progression of MS and ALS, allowing for the capture and handling of patients’ inter-variability, and providing tools for forecasting disease evolution (<xref rid=""B4"" ref-type=""bibr"">4</xref>). For AI methods to be effective, they need to be trained on large quantities of heterogeneous data from various sources, such as patient-specific medical history, environmental data, and signals potentially derived from commercially available wearable devices. Currently, wearable devices are widely available and they are becoming an essential instrument to monitor patients’ health-related signals in an almost continuous, noninvasive, and painless way, moving the collection process from limited controlled in-clinic sessions to daily life. Among wearable devices, commercial smartwatches allow users to easily track several important signals such as heart rate, step counts, physical exercise, and pulse oximetry, which can be used to evaluate the general health condition of the wearer (<xref rid=""B5"" ref-type=""bibr"">5</xref>). These functionalities can be particularly beneficial for patients with chronic diseases, who can use them to monitor the status of their disease, while clinicians can utilize these data to gain insight into disease progression. However, there are two main problems with using commercially available smartwatches to collect health-related signals. The first is that these health signals often cannot be directly used as provided by the device, mainly because of the noise of collected signals and elements tied to the use of the device itself. In fact, the wearer’s movement during usage might lead to artifacts in the signals, in the form of spikes, high-frequency noise, or gaps. Moreover, the device must be user-friendly and with an appropriate form factor, to avoid dropouts in use, thus ensuring continuous data collection. Finally, the device battery has to be recharged periodically, inevitably leading to data loss in that specific period. The second problem is that clinically relevant features, essential for monitoring chronic diseases such as ALS and MS, are not currently available through these devices. To solve these problems, many solutions have been proposed in the literature to process and analyze wearable data, but most of them have been applied only to non-consumer/experimental devices or to signals with different characteristics than the one collectible from consumer wearable devices like smartwatches (<xref rid=""B6"" ref-type=""bibr"">6</xref>, <xref rid=""B7"" ref-type=""bibr"">7</xref>). Some previous works have focused on the processing of wearable data. For example, the works by Beyer et al. (<xref rid=""B8"" ref-type=""bibr"">8</xref>) and Vega et al. (<xref rid=""B9"" ref-type=""bibr"">9</xref>) present two processing pipelines for various wearabale devices, but lack the support for the Garmin Vivoactive 4 smartwatch, used for the project. Others like the works by Bent et al. (<xref rid=""B10"" ref-type=""bibr"">10</xref>) do not support all the required signals or don’t extract the features needed for the study. Lastly, the work by Foell et al. (<xref rid=""B11"" ref-type=""bibr"">11</xref>), while supporting the specific device, requires the data to be in the raw extracted format, which was not available during the project. Therefore, this work aims to present the automated pipeline to process health-related signals and extract clinically relevant features for ALS and MS that we developed within the BRAINTEASER project, in which signals are acquired via Garmin Vivoactive 4 smartwatch. Our solution has been meticulously crafted to meet the distinct needs, peculiarities, and requirements of the BRAINTEASER project. Briefly, the automated pipeline is composed of two steps: the signal processing step applies retiming, gap filling and denoising algorithms to improve data quality, whereas the feature extraction step selects the most important variables for ALS and MS according to clinical partners’ knowledge and feedback. The proposed automated pipeline, developed in Python, can be of help to researchers for the preliminary automated processing of the large amount of data that can be collected from wearable devices and can be easily adapted/modified to suit the specific needs of each scenario. The structure of the paper is the following. We will start by presenting the BRAINTEASER project and its aims, and the rationale behind the selection of the Garmin Vivoactive 4 smartwatch and, by exploiting the feedback received from the clinical teams in the project, we will show the procedure we applied to identify the most useful signals and features. Then, we will illustrate in detail the automated pipeline we developed to obtain signals with improved quality and extract relevant features for AI-based models employed in BRAINTEASER. Finally, we will conclude by thoroughly defining all the extracted features, and in the last section, we will present the effectiveness of the automated pipeline by evaluating the result of its application to pivotal beta testing sessions.  The pipeline for signal processing and feature extraction has been validated using sample data collected during the project’s development period and the initial phase of patient enrollment. This data was obtained from 10 subjects participating in the BRAINTEASER clinical trial, including both ALS and MS patients. The subjects wore the Garmin Vivoactive 4s device in an outpatient setting without any specific tasks for data collection. The subjects gave their informed consent for inclusion before they participated in the study. The study was conducted following the Declaration of Helsinki, and the protocol was approved by the Ethics Committee of A.O.U. Città della salute e della scienza di Torino (314/2021). In this work, we present the results on a representative subject with ALS, who used the device for 7 days to acquire a comprehensive data set that encompasses both daytime and nighttime periods. During this period, this individual engaged in various physical activities, which enabled the verification of the collected data’s quality and the assessment of the efficiency of the processing pipeline in eliminating potential artifacts resulting from the device’s movement on the wrist. The data presented here, as well as additional sample data, can be found in the repository linked as <xref rid=""s10"" ref-type=""sec"">Supplementary Material</xref>. This data is representative of future datasets that will be collected using the wearable device, during the BRAINTEASER clinical trial and the pipeline will be further tested on the complete dataset when available. The sample dataset contains some of the expected artifacts that the processing pipeline is asked to remove/correct. For instance, the sleeping time signal presents some peaks that could be a consequence of the wrong positioning of the device or compression of the sensor due to movement during sleep. Moreover, all signals present data gaps of different durations, which need to be identified and filled by linear interpolation if the gap duration is lower or equal to the limits previously. The results of the signal processing pipeline, comprising the initial three blocks outlined in <xref rid=""F1"" ref-type=""fig"">Figure 1</xref>, are illustrated in <xref rid=""F2"" ref-type=""fig"">Figure 2</xref> for heart rate (top), <inline-formula><math xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML""><mi xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"">Sp</mi><msub xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML""><mi xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"">O</mi><mn xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"">2</mn></msub></math></inline-formula> (middle), and respiration (bottom) signals. Each figure depicts a segment of the available data to demonstrate the effects of each processing step. The input retimed signal is represented by the blue dashed line, the outcome of gap filling is displayed as green dots, and the denoised signal is depicted in red. These results illustrate the varying susceptibility of different signals to artifacts. Specifically, the heart rate signal obtained from the wearable device was found to be suitable for feature extraction without the need for further processing. Conversely, the <inline-formula><math xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML""><mi xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"">Sp</mi><msub xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML""><mi xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"">O</mi><mn xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"">2</mn></msub></math></inline-formula> and respiration rate signals exhibited a significant number of missing data points and artifacts, requiring pre-processing prior to feature extraction. The proposed automatic processing pipeline demonstrates the capability to effectively identify and correct the prevalent issues in health-related signals obtained from wearable devices. The results presented in <xref rid=""F2"" ref-type=""fig"">Figure 2</xref> illustrate that the application of the signal processing steps leads to an enhancement in the usability of the acquired time-series, and subsequently, the quality of the extracted features. This is achieved through the reconstruction of missing data and the removal of artifacts through denoising. The cleaned sample was utilized to extract sample features that will serve as input to the AI models. As an example, <xref rid=""T8"" ref-type=""table"">Table 8</xref> presents a list of sample features that were extracted from the heart rate signal. <xref rid=""T9"" ref-type=""table"">Tables 9</xref> and <xref rid=""T10"" ref-type=""table"">10</xref> show an example of the features extracted from the sleeping time signals. These focus on overall summary values and, especially for the <inline-formula><math xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML""><mi xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"">Sp</mi><msub xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML""><mi xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"">O</mi><mn xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"">2</mn></msub></math></inline-formula> signal, some of the features highlight important events such as time in desaturation and its characteristics. In this study, the validity and impact of the extracted features on model performance have not been directly evaluated. This evaluation is important to understand the effect of the pipeline on model performance. However, such an analysis would necessitate the complete development of dedicated ALS/MS models to fully leverage the features extracted by our pipeline, which is a matter of ongoing research and is out of the scope of the present manuscript. Of course, once these models are finalized within the framework of the BRAINTEASER project, future investigations will explore the impact of our processing and feature extraction steps on their performance. Health signals obtained from wearable devices present a valuable source of monitoring data for chronic diseases, and AI models can leverage this information to predict disease progression. In the context of the BRAINTEASER project, the Garmin Vivoactive 4 was selected as the device for training the AI models for monitoring the progression of MS and ALS. This paper presents the processing pipeline developed and intended for deployment in the BRAINTEASER project. This pipeline incorporates state-of-the-art techniques and addresses the requirements for analyzing these signals in a real-world consumer scenario. While numerous current techniques concentrate on high-frequency data obtained from specialized and case-specific sensors, this approach utilizes a readily accessible consumer device and their built-in sensors and features, such as optical sensors and pulse-oximeters. During the development and signal selection process, it was crucial to incorporate input from clinicians to ensure the extraction of necessary features and focus on the most relevant signals for the specific situation. The selection process also considered additional engineering and usability factors. However, as a result, the accelerometer data was discarded. It is worth noting that the readings from the accelerometer can be valuable for a variety of functionality assessments, particularly those related to motor skills. This interdisciplinary approach is of paramount importance to guarantee that the processing is performed on valuable signals for the specific case. This process results in the extraction of useful features that can be utilized in subsequent analysis steps or, for example, displayed in a monitoring interface. The proposed pipeline has been developed to work on data covering one day, but it can also process data in shorter time windows. However, when using shorter time windows, the consistency of certain features should be ensured the consistency of certain features. Regardless of the time window, patterns over multiple days can be analyzed at a later stage by comparing the extracted features and metrics as necessary. The proposed pipeline will be implemented in the BRAINTEASER project and continuously refined to meet the specific requirements of its application in the project. Future work will involve examining the noise characteristics of data obtained from wearable devices and evaluating various advanced noise-filtering approaches. One possible approach is to utilize Kalman filtering, as investigated in the study cited in (<xref rid=""B35"" ref-type=""bibr"">35</xref>), to assess its potential to enhance the heart rate signal in this processing pipeline. Additionally, new features will be explored and developed to expand the capabilities of the pipeline beyond the current processing task. One specific area of improvement is the gap-filling technique, particularly in sleep-related signals. By using Bayesian approaches based on imputation of earlier periods, it may be possible to take into account patient habits and routines, which could enable the development of a priori information that is relevant for both imputation and long-term statistics. This could allow for better exploration of signal patterns, and more accurate analysis of the signals. Furthermore, the long-term statistics generated by the pipeline could provide a deeper understanding of the signals and could potentially aid in the detection of outliers, which may indicate significant health events. The developed pipeline is a useful tool for effectively utilizing consumer smartwatches in health monitoring, and it might enable improved monitoring and signal analysis of both sick and healthy individuals in various scenarios.",N/A,27 9 2024
"Hippocampal aggregation signatures of pathogenic <italic toggle=""yes"">UBQLN2</italic> in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and frontotemporal dementia","Pathogenic variants in the <italic toggle=""yes"">UBQLN2</italic> gene cause X-linked dominant amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and/or frontotemporal dementia characterized by ubiquilin 2 aggregates in neurons of the motor cortex, hippocampus and spinal cord. However, ubiquilin 2 neuropathology is also seen in sporadic and familial amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and/or frontotemporal dementia cases not caused by <italic toggle=""yes"">UBQLN2</italic> pathogenic variants, particularly <italic toggle=""yes"">C9orf72</italic>-linked cases. This makes the mechanistic role of mutant ubiquilin 2 protein and the value of ubiquilin 2 pathology for predicting genotype unclear. Here we examine a cohort of 44 genotypically diverse amyotrophic lateral sclerosis cases with or without frontotemporal dementia, including eight cases with <italic toggle=""yes"">UBQLN2</italic> variants [resulting in p.S222G, p.P497H, p.P506S, p.T487I (two cases) and p.P497L (three cases)]. Using multiplexed (five-label) fluorescent immunohistochemistry, we mapped the co-localization of ubiquilin 2 with phosphorylated TDP-43, dipeptide repeat aggregates and p62 in the hippocampus of controls (<italic toggle=""yes"">n</italic> = 6), or amyotrophic lateral sclerosis with or without frontotemporal dementia in sporadic (<italic toggle=""yes"">n</italic> = 20), unknown familial (<italic toggle=""yes"">n</italic> = 3), <italic toggle=""yes"">SOD1</italic>-linked (<italic toggle=""yes"">n</italic> = 1), <italic toggle=""yes"">FUS</italic>-linked (<italic toggle=""yes"">n</italic> = 1), <italic toggle=""yes"">C9orf72</italic>-linked (<italic toggle=""yes"">n</italic> = 5) and <italic toggle=""yes"">UBQLN2</italic>-linked (<italic toggle=""yes"">n</italic> = 8) cases. We differentiate between (i) ubiquilin 2 aggregation together with phosphorylated TDP-43 or dipeptide repeat proteins; and (ii) ubiquilin 2 self-aggregation promoted by <italic toggle=""yes"">UBQLN2</italic> pathogenic variants that cause amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and/or frontotemporal dementia. Overall, we describe a hippocampal protein aggregation signature that fully distinguishes mutant from wild-type ubiquilin 2 in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis with or without frontotemporal dementia, whereby mutant ubiquilin 2 is more prone than wild-type to aggregate independently of driving factors. This neuropathological signature can be used to assess the pathogenicity of <italic toggle=""yes"">UBQLN2</italic> gene variants and to understand the mechanisms of <italic toggle=""yes"">UBQLN2</italic>-linked disease. Mutations in <italic toggle=""yes"">UBQLN2</italic> cause X-linked dominant ALS and/or FTD marked by the presence of ubiquilin 2 aggregates. However, ubiquilin 2 neuropathology is also seen in ALS/FTD cases unrelated to <italic toggle=""yes"">UBQLN2</italic> mutations.

<italic toggle=""yes"">UBQLN2</italic> pathogenic variants are a rare cause of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) with or without dementia, and the only known causal variants on the X-chromosome. <italic toggle=""yes"">UBQLN2</italic> (NM_013444) encodes the ubiquilin 2 protein, the best studied of five human ubiquilins, which contains a unique PXX domain comprising 12 proline-rich tandem repeats.<sup><xref rid=""awae140-B1"" ref-type=""bibr"">1</xref>,<xref rid=""awae140-B2"" ref-type=""bibr"">2</xref></sup> Like other ALS- and frontotemporal dementia (FTD)-linked degradation proteins [sequestosome 1/p62 (hereafter p62), valosin-containing protein, optineurin, and TANK-binding kinase 1], a key role for ubiquilin 2 is to bind ubiquitinated, misfolded and aggregated protein cargos, triaging them between the proteasome and autophagy intracellular degradation pathways.<sup><xref rid=""awae140-B3"" ref-type=""bibr"">3-6</xref></sup> New evidence suggests that ubiquilin 2 is intrinsically prone to self-assembly and undergoes reversible liquid-liquid phase separation, allowing it to bind ubiquitin-labelled proteins within phase-separated stress granules. It is postulated that upon ubiquitinated protein binding, ubiquilin 2 comes out of the liquid-droplet phase, bringing its cargo from the stress granule for delivery to the proteasome; ubiquilin 2 is therefore also implicated in stress granule disassembly.<sup><xref rid=""awae140-B7"" ref-type=""bibr"">7-10</xref></sup> These roles at the interface between RNA processing and protein degradation—two key pathways in ALS and FTD pathogenesis—may underpin why ubiquilin 2 pathogenic variants cause disease. The majority of ALS and/or FTD (ALS/FTD)-causing <italic toggle=""yes"">UBQLN2</italic> missense variants are found within or flanking the PXX domain.<sup><xref rid=""awae140-B1"" ref-type=""bibr"">1</xref>,<xref rid=""awae140-B11"" ref-type=""bibr"">11-13</xref></sup> Altered residues within this region impair ubiquilin 2 binding to the proteasome and promote self-oligomerization and liquid-to-solid rather than liquid-liquid phase transition.<sup><xref rid=""awae140-B9"" ref-type=""bibr"">9</xref>,<xref rid=""awae140-B14"" ref-type=""bibr"">14-17</xref></sup> Numerous other variants have been identified in the ubiquitin-like domain, the stress-induced protein 1-like domains, or outside of known domains<sup><xref rid=""awae140-B18"" ref-type=""bibr"">18-37</xref></sup>; however, it is currently uncertain which of these <italic toggle=""yes"">UBQLN2</italic> variants are pathogenic. The neuropathology of ALS/FTD caused by <italic toggle=""yes"">UBQLN2</italic> pathogenic variants is characterized by aggregated ubiquilin 2 in subregions of the neocortex, basal ganglia, medulla, spinal cord and hippocampal formation.<sup><xref rid=""awae140-B1"" ref-type=""bibr"">1</xref>,<xref rid=""awae140-B11"" ref-type=""bibr"">11</xref>,<xref rid=""awae140-B12"" ref-type=""bibr"">12</xref>,<xref rid=""awae140-B37"" ref-type=""bibr"">37-39</xref></sup> We previously found abundant ubiquilin 2-positive aggregates in the hippocampus of individuals with p.T487I <italic toggle=""yes"">UBQLN2</italic>-linked ALS+FTD, but not in cases of sporadic ALS.<sup><xref rid=""awae140-B38"" ref-type=""bibr"">38</xref>,<xref rid=""awae140-B39"" ref-type=""bibr"">39</xref></sup> However, ubiquilin 2 inclusions are not specific to <italic toggle=""yes"">UBQLN2</italic>-linked ALS/FTD cases and have been identified previously in sporadic and familial ALS, and ALS-dementia, regardless of whether ubiquilin 2 is wild-type or mutant.<sup><xref rid=""awae140-B1"" ref-type=""bibr"">1</xref>,<xref rid=""awae140-B11"" ref-type=""bibr"">11</xref>,<xref rid=""awae140-B12"" ref-type=""bibr"">12</xref>,<xref rid=""awae140-B37"" ref-type=""bibr"">37</xref>,<xref rid=""awae140-B38"" ref-type=""bibr"">38</xref>,<xref rid=""awae140-B40"" ref-type=""bibr"">40</xref></sup> Some of these ubiquilin 2 inclusions are immunopositive for other ALS/FTD-linked proteins, such as TAR DNA-binding protein-43 (TDP-43) or phosphorylated TDP-43 (pTDP-43), FUS, p62, optineurin or ubiquitin.<sup><xref rid=""awae140-B1"" ref-type=""bibr"">1</xref>,<xref rid=""awae140-B12"" ref-type=""bibr"">12</xref>,<xref rid=""awae140-B41"" ref-type=""bibr"">41-45</xref></sup> In addition, deposition of ubiquilin 2 in the hippocampus is a characteristic feature of ALS/FTD caused by <italic toggle=""yes"">C9orf72</italic> hexanucleotide repeat expansions, in which ubiquilin 2 is seen together with dipeptide repeat (DPR) proteins.<sup><xref rid=""awae140-B40"" ref-type=""bibr"">40</xref></sup> Thus, while ubiquilin 2 is clearly involved in ALS/FTD pathogenesis regardless of aetiology, the role of <italic toggle=""yes"">UBQLN2</italic> pathogenic variants and the predictive value of ubiquilin 2 labelling in relation to genotype is still unclear. There is a clear need to determine whether <italic toggle=""yes"">UBQLN2</italic> pathogenic variants cause ubiquilin 2 neuropathology that is distinct from the wild-type ubiquilin 2 neuropathology seen in ALS/FTD with other genotypes. If they do, then defining a pathological signature for <italic toggle=""yes"">UBQLN2</italic>-linked disease will provide mechanistic insights and aid in assessment of the pathogenicity of <italic toggle=""yes"">UBQLN2</italic> genetic variants, which have not yet been confirmed to be causative. Because ubiquilin 2 aggregation across a range of ALS/FTD genotypes occurs in the hippocampus, this region may provide insight into the requirements for mutant and wild-type ubiquilin 2 aggregation. Here we map the hippocampal ubiquilin 2 protein deposition signature with respect to pTDP-43, the two most abundant <italic toggle=""yes"">C9orf72-</italic>linked DPR proteins, and p62, in ALS/FTD with and without <italic toggle=""yes"">UBQLN2</italic> pathogenic variants.

However, we report here a unique neuropathological signature for mutant ubiquilin 2 in the hippocampus that discriminates <italic toggle=""yes"">UBQLN2</italic>-linked ALS/FTD cases from all others tested. Ubiquilin 2 aggregates were seen in the hippocampus of ALS/FTD cases across a range of genotypes.

This hippocampal ubiquilin 2 neuropathology signature provides the foundations of a framework for exploring the biological implications of <italic toggle=""yes"">UBQLN2</italic> genetic variation and demonstrates that ubiquilin 2 aggregation is likely to play a mechanistic role in <italic toggle=""yes"">C9orf72</italic>-linked and <italic toggle=""yes"">UBQLN2</italic>-linked ALS/FTD.

Variants in several genes have been implicated in both ALS and FTD. Of these, an intronic hexanucleotide repeat expansion (HRE) in <italic toggle=""yes"">C9orf72</italic> is the commonest cause of ALS and FTD, inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR5"">5</xref>]. <italic toggle=""yes"">C9orf72</italic> HRE can manifest as ALS, FTD or both in the same family [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR6"">6</xref>]. Rare variants in several other genes have been implicated in causing both ALS and FTD [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR7"">7</xref>]. An increasing number of relatives of people affected by monogenetic forms of ALS and FTD are aware of their potentially higher risk of developing ALS or FTD through asymptomatic gene variant carrier status although penetrance is variable and poorly understood. Therefore, the search for modifiable factors influencing the risk of ALS and FTD has become more relevant, with an urgent imperative to provide evidence-based guidance. Several lifestyle and metabolic factors have been implicated in influencing ALS risk, including body mass index, strenuous exercise and smoking [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR8"">8</xref>, <xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR9"">9</xref>]. Large population-based cohort studies indicate that higher levels of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-c) and its primary apolipoprotein, apolipoprotein B (ApoB) [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR10"">10</xref>] and lower levels of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-c) and its primary apolipoprotein, apolipoprotein A1 (ApoA1) [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR11"">11</xref>] are associated with ALS. Genetic epidemiological techniques which can circumvent the confounding that limits the causal interpretation of observational studies [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR12"">12</xref>], specifically Mendelian randomisation (MR), suggest that high LDL-c and ApoB directly increase the risk of ALS [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR13"">13</xref>]. Observational studies exploring the effect of lipid biomarkers on survival in people with ALS have been somewhat inconsistent, variably indicating potential relationships between lower HDL-c [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR14"">14</xref>], higher total cholesterol (TC), triglyceride (TG), and LDL-c, and improved survival [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR15"">15</xref>–<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR17"">17</xref>]. A meta-analysis of observational studies did not support a relationship between biomarkers of lipid metabolism and survival in ALS [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR18"">18</xref>], but a large cohort study demonstrated that increased HDL-c is associated with worse survival [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR18"">18</xref>]. The evidence regarding the impact of lipid-lowering medication use on ALS risk is conflicted, with some studies indicating an increased risk of ALS following statin initiation and others indicating no association [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR19"">19</xref>, <xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR20"">20</xref>]. MR methods studying the effect of lipid-lowering drugs on ALS risk, using genetic proxies for the targets of lipid-lowering drugs, suggest a protective effect of HMG-CoA reductase and APOB inhibition. Similar research relating lipid biomarkers and lipid-lowering therapies to the risk of FTD, using either classical epidemiological approaches or genetic epidemiological techniques, is limited. This study aimed to summarise the current literature surrounding the impact of lipids on ALS and FTD risk using a meta-analysis of observational studies and to study the effect of lipid biomarkers on the risk of ALS and FTD and survival in ALS using MR analysis. Additionally, the potential effect of lipid-lowering drugs on ALS and FTD risk and ALS survival was explored using a genetic proxy approach.   Meta-analysis of three cohort studies indicated that elevations in LDL-c and HDL-c are associated with increased and decreased risk of ALS, respectively. No observational studies examining lipid traits and FTD risk were found. In support of a causal role for the observed association between LDL-c and ALS risk, two-sample MR analysis provided evidence of a potential causal association between genetically predicted higher levels of LDL-c, TC and ApoB and risk of ALS, and of higher ApoB levels and FTD risk. However, no association was identified for HDL-c or ApoA1 in relation to ALS or FTD. Using genetic proxies for lipid-lowering therapies targeting four individual genes, this study suggests that reducing LDL-c levels through targeting of <italic toggle=""yes"">APOB</italic> (a genetic proxy for Mipomersen treatment) could reduce the risk of ALS and FTD. All findings were robust to extensive sensitivity analyses. In relation to the effects of lipid biomarkers on the aggressiveness of ALS, no evidence of a causal association between lipid biomarkers or cholesterol-targeting therapies and survival in ALS was found. The extant literature examining the role of lipids and apolipoproteins influencing the development of ALS and FTD is limited. One finding of our meta-analysis, that elevated levels of LDL-c are associated with increased risk of ALS, is supported by causal evidence from our MR study. Previous MR studies have reported similar results, highlighting the negative effect of LDL-c [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR13"">13</xref>, <xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR50"">50</xref>]. We did not find a statistically significant association between ApoB and ALS in the meta-analysis of two cohort studies, which contrasts with our MR analysis and previous genetic epidemiological studies [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR50"">50</xref>]. This might be explained by the high heterogeneity in the meta-analysis (86%), the relationship between ApoB and LDL-c—since ApoB is the major apolipoprotein constituent of a range of circulating lipid particles beyond LDL-c—or potential alterations in lipid biomarkers that occur before the onset of symptomatic ALS, influencing the associations in observational studies [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR51"">51</xref>]. The second finding of our meta-analysis, that lower levels of HDL-c are associated with a higher risk of ALS, was not supported by causal evidence from MR. One case–control study [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR49"">49</xref>] also identified an inverse association, where higher HDL-c increased the risk of ALS, which could be explained by reverse causation, as case–control studies are more susceptible to this, along with variations in population characteristics, measurement methods, and confounding factors that may contribute to the conflicting findings. This is in keeping with prior genetic epidemiological studies, which have also failed to show evidence of a causal role for HDL-c in ALS risk [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR13"">13</xref>]. This parallels findings in cardiovascular disease prevention, in which the robust association between lower HDL-c and higher risk of cardiovascular disease using classical epidemiological methods has not been supported by genetic epidemiological analysis or randomised control trials of treatments aiming to increase HDL-c levels [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR52"">52</xref>, <xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR53"">53</xref>]. There is some evidence for very high levels of HDL-c increasing the risk of cardiovascular disease [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR54"">54</xref>], but it is not clear that this explains the discrepancy between established observational and genetic epidemiological findings, the cause of which remains enigmatic. It may, therefore, indicate that HDL-c levels have a role in the prediction of ALS risk but do not themselves mediate that association. Though no observational studies were identified that examine FTD risk in relation to lipid biomarkers, our MR analysis provides evidence that elevated levels of ApoB increase the risk of FTD. Despite the high correlation between ApoB and LDL-c levels, no causal association was identified between LDL-c and FTD risk. Although all MR analyses of FTD risk were of lower power than analyses of ALS due to the much smaller sample size and SNP coverage in the FTD GWAS, the near-zero association of LDL-c and FTD risk and higher estimated power to detect an effect for LDL-c suggest that insufficient power does not explain this discrepancy. Multiple observational studies have tied metabolic factors during the course of symptomatic ALS with differences in disease progression and survival, including an association between lower levels of HDL-c and shorter survival, higher levels of TG, TC and LDL-c and longer survival [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR14"">14</xref>–<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR18"">18</xref>]. Our MR analysis did not find evidence of a causal relationship between any of the lipid species investigated and survival in ALS. This might be attributable to the lower power to detect a small effect as a consequence of the small sample size of the outcome GWAS of survival in people with ALS, as well as that ALS survival may not be very heritable and that the genetic determinants of lipid metabolism in health may differ from those in disease. However, our findings are in accordance with previous genetic epidemiological work in which polygenic scores for lipid levels were not associated with survival in ALS patients [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR18"">18</xref>]. Observational associations between lipids and survival might be explicable due to systemic metabolic alterations occurring in more aggressive diseases or relate to dietary changes occurring because of the disease process, as opposed to directly influencing survival. Studies of the effect of lipids on the risk of FTD are limited. One previous genetic epidemiological study exploring this relationship did not find an association between lipids and risk of FTD (specifically FTD with TDP-43 pathology), perhaps owing to the smaller sample size and lower genomic coverage of the outcome GWAS [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR55"">55</xref>]. Using genetic proxies for drug targets, we identified a potential effect of targeting APOB as a means to reduce the LDL-c levels and the risk of ALS and FTD. APOB is the major protein constituent of LDL-c, and levels of the two are highly correlated, but it is also the main protein constituent of other lipoprotein particles, including very low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and chylomicrons. APOB acts as a ligand for the activation of the LDL receptor [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR56"">56</xref>]. The discrepancy between causal effects for LDL-c and ApoB levels on FTD risk is, therefore, somewhat unexpected, particularly given that estimates of statistical power (Figure S4) indicate higher power to detect a given effect for LDL-c compared with ApoB. A potential explanation for this discrepancy is that direct measurement of ApoB represents a more accurate measure of the concentration of lipoprotein particles, independent of the amount of cholesterol or other lipids per particle [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR57"">57</xref>, <xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR58"">58</xref>]; again, this parallels cardiovascular disease in which the LDL particle number and ApoB levels more accurately reflect disease risk [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR58"">58</xref>]. As a major constituent of the central nervous system with crucial roles in its normal functioning, there is great interest in defining the role of lipids in neurodegenerative disease [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR59"">59</xref>]. Beyond ALS and FTD, dysfunctional cholesterol metabolism has been identified in Alzheimer’s, Parkinson’s and Huntington’s disease, implicating lipid pathways as a broad aetiological factor in neurodegenerative disease [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR60"">60</xref>]. Since brain cholesterol is largely synthesised in situ without significant translocation of cholesterol from blood [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR61"">61</xref>], it remains unclear how circulating lipids reflect neurodegenerative disease risk. Hypotheses that might explain this relationship include a role for oxidised cholesterol species [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR62"">62</xref>], a means of transporting cholesterol between the central nervous system and circulation that are toxic to neurons, or cholesteryl esters [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR63"">63</xref>], a means of sequestering excess cholesterol but which exert oxidative stress on neurons. Lipid levels may also reflect far more complex changes evolving at the synaptic level [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR64"">64</xref>]. The small sample size of the GWAS of FTD and of survival in people with ALS are significant limitations. This has inevitably impacted the power of the analysis. ALS is a more pathologically homogeneous disease, with 97% of cases being associated with TDP-43 pathology, and only 50% of FTD cases are associated with TDP-43 pathology. Although exposures such as alterations in blood lipids might have an effect on FTD risk that is not pathology-specific, any pathology-specific effect would negatively impact the power of this analysis. No GWAS of sufficient size examining pathological subtypes of FTD exists to probe this question. Limitations relating to the genetic proxies of therapeutic targets include that genetic variants reflect the effect of lifelong changes in lipid levels on ALS or FTD risk, and the magnitude of the effect may not be comparable with the short-term effects of lipid-lowering drugs. Our study only predicts the on-target effects of specific drug targets, and these models do not estimate potential off-target effects. Horizontal pleiotropy cannot be completely excluded, although various sensitivity analyses were performed to test the assumptions of MR analyses. Our analyses also assume no gene–environment or gene–gene interactions and linear and time-dependent effects of drug targets on ALS or FTD risk. Furthermore, since our findings were limited to GWAS of individuals of European ancestry, these findings are not necessarily valid for other genetic ancestries. In conclusion, these data support a causal role for higher LDL-c and total cholesterol increasing the risk of ALS and higher APOB increasing the risk of both ALS and FTD. The findings reveal the potential for <italic toggle=""yes"">APOB</italic> inhibitors to reduce the risk of sporadic ALS and FTD. Further work in monogenic forms of ALS and FTD is necessary to determine whether reducing blood lipids influences risk in those at high risk. Understanding the mechanisms by which LDL-c and ApoB mediate ALS and FTD risk may help identify additional approaches to the prevention of these diseases.

","Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a neurodegenerative disease characterized by progressive muscle weakness and atrophy due to the deterioration of upper motor neurons (UMNs) and lower motor neurons (LMNs) [<xref rid=""CIT0001"" ref-type=""bibr"">1</xref>]. Tragically, most patients were deceased within 3–5 years due to respiratory failure. The exact mechanisms underlying ALS remain elusive by now. The disease is typically categorized into familial and sporadic forms. Familial ALS (FALS) constitutes 5–10% of cases where multiple occurrences are observed within a family, while the sporadic ALS (SALS) was more prevalent [<xref rid=""CIT0002"" ref-type=""bibr"">2</xref>]. Since the identification of <italic toggle=""yes"">SOD1</italic> variants in FALS patients in 1993 [<xref rid=""CIT0003"" ref-type=""bibr"">3</xref>], the genetic landscape of ALS has expanded to encompass more than 40 associated genes [<xref rid=""CIT0004"" ref-type=""bibr"">4</xref>]. It is estimated that approximately 70% of FALS and 15% of SALS harbour such genetic variants [<xref rid=""CIT0002"" ref-type=""bibr"">2</xref>], with <italic toggle=""yes"">SOD1</italic> variants being particularly prevalent among Asian population, notably in FALS [<xref rid=""CIT0005"" ref-type=""bibr"">5</xref>]. To date, more than 200 variants have been reported in <italic toggle=""yes"">SOD1</italic> (<ext-link http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink href=""http://www.hgmd.cf.ac.uk/"" ext-link-type=""uri"">http://www.hgmd.cf.ac.uk/</ext-link>). Intriguingly, these diverse <italic toggle=""yes"">SOD1</italic> variants give rise to a broad spectrum of clinical manifestations in ALS patients. For instance, the p.D11Y variant is characterized by distal limb onset and a slow course [<xref rid=""CIT0006"" ref-type=""bibr"">6</xref>]. Conversely, patients with homozygous p.D91A show an insidious onset and a slow progression with bladder involvement at the later stage, diverging from heterozygous p.D91A carriers, whose symptoms can greatly vary [<xref rid=""CIT0007"" ref-type=""bibr"">7</xref>]. Individuals harbouring p.A5V variant exhibit an aggressive limb-onset phenotype and survive less than two years [<xref rid=""CIT0008"" ref-type=""bibr"">8</xref>]. Patients with p.G42S present as a severe spinal onset, progressing to bulbar involvement and culminating in a brief survival period, typically around one year [<xref rid=""CIT0009"" ref-type=""bibr"">9</xref>]. In contrast, patients with p.E101G or p.G94C demonstrate prolonged survival [<xref rid=""CIT0007"" ref-type=""bibr"">7</xref>,<xref rid=""CIT0010"" ref-type=""bibr"">10</xref>]. Thus, elucidating the intricate link between <italic toggle=""yes"">SOD1</italic> genotypes and their respective phenotype is pivotal for advancing our comprehension of ALS complex nature. The <italic toggle=""yes"">SOD1</italic> gene encodes superoxide dismutase-1, one of three superoxide dismutase enzymes found in humans. <italic toggle=""yes"">SOD1</italic> is ubiquitously expressed and provides a defence against oxygen toxicity by leveraging its copper-zinc bound, highly stable homodimer structure. However, mutated SOD1 leads to deleterious alterations, manifesting as conformational abnormalities, aggregation, mitochondrial dysfunction and prion-like propagation [<xref rid=""CIT0011"" ref-type=""bibr"">11</xref>]. The prevailing hypothesis in SOD1-associated ALS implicates detrimental gain-of-function mechanisms as central to pathogenesis [<xref rid=""CIT0012"" ref-type=""bibr"">12</xref>]. Geographical disparities exist in the prevalence of <italic toggle=""yes"">SOD1</italic> variants. For example, the p.A5V is the most common in North America [<xref rid=""CIT0013"" ref-type=""bibr"">13</xref>], while p.I114T dominates in the United Kingdom and p.L145F in Italy [<xref rid=""CIT0014"" ref-type=""bibr"">14</xref>, <xref rid=""CIT0015"" ref-type=""bibr"">15</xref>]. In our previous study, we found that <italic toggle=""yes"">SOD1</italic> p.H47R and p.V48A variants were most frequent in Southeastern China [<xref rid=""CIT0016"" ref-type=""bibr"">16</xref>]. Given the close genetic proximity of the p.H47R and p.V48A variant sites, their potential shared ancestral origin remains unexplored. Hence, the aim of this study is to determine whether the subjects carrying the p.H47R or p.V48A variants share a common founding lineage. Complementary to this, functional analyses were performed to ascertain the pathogenicity of the p.V48A variant. Additionally, we summarized the genotype–phenotype correlation of these three variants, deepening our insights into the pathology of ALS.   <italic toggle=""yes"">SOD1</italic> variants are notably prevalent among Asian population and more than 200 variants have been reported by now. However, <italic toggle=""yes"">SOD1</italic>-ALS patients presented with a remarkable diversity in clinical presentation. Our collective research, spanning past and present investigations, has identified 44 probands carrying 25 <italic toggle=""yes"">SOD1</italic> variants, of which p.H47R, p.V48A and p.C112Y variants were the most frequent. In addition, the clinical features of the patients carrying these three variants were described. In our cohort, five probands were identified to carry <italic toggle=""yes"">SOD1</italic> p.H47R variant, who predominantly displayed LMN features and prolonged disease course with intact bulbar function. Five other probands with <italic toggle=""yes"">SOD1</italic> p.V48A variant exhibited limb onset, and 80% of them developed bulbar function impairment in the subsequent disease course. LMN impairment was common in most patients. Additionally, five another probands were detected to carry <italic toggle=""yes"">SOD1</italic> p.C112Y variant. All probands clinically presented with limb onset and prominent LMN signs. Bulbar symptoms were also frequently observed among them. Combined with the literature review results, there were 34, 11 and 18 pedigrees carrying p.H47R, p.V48A and p.C112Y variants, respectively. Remarkably, almost a quarter of the pedigrees were sporadic, which is potentially attributable to incomplete penetrance or lack of clear inadequate family medical history. Patients with p.H47R variant typically exhibited lower limb onset with predominantly LMN features and a prolonged duration, which could be easily misdiagnosed as Charcot-Marie-Tooth at the early stage. Most patients with p.V48A had limb onset. The disease duration in most patients was between 2 and 5 years. Patients with p.C112Y variant showed remarkable phenotypic variation, evidenced by a broad range of onset ages and variable disease progression patterns. As the amino acid His47 acts as a copper ligand, the p.H47R disturbs copper binding and weakens affinity to zinc resulting in destabilized, toxic aggregation [<xref rid=""CIT0041"" ref-type=""bibr"">41</xref>]. In a transgenic mouse model expressing p.H47R mutant SOD1, researchers observed hindlimbs muscle weakness and atrophy, along with SOD1 and ubiquitin-positive aggregates in the anterior horns [<xref rid=""CIT0042"" ref-type=""bibr"">42</xref>]. Moreover, these mice displayed structural alterations in the cristae of spinal cord mitochondria [<xref rid=""CIT0043"" ref-type=""bibr"">43</xref>]. The Val48 residue sits at a β-turn and between two copper ion-binding sites, His47 and His49 [<xref rid=""CIT0044"" ref-type=""bibr"">44</xref>], highlighting its potential influence on SOD1 structure and function. A substitution from valine to alanine results in the introduction of a smaller branch chain which may interrupt the copper ion binding and lead to the accumulation of a cytotoxic SOD1 aggregated species [<xref rid=""CIT0045"" ref-type=""bibr"">45</xref>]. The C112 residue is cysteine and the p.C112Y variant has a heightened the propensity for aggregation [<xref rid=""CIT0039"" ref-type=""bibr"">39</xref>]. Liu et al. found the mitochondrial impairments in fibroblast and iPSC derived from the patient carrying p.C112Y variant [<xref rid=""CIT0033"" ref-type=""bibr"">33</xref>,<xref rid=""CIT0036"" ref-type=""bibr"">36</xref>]. As functional studies had been performed in SOD1<sup>H47R</sup> mice and SOD1<sup>C112Y</sup> fibroblast and iPSC, our focus shifted to elucidating cellular dysfunction caused by the p.V48A variant. We found that this variant induces the aggregation of SOD1 protein in <italic toggle=""yes"">SOD1<sup>V48A</sup></italic> fibroblast compared to control fibroblast. Additionally, the accumulation of mutated SOD1 proteins is consistently implicated in multifaceted mitochondrial dysfunction in ALS, such as axonal transport inhibition, energy deficiency and increased cellular ROS production [<xref rid=""CIT0046"" ref-type=""bibr"">46</xref>,<xref rid=""CIT0047"" ref-type=""bibr"">47</xref>]. Considering the fundamental role of mitochondria in cellular metabolism and energy generation, their dysfunction in ALS may cause motor neuron death through calcium-mediated excitotoxicity, increasing ROS and activation of intrinsic apoptotic pathway [<xref rid=""CIT0048"" ref-type=""bibr"">48</xref>,<xref rid=""CIT0049"" ref-type=""bibr"">49</xref>]. In this study, we measure the intracellular ROS level and MMP to assess mitochondrial impairments. Compared to the control fibroblast, the elevated ROS level and decreased MMP were observed in <italic toggle=""yes"">SOD1<sup>V48A</sup></italic> fibroblasts, which was consistent with this line of evidence. As shown in our previous study, the p.H47R, p.V48A and p.C112Y variants were common variants [<xref rid=""CIT0016"" ref-type=""bibr"">16</xref>]. Of note, the p.H47R and p.C112Y variants are mainly distributed in Asia; the p.V48A variant has been exclusively documented in individuals of Chinese descent. Considering the proximity of these two loci, a common founder has been hypothesized for these two variants. In this study, haplotype analysis of seven families showed two distinct allele configurations. As <italic toggle=""yes"">SOD1</italic> p.A5V variant resides 4 kb upstream from p.H47R and p.V48A variants, recombination at this genomic region is deemed unlikely. We assumed the <italic toggle=""yes"">SOD1</italic>-p.A5V haplotype was comparable with the <italic toggle=""yes"">SOD1</italic>-p.H47R and <italic toggle=""yes"">SOD1</italic>-p.V48A haplotypes. Our analysis revealed a fascinating pattern: the haplotypes in four families matched the typical European <italic toggle=""yes"">SOD1</italic>-p.A5V haplotype, while another family’s haplotype aligned with the American haplotype profile. This finding resonates with the work by Garcia et al. which revealed that the American haplotype is most prevalent in East Asian populations, succeeded by the European haplotype. These observations offer valuable insights into the geographic distribution and potential migratory histories of these genetic lineages [<xref rid=""CIT0049"" ref-type=""bibr"">49</xref>]. However, current data showed <italic toggle=""yes"">SOD1</italic>-p.V48A is largely associated with the European haplotype, while the <italic toggle=""yes"">SOD1</italic>-p.H47R aligns with the American haplotype. This diverges from our hypothesis that these prevalent Chinese variants share a unitary ancestral origin. Therefore, a new hypothesis posits dual (North American and European) ancestries for the p.V48A variant, which needed more SOD1 p.V48A samples to validate. Despite the American association of the p.H47R haplotype, its presence in a scattering of Japanese, European and American patients hints at a more intricate, globally dispersed heritage (<ext-link http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink href=""10.1080/07853890.2024.2407522"" ext-link-type=""doi"">Supplementary Table S3</ext-link>). To delve deeper into the origins of the SOD1 p.H47R variant, a meticulous haplotype analysis among affected ALS patients is imperative. This endeavour would benefit immensely from an internationally coordinated effort, where a consortium collaborates to recruit and meticulously examine ALS families globally. There are some limitations in this study. First, the sample size of <italic toggle=""yes"">SOD1</italic> p.H47R or p.V48A patients was small and the blood sample of family members was not collected completely, which hindered comprehensive haplotype interpretation. Expanding the pool of p.H47R and p.V48A patients is essential to robustly discern any shared ancestral roots for these variants in Asian ALS populations. Another limitation lies in the inability to adequately conduct haplotype assessments for <italic toggle=""yes"">SOD1</italic> p.C112Y patients due to a scarcity of familial samples. This investigation further illuminated the p.V48A variant’s role in mitochondrial dysfunction and cytotoxic aggregation formation. Since <italic toggle=""yes"">SOD1</italic> variants also implicate pathways like endoplasmic reticulum stress and protein homeostasis, additional research is imperative to unravel the complex mechanisms at play in <italic toggle=""yes"">SOD1</italic>-ALS using patient-derived fibroblasts. In conclusion, we reported the Chinese ALS patients with <italic toggle=""yes"">SOD1</italic> p.H47R, p.V48A or p.C112Y variant and summarized the genotype–phenotypes of p.H47R, p.V48A and p.C112Y patients. We further demonstrated mitochondrial disturbances and mutant SOD1 aggregation in SOD1V48A fibroblasts. Our research enhances comprehension of the genotype–phenotype relationship in ALS cases linked to SOD1 variants and disputes the notion of a common founder effect for p.H47R and p.V48A variants.

Herbal medicines for SOD1<sup>G93A</sup> mice of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis: preclinical evidence and possible immunologic mechanism,"Currently, there is no cure or effective treatment for Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS). The mechanisms underlying ALS remain unclear, with immunological factors potentially playing a significant role. Adhering to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA), a systematic review of preclinical studies was conducted, searching seven databases including PubMed, covering literature from the inception of the databases to April 10, 2024. Methodological quality of the included literature was assessed using CAMARADES, while the risk of bias in the included studies was evaluated using SYRCLE’s ROB tool. Review Manager 5.4.1 statistical software was used for meta-analysis of the outcomes. The scoping review followed the Joanna Briggs Institute Methodological Guidelines and reporting of this review followed the PRISMA-extension for Scoping Reviews (PRISMA -ScR) checklist to explore the immunological mechanisms of Herbal Medicine (HM) in treating ALS. This systematic review and meta-analysis involved 18 studies with a total of 443 animals. The studies scored between 4 to 8 for methodological quality and 3 to 7 for risk of bias, both summing up to 10.A remarkable effects of HM in ALS mice, including onset time(Standardized Mean Difference(SMD): 1.75, 95% Confidence Interval(CI) (1.14 ~ 2.36), Z = 5.60, <italic toggle=""yes"">P</italic> < 0.01), survival time(SMD = 1.42, 95% CI (0.79 ~ 2.04), Z = 4.44, P < 0.01), stride length(SMD=1.90, 95% CI (1.21 to 2.59), Z = 5.39, P < 0.01) and duration time (Mean Difference(MD)=6.79, 95% CI [-0.28, 13.87], Z=1.88, P =0.06), showing HM’s certain efficiency in treating ALS mice. The scoping review ultimately included 35 articles for review. HMs may treat ALS through mechanisms such as combating oxidative stress, excitatory amino acid toxicity, and calcium cytotoxicity, understanding and exploring the mechanisms will bring hope to patients. Individual herbs and their formulations within HM address ALS through a variety of immune pathways, including safeguarding the blood-brain barrier, countering neuroinflammation, impeding complement system activation, mitigating natural killer cell toxicity, and regulating T cell-mediated immune pathways. The preclinical evidence supports the utilization of HM as a conventional treatment for ALS mice. Growing evidence indicates that HM may potentially delay neurological degeneration in ALS by activating diverse signaling pathways, especially immune pathways.","Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis(ALS)is characterized by dysfunction of upper motor neurons and lower motor neurons, affecting the medulla, cervical, thoracic, and/or lumbar segments. This results in progressive weakening of voluntary skeletal muscles, leading to symptoms such as limb movement impairment, swallowing difficulty, speech problems (dysarthria), and respiratory dysfunction (<xref rid=""B1"" ref-type=""bibr"">1</xref>). The median survival time of ALS is reported as 20 to 48 months after the onset of symptoms, among which 90% to 95% are sporadic ALS, and 5% to 10% of patients are familial ALS (<xref rid=""B2"" ref-type=""bibr"">2</xref>). As ALS remains incurable, treatment is focused on using disease modifying therapies and maximizing quality of life (<xref rid=""B1"" ref-type=""bibr"">1</xref>). Some countries have approved riluzole and edaravone as medications for slowing the progression of ALS. Riluzole, an anti-glutamate agent, prolongs survival in ALS patients in clinical trials and post-marketing analyses, but whether this occurs in all stages of ALS or only in advanced disease remains controversial (<xref rid=""B3"" ref-type=""bibr"">3</xref>). Some studies have reported that people with ALS who meet certain criteria may benefit from the use of edaravone, which has antioxidant properties (<xref rid=""B4"" ref-type=""bibr"">4</xref>–<xref rid=""B6"" ref-type=""bibr"">6</xref>). However, possibly because the study design lacked general applicability to the wider population of ALS patients, post-marketing analyses have raised questions about the safety and benefits of edaravone. As a result, the use of edaravone is still controversial and does not yet have regulatory approval around the world (<xref rid=""B1"" ref-type=""bibr"">1</xref>). An increasing number of people with ALS resort to HMs because of the modest benefits of current therapies. In China and several other Asian countries, HM is widely used alongside Western Medicine (WM), with both systems cooperating to provide healthcare services for the population. However, the diverse responses to HM continue to be a subject of ongoing debate and challenge (<xref rid=""B7"" ref-type=""bibr"">7</xref>). In recent decades, numerous studies have investigated the effectiveness of HMs in treating ALS. Previous systematic reviews have indicated that short-term adjunctive use of HM may improve ALS Functional Rating Scale (ALSFRS) scores and clinical outcomes, with a favorable safety profile compared to placebo or riluzole alone. However, further research is required to evaluate the long-term efficacy of patient-oriented outcomes (<xref rid=""B8"" ref-type=""bibr"">8</xref>). Additionally, there is very low to low-quality evidence indicating that HMs may produce superior treatment responses for ALS without an increased risk of adverse events (<xref rid=""B9"" ref-type=""bibr"">9</xref>). Nevertheless, with their widespread use, HMs have attracted both praise and criticism. A single-center cohort study found that certain HMs were associated with a poorer prognosis in ALS patients (<xref rid=""B10"" ref-type=""bibr"">10</xref>). ALS is a fatal central nervous system neurodegenerative disease. At present, the etiology and pathogenesis of ALS are still unclear. Evidence from clinical studies suggests that dysregulated immune responses contribute to heterogeneity in the clinical presentation of ALS (<xref rid=""B11"" ref-type=""bibr"">11</xref>). Immune inflammation caused by abnormal immune disorders, such as microglial activation, astrocyte proliferation and T cell infiltration, can be observed at the site of motor neuron degeneration (<xref rid=""B12"" ref-type=""bibr"">12</xref>), and immune cell infiltration can accelerate disease progression (<xref rid=""B13"" ref-type=""bibr"">13</xref>), All these suggest that abnormal immune disorders play an important role in the occurrence and development of ALS, and this treatment direction will be an effective treatment strategy. Exactly, in animal models of ALS and <italic toggle=""yes"">in vitro</italic>, the effects of HMs have been consistently praised. This phenomenon creates confusion among researchers and patients regarding the efficacy of HM in ALS studies, leading to questions about its utility and study design implications (<xref rid=""B10"" ref-type=""bibr"">10</xref>). The efficacy and mechanisms of HMs for experimental ALS have not been systematically evaluated yet. In addition, preclinical systematic review of animal data can provide preclinical evidence for the potential translational value from animal models to human disease. Thus, the present study aims to evaluate the efficacy and immunologic mechanisms of HMs through experimental ALS animal models.    The preclinical evidence supports the utilization of HM as a conventional treatment for ALS mice. Growing evidence indicates that HM may potentially delay neurological degeneration in ALS by activating diverse signaling pathways, especially immune pathways.",N/A,17 9 2024
<sup>18</sup>F-FDG PET/CT as a molecular biomarker in the diagnosis of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis associated with prostate cancer and progressive supranuclear palsy: A case report,,"Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is considered a fatal disease. Over time, the term “amyotrophic lateral sclerosis” has undergone various modifications in its definition, which since 1869 has been considered to be pure motor neuron disease (<xref rid=""B1"" ref-type=""bibr"">1</xref>). However, it is currently known as a progressive multisystem neurodegeneration leading to the death of motor neurons, characterized by significant muscle weakness and a poor prognosis. The clinical manifestations are highly variable, but they generally begin in the extremities with upper and lower motor neuron signs (<xref rid=""B2"" ref-type=""bibr"">2</xref>). The average age of onset is in the range of 57–62 years. Muscle weakness starts mainly in the distal muscles rather than in the proximal muscles. Some patients may develop bulbar onset of the disease with dysarthria and dysphagia, and a smaller percentage may only present with isolated primary lateral sclerosis and progressive muscular atrophy (<xref rid=""B3"" ref-type=""bibr"">3</xref>). The disease is progressive and fatal in most patients. Once symptoms start and a diagnosis is confirmed, approximately 50% of patients with ALS have a survival rate of 3 years or more after diagnosis (<xref rid=""B4"" ref-type=""bibr"">4</xref>), approximately 25% live 5 years or more, and up to 10% live more than 10 years; mortality is due in most cases to respiratory muscle failure. In addition to this, extra-motor manifestations have recently been studied more frequently, the percentage of which is increasing and reaching up to 50% of patients. At the neurological level, ALS has been related to various pathologies, the most frequent being frontotemporal dementia (FTD), present in 10–15% of cases and up to 40% can present with cognitive, behavioral and executive alterations (<xref rid=""B5"" ref-type=""bibr"">5</xref>), cases of primary progressive aphasia and progressive supranuclear palsy have been documented (<xref rid=""B6"" ref-type=""bibr"">6</xref><xref rid=""B7"" ref-type=""bibr"">–</xref><xref rid=""B8"" ref-type=""bibr"">8</xref>). On the other hand, some studies refer to the relationship between ALS neurodegeneration and carcinogenesis. Regarding the pathophysiology of cancer, there is a loss in the regulation of apoptosis, which is why cancer cells lead to resistance to death, generating uncontrollable and disorganized growth, while the neurodegeneration caused by ALS is linked to irreversible cell death. Within neurodegenerative diseases, Parkinson's disease (PD) and Alzheimer's disease (AD) are the most studied in terms of their inverse relationship with carcinogenesis, but little has been studied about ALS, even though it is a rare disease that has generated interest in how it relates to various types of cancer (<xref rid=""B9"" ref-type=""bibr"">9</xref>, <xref rid=""B10"" ref-type=""bibr"">10</xref>). The phenotypic, clinical, molecular, and genetic heterogeneity of ALS makes an early diagnosis difficult. Despite this, the diagnosis is based primarily on the clinical history, neurological examination, imaging studies such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), serological tests, and electrodiagnosis (needle electromyography (EMG)), the latter to confirm the involvement of the lower motor neurons (<xref rid=""B11"" ref-type=""bibr"">11</xref>, <xref rid=""B12"" ref-type=""bibr"">12</xref>). According to the Food and Drug Administration-National Institutes of Health (FDA-NIH) Biomarkers Working Group, a biomarker is a measure of the biochemical, functional, biological, cellular, and molecular processes of the disease state (<xref rid=""B13"" ref-type=""bibr"">13</xref>, <xref rid=""B14"" ref-type=""bibr"">14</xref>). Positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) is not considered part of the diagnostic criteria; however, it is having an increasing impact on molecular diagnosis through its radiopharmaceuticals, with <sup>18</sup>F-FDG being the most widely used to assess brain glycolytic metabolism, which is considered a molecular biomarker for ALS (<xref rid=""B15"" ref-type=""bibr"">15</xref>). In recent years, various studies have demonstrated the diagnostic potential of <sup>18</sup>F-FDG PET in the diagnosis and prognosis of patients with ALS (<xref rid=""B16"" ref-type=""bibr"">16</xref>–<xref rid=""B18"" ref-type=""bibr"">18</xref>). Worldwide, prostate cancer is the second most common cancer and is considered the sixth leading cause of cancer-related death. According to the most recent GLOBOCAN report in 2020, approximately 1,414,259 (7.3%) new cases were registered. Timely diagnosis has increased thanks to the detection of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) (<xref rid=""B19"" ref-type=""bibr"">19</xref>). The use of molecular images in patients with prostate cancer has been fundamental in the diagnosis, follow-up, prognosis and treatment of patients, especially with radiotracers that bind to prostate-specific membrane antigen such as <sup>18</sup>F-PSMA-1007 or <sup>68</sup>Ga-PSMA, which have been recommended by different guidelines as an adequate method to evaluate prostate, lymph node and bone involvement in order to provide the greatest therapeutic benefit, including therapy with <sup>177</sup>Lu-PSMA, which in recent years has shown an increase in the overall survival (<xref rid=""B20"" ref-type=""bibr"">20</xref>, <xref rid=""B21"" ref-type=""bibr"">21</xref>). A 67-year-old unemployed, Catholic, right-handed man with a 7-year history of primary hypothyroidism treated with levothyroxine 75 µg and intermediate-risk prostate adenocarcinoma (Gleason 4 + 3 = 7 and ISUP 3), with a low prostate-specific antigen (PSA) of 0.01 ng/dl, rising to 2 ng/dl, and last reported at 4.5 ng/dl with a doubling time of 3 months, was treated with radical prostatectomy and subsequent hormonal blockade (6-monthly application of leuprorelin). A clinical picture of 8 months of evolution is added with muscle weakness and fasciculations in the lower limbs that led to falls, 1 month after these symptoms he presented changes in the tone of voice and difficulty articulating words.. In addition, the patient initially presented dysphagia with liquids, which has progressed to solids. In the last month, he has experienced increased difficulty in breathing and in fasciculations. He has noticed weight loss, with a decrease in muscle mass very noticeable in his legs. In the neurological assessment, he was described as follows: alert; oriented in person, time, place, and circumstance; not fluent in the language, names, repetition, and understanding; flaccid dysarthria; judgment and abstraction without alliteration; and unaltered semantic and declarative memory. His gait was supported by a walker. In the evaluation of the cranial nerves, ocular movements with a limitation to supraversion, hypometric saccades, increased masseteric reflex, a central uvula, asymmetric elevation of the soft palate, decreased gag reflex, a tongue with hypotrophic edges, and fasciculations at rest were found. The strength in the upper extremities was preserved but the strength in the lower extremities was decreased by 3/5 proximal and 4/5 distal. He had an unaltered tone. Muscle tone without alterations. Hypotrophy in interosseous muscles and pelvic limbs. Biceps, triceps, styroradial, patellar, and bilateral Achilles reflexes were increased (+++/++++). There were fasciculations in all four extremities and in the tongue. Exteroceptive and proprioceptive sensation without alterations. Therefore, they integrated the following diagnoses 1. upper motor neuron syndrome and 2. lower motor neuron syndrome, probable ALS. The neuropsychiatric assessment documented easy crying, sometimes feeling unmotivated, sometimes accompanied by laughter, and a greater deterioration of speech and memory (the patient writes on a cell phone to communicate). In addition to the probable picture of ALS, the probable coexistence of FTD was also considered. It complements the diagnostic approach with EMG, which showed fibrillations and positive sharp waves, fasciculation potentials, increased amplitude and polyphasia. The MRI scan showed only data of generalized atrophy (<xref rid=""F1"" ref-type=""fig"">Figure 1</xref>) and the <sup>18</sup>F-FDG PET/CT scan of the brain (<xref rid=""F2"" ref-type=""fig"">Figure 2</xref>) showed decreased metabolism in the cortex of the primary motor area and bilateral premotor, bilateral anterior cingulate, mild to moderate right temporal neocortex in its polar portion with extension to the entorhinal cortex, both caudates, and the posterior third of the putamen. Due to the antecedent of prostatic adenocarcinoma and suspicion of biochemical recurrence, an 18F-PSMA-1007 PET/CT scan was performed, which showed at least four bone-level uptake sites in the left seventh costal arch and sacrum without morphological translation (<xref rid=""F3"" ref-type=""fig"">Figure 3</xref>). Generally, ALS poses multiple challenges in its diagnosis, treatment, and prognosis, with an unfavorable neurodegenerative impact on the quality of life of patients, mainly affecting the motor system, although non-motor manifestations have been increasingly documented. Destruction of the upper and lower motor neurons in the motor cortex, brainstem nuclei, and spinal cord results in atrophy and progressive muscle weakness for which treatment is still very unsatisfactory, hence the poor prognosis. Recently, questions have been raised about the link between cancer and neurodegeneration, in the case of ALS, which has a genetic cause. There is evidence for the involvement of several oncogenes, for example, SQSTM1 (<xref rid=""B22"" ref-type=""bibr"">22</xref>), UBQLN2 (<xref rid=""B23"" ref-type=""bibr"">23</xref>), FUS (<xref rid=""B24"" ref-type=""bibr"">24</xref>), and GRN (<xref rid=""B25"" ref-type=""bibr"">25</xref>). In a study carried out by Gibson et al., they included 1,081 cases of ALS, of which they observed 114 (10.5%) cases with a diagnosis of independent primary cancer. They determined that lung cancer had the lowest risk (hazard ratio (HR) 0.23, <italic toggle=""yes"">p</italic> = 0.002, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.05–0.63) and salivary gland cancer (HR 5.27, <italic toggle=""yes"">p</italic> = 0.041, 95% CI 1.09–15) and testicular cancer (HR 3.82, <italic toggle=""yes"">p</italic> = 0.042, 95% CI 1.06–9.62) (<xref rid=""B26"" ref-type=""bibr"">26</xref>) had a relatively high risk. In our patient, the diagnosis of prostate cancer and the onset of motor symptoms were practically simultaneous. 18F-PSMA PET/CT showed the focal areas at the bone level with an increased uptake of the radiotracer (maximum standardized uptake value 14.3–20.3) (<xref rid=""F3"" ref-type=""fig"">Figure 3</xref>), which did not have a morphological translation. Unfortunately, further imaging was not performed, so these bone lesions could not be confirmed; however, given the high PSA of 4.5 ng/dl and the nadir of 0.01 ng/dl, with a doubling time of 3 months, it was considered a biochemical recurrence. Therefore, the findings described with 18F-PSMA-1007 PET/CT are highly suggestive of metastatic prostate cancer. Depending on the time of the diagnosis of prostate cancer, there is an inversely proportional relationship with death from ALS with low risk, unlike others such as tongue cancer and melanoma (<xref rid=""B10"" ref-type=""bibr"">10</xref>). However, in a more recent study, the risk of ALS was generally not associated with the individual cancer sites examined, including prostate cancer (<xref rid=""B27"" ref-type=""bibr"">27</xref>). The presence of insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-1) is considered a risk factor for the development and growth of prostate cancer (<xref rid=""B28"" ref-type=""bibr"">28</xref>) due to its signaling through RAS/RAF/MAPK (<xref rid=""B29"" ref-type=""bibr"">29</xref>); however, due to its neurotrophic role, it is essential for normal development and plasticity in the nervous system, which is why it has been the subject of investigation for its possible therapeutic and protective effects on ALS (<xref rid=""B30"" ref-type=""bibr"">30</xref>). Most studies support a potential protective and therapeutic effect in ALS with improved survival (<xref rid=""B31"" ref-type=""bibr"">31</xref>–<xref rid=""B33"" ref-type=""bibr"">33</xref>). Unfortunately, in a clinical trial of 330 patients in which IGF-1 was administered subcutaneously, the effects of IGF-1 on muscle strength and survival were observed, and IGF-1-treated patients did not improve in relation to the controls (<xref rid=""B34"" ref-type=""bibr"">34</xref>). To make the diagnosis of ALS, the predominant clinical findings involving the upper and lower motor neurons must be integrated, causing hyperreflexia, weakness, and muscle atrophy, respectively, with the presence of non-motor symptoms, as is the case with our patient with motor and extra-motor manifestations, such as muscle weakness and language disturbances, in addition to the biochemical data on the recurrence of prostate cancer with bone metastases. For many years, molecular imaging has been the mainstay in the field of oncology; however, it currently stands out widely in the neurological field. In 1987, the first PET/CT study with <sup>18</sup>F-FDG was performed, and the metabolic findings of patients with ALS and the involvement of the upper motor neurons were described, showing decreased metabolism in the primary motor cortex compared to healthy patients (<xref rid=""B35"" ref-type=""bibr"">35</xref>). This finding is not the only one; other metabolic alterations have been described, such as hypometabolism in the supplementary motor cortex and the premotor cortex, and the extension to the parietal and frontal lobes (<xref rid=""B36"" ref-type=""bibr"">36</xref>, <xref rid=""B16"" ref-type=""bibr"">16</xref>). <sup>18</sup>F-FDG PET-CT findings of the patient (<xref rid=""F2"" ref-type=""fig"">Figure 2</xref>) revealed a typical pattern described in ALS (bilaterally hypometabolism in the primary motor cortex and premotor cortex), which we could call the “hypometabolic band sign”. In addition, other findings were found that have not been described in ALS (hypometabolism in the anterior” cingulate and striatum). These findings have been described in progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP), for which we consider the coexistence of these two neurodegenerative entities. Therefore, <sup>18</sup>F-FDG PET/CT has the advantage over other imaging modalities in diagnosing the ALS pattern with other co-morbidities, such as this case of PSP. According to a multicenter study conducted by Van Weehaeghe et al. that included 105 patients diagnosed with ALS, they found that <sup>18</sup>F-FDG PET/CT has a sensitivity of 100%, a specificity of 95%, and an accuracy of 95% for the diagnosis of ALS (<xref rid=""B15"" ref-type=""bibr"">15</xref>). For many years, PET/CT has been considered a molecular biomarker due to the use of its radiotracers, whose objective is to visualize molecular processes <italic toggle=""yes"">in vivo</italic>, therefore, at the neurological level we can evaluate synaptic and molecular behavior. For this reason, various scientific publications have taken on the task of investigating its role in ALS. One of the largest cohorts of 195 patients to date compared healthy controls and patients with ALS, highlighting its high sensitivity of 95.4% and specificity of 82.5% (<xref rid=""B16"" ref-type=""bibr"">16</xref>); therefore, unlike other imaging modalities, <sup>18</sup>F-FDG PET/CT allows the early evaluation of metabolic changes at the brain level and the integration of patterns that suggest the coexistence of other diseases. MR studies have also considered it to be a promising biomarker for ALS, especially diffusion tensor imaging (DTI); however, a meta-analysis (<xref rid=""B37"" ref-type=""bibr"">37</xref>) concludes that it has a low sensitivity of 65% and a specificity of 67%. Here we demonstrated a different case in which ALS and PSP coexisted clinically and metabolically according to the findings of <sup>18</sup>F-FDG PET/CT. A comprehensive assessment was made concurrently with the performance of 18F-PSMA-1007 using the history of prostate adenocarcinoma with bone metastases. Because molecular imaging has shed light on the pathophysiology of ALS, it has the potential to fill a critical gap in the diagnostic and prognostic evaluation of ALS. It is crucial to identify the disease early and reliably, through metabolic patterns that allow us to confirm the disease, assess the coexistence of diseases that are frequently associated with ALS, such as FTD, and at the same time differentiate it from other pathologies with similar clinical characteristics.",N/A,17 4 2023
Structural basis for the rescue of hyperexcitable cells by the amyotrophic lateral sclerosis drug Riluzole,"Neuronal hyperexcitability is a key element of many neurodegenerative disorders including the motor neuron disease Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS), where it occurs associated with elevated late sodium current (I<sub>NaL</sub>). I<sub>NaL</sub> results from incomplete inactivation of voltage-gated sodium channels (VGSCs) after their opening and shapes physiological membrane excitability. However, dysfunctional increases can cause hyperexcitability-associated diseases. Here we reveal the atypical binding mechanism which explains how the neuroprotective ALS-treatment drug riluzole stabilises VGSCs in their inactivated state to cause the suppression of I<sub>NaL</sub> that leads to reversed cellular overexcitability. Riluzole accumulates in the membrane and enters VGSCs through openings to their membrane-accessible fenestrations. Riluzole binds within these fenestrations to stabilise the inactivated channel state, allowing for the selective allosteric inhibition of I<sub>NaL</sub> without the physical block of Na<sup>+</sup> conduction associated with traditional channel pore binding VGSC drugs. We further demonstrate that riluzole can reproduce these effects on a disease variant of the non-neuronal VGSC isoform Nav1.4, where pathologically increased I<sub>NaL</sub> is caused directly by mutation. Overall, we identify a model for VGSC inhibition that produces effects consistent with the inhibitory action of riluzole observed in models of ALS. Our findings will aid future drug design and supports research directed towards riluzole repurposing. The authors here present a high-resolution structure of riluzole bound to a voltage-gated sodium channel. This identifies an intramembranous drug-binding site allowing the potent riluzole-induced enhancement of channel inactivation, normalising the hyperexcitable cellular states found in ALS models. This supports riluzole repurposing and aids future drug design efforts.","Riluzole (2-amino-6-(trifluoromethoxy)benzothiazole) is a well-tolerated front-line therapy for Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS)<sup><xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR1"">1</xref></sup>, a fatal motor neuron degenerative disease where death typically occurs 3-5 years after symptom onset<sup><xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR2"">2</xref>,<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR3"">3</xref></sup>. Riluzole is not a cure for ALS, but it significantly increases life expectancy<sup><xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR4"">4</xref></sup>, with compelling evidence suggesting that it delays the effects of neuronal hyperexcitability-induced glutamate excitotoxicity<sup><xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR5"">5</xref>,<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR6"">6</xref></sup> which initiates a cascade of events leading to motor neuron atrophy, muscle decay and eventual fatality<sup><xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR7"">7</xref></sup>. Riluzole has been shown to interact with many potential protein targets, but most of these interactions produce effects at drug concentrations that greatly exceed what is therapeutically achieved<sup><xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR8"">8</xref></sup>. However, at its clinically relevant concentration of ∼1–2 µM, riluzole interacts with voltage-gated sodium channels (VGSCs), inhibiting cellular excitability by specifically stabilising the non-conducting inactivated channel state<sup><xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR8"">8</xref></sup>. In whole-cell recordings, this is reflected by riluzole causing hyperpolarisation of steady-state inactivation (SSI) and prolonging channel recovery from inactivation (RFI), with apparent dissociation constants for the interaction between riluzole with VGSCs inferred from these effects as low as 0.2-0.3µM<sup><xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR9"">9</xref>,<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR10"">10</xref></sup>. Hyperpolarisation of SSI reduces a non-inactivating late sodium current (I<sub>NaL</sub>), which follows the fast-depolarising transient sodium current (I<sub>NaT</sub>) of an action potential (AP). I<sub>NaL</sub> is abnormally increased in many hyperexcitability-associated diseases<sup><xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR11"">11</xref></sup>, and elevated I<sub>NaL</sub> has been described in both sporadic and familial ALS<sup><xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR12"">12</xref>–<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR14"">14</xref></sup>. In models of ALS, riluzole administration reduces I<sub>NaL</sub> and decreases motor neuron excitability<sup><xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR15"">15</xref>–<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR17"">17</xref></sup>, with <1 µM shown to restore both to the levels found in motor neuron controls<sup><xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR15"">15</xref>,<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR16"">16</xref></sup>. Unlike traditional VGSC drugs, riluzole targets I<sub>NaL</sub> without the concurrent inhibition of I<sub>NaT</sub><sup><xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR18"">18</xref>,<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR19"">19</xref></sup>, avoiding the adverse side effects that can be produced by these pore-binding drugs resulting from the off-target block of VGSC isoforms in healthy tissues<sup><xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR20"">20</xref>,<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR21"">21</xref></sup>. Because the channel pore provides the Na<sup>+</sup> conduction pathway for both I<sub>NaT</sub> and I<sub>NaL</sub><sup><xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR22"">22</xref></sup>, riluzole must selectively inhibit I<sub>NaL</sub> through an atypical allosteric mechanism that involves binding outside the channel pore. VGSCs can be classified as populating three transitional states, i.e., resting (closed), activated (open) and inactivated (closed). In a hyperpolarised membrane VGSCs exist in the resting state which, on sufficient depolarisation, causes them to activate to form the upstroke of an AP, before entering a non-conductive inactivated state from which they remain unable to pass current during periods of recovery. Inactivation occurs over both fast (millisecond) and slow (up to seconds) timescales and controls channel availability, and consequently influences cellular excitability<sup><xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR23"">23</xref>,<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR24"">24</xref></sup>. Incomplete inactivation occurs when a fraction of VGSCs remain open, (or close and quickly re-open), after an AP and impacts cellular function, as the sustained I<sub>NaL</sub> that this produces reduces the current required to elicit an action potential, facilitating excitability. I<sub>NaL</sub> has a fundamental physiological role in regulating the excitability of cells and tissues and is modulated according to function. For example, in motor neurons, changes in I<sub>NaL</sub> are involved in enabling the amplified signals required for movement and postural control<sup><xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR25"">25</xref></sup>, while in cardiac myocytes changes in I<sub>NaL</sub> play a role in controlling cardiac rhythm<sup><xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR26"">26</xref></sup>. Consequently, I<sub>NaL</sub> is highly regulated, either through homeostatic processes<sup><xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR27"">27</xref></sup> or by direct interaction with VGSC co-factors (e.g., β-subunits<sup><xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR28"">28</xref></sup> and calmodulin<sup><xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR29"">29</xref></sup>). Failure of I<sub>NaL</sub> regulation that leads to abnormal elevation of this current causes cellular hyperexcitability which, due to the wide distribution of VGSCs in excitable tissue throughout the body, is associated with the development of a variety of diseases, including epilepsies, arrhythmias, myotonias and neuropathic pains<sup><xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR11"">11</xref></sup>, as well as neurodegenerative diseases such as ALS and Alzheimer’s Disease<sup><xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR30"">30</xref></sup>, making selective targeting of I<sub>NaL</sub> a goal for drug development. Riluzole is a drug that selectively targets I<sub>NaL</sub> and, although it is presently only used in the treatment of ALS, it has also been investigated for potential repurposing in many of the aforementioned diseases<sup><xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR31"">31</xref>–<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR34"">34</xref></sup>. However, a structural understanding of how riluzole interacts with VGSCs to produce this effect has been lacking. In this study, we show that riluzole binds VGSCs at a site wholly contained within their intramembrane fenestrations to produce modulation of channel function without obstructing the Na+ conduction pathway vital for normal channel function and reveal the membrane-mediated mechanism that explains how riluzole attains such high potency for its cellular effects without having a high-affinity binding site. For this work, we utilised NavMs, a prokaryotic VGSC (BacNav) from the bacterium <italic toggle=""yes"">Magnetococcus marinus</italic>, which we have previously demonstrated to be a good model for drug binding to eukaryotic VGSCs (eNavs)<sup><xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR35"">35</xref></sup>, and for which we have successfully determined crystal structures in apo<sup><xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR36"">36</xref>,<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR37"">37</xref></sup> and drug-bound forms<sup><xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR37"">37</xref>,<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR38"">38</xref></sup>. The apo-NavMs structure was initially reported to be in the open state due to its wide pore gate. However, recent work has shown this channel model to be non-conductive and also convincingly proposes that π-helix driven transitions in the channel pore (not present in the NavMs crystal structure) are required for Na<sup>+</sup> conduction, redefining this structure as representing an inactivated channel state<sup><xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR39"">39</xref></sup>. BacNavs are homotetramers of ∼30 kDa monomeric subunits containing 6 transmembrane helices (Fig. <xref rid=""Fig1"" ref-type=""fig"">1a, left</xref>), (designated S1-S6), which, when associated, form channels with the basic structure of four peripheral voltage-sensing domains (VSDs), containing helices S1-S4, each independently connected to a Na<sup>+</sup>conducting pore module (PM) in a domain-swapped arrangement that leads to the PMforming structures from one subunit packing against the VSD of a neighbouring subunit<sup><xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR40"">40</xref></sup>, (Fig. <xref rid=""Fig1"" ref-type=""fig"">1b</xref>). The PM houses the intramembranous Na<sup>+</sup>-conducting channel and the extracellular Na<sup>+</sup> selectivity filter (SF), with the channel being formed by S5 and S6 helices from each subunit, and the SF contained within their interconnecting P-loops, which each contain selectivity filter residues sandwiched between membrane descending (P1) and ascending (P2) helices. Lateral fenestrations in the PM penetrate the channel and form intramembrane tunnels that connect the membrane core to the channel pore. This fundamental architecture is maintained in eNavs which create the channels from a single amino acid chain (∼210 kDa), where four individual domains (D<sub>I</sub>-D<sub>IV</sub>) replace subunits to form pseudo-tetrameric structures (shown for the human Nav1.4 isoform in Fig. <xref rid=""Fig1"" ref-type=""fig"">1a</xref>, right and Fig. <xref rid=""Fig1"" ref-type=""fig"">1c</xref>).<fig id=""Fig1""><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><title>Prokaryotic VGSCs are structurally simpler compared to eukaryotic VGSCs but share basic functional architecture.</title><p><bold>a</bold> Basic topology in the membrane of a single chain of the prokaryotic VGSC NavMs, showing the transmembrane helices (labelled 1-6 for helices S1-S6) which forms one domain of the homotetrameric channel, (top left), next to the single chain of the eukaryotic VGSC Nav1.4 which forms all 4 domains (top right) (<bold>b</bold>) Four individual subunits of NavMs produce the functional homotetrameric channel in a domain-swapped arrangement (a single domain coloured in deeper blue), <bold>c</bold> Nav1.4 folds from the single chain to form the functional pseudo-tetrameric channel.</p></caption><graphic http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink href=""41467_2024_52539_Fig1_HTML"" id=""d33e596""></graphic></fig> This study reveals an atypical binding mechanism for a VGSC-drug interaction that is utilised by riluzole to produce effects consistent with its use at therapeutically relevant concentrations in models of ALS and other hyperexcitability-associated diseases. Riluzole follows the hydrophobic membrane accessible pathway thought to be taken by many other small neutral VGSC drug forms which are believed to pass through the fenestrations of these channels to bind in, and then block, the channel pore<sup><xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR53"">53</xref>,<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR54"">54</xref></sup>. However, unlike these drugs, riluzole does not pass through fenestrations but binds within them, with binding at a location which allows the direct interaction between riluzole and a conserved residue on S6<sub>IV</sub> (F1586 in the D<sub>III</sub>-D<sub>IV</sub> fenestration of hNav1.4 or T207 at the equivalent S6 position of NavMs) critical for the observable action of the drug. This binding event results in riluzole selectively stabilising the inactivated state of the channel without occluding the Na<sup>+</sup> conduction pathway, and manifests in cells as riluzole inhibiting I<sub>NaL</sub> which leads to the reduced excitability of hyperexcitable cells without it affecting I<sub>NaT</sub> which is vital for the normal function of the cell. The pursuit of therapeutics which target a selective channel property without binding in the channel pore is the goal of numerous modern VGSC drug development programmes. Still, as of now, few have even made it as far as clinical trials<sup><xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR21"">21</xref></sup>. However, here we show how riluzole, a well-tolerated FDA-approved drug in clinical use since the 1990s, acts in this way. Binding in the fenestrations of voltage-gated ion channels has already been demonstrated for drugs which produce allosteric effects on potassium (e.g., retigabine<sup><xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR55"">55</xref></sup>) and calcium (e.g., nifedipine<sup><xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR56"">56</xref></sup>) channels, and there is a growing list of other channels, GPCRs and transporters where membrane access pathways lead to allosteric intramembrane binding sites for drugs that modulate their targets<sup><xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR57"">57</xref></sup>. These interactions involve drugs that localise into the membrane while potency is usually calculated from the concentrations of these drugs in the aqueous phase. Therefore, high affinity binding to achieve high potency is not necessarily required due to the high local concentrations of the drug around these intramembrane target binding sites<sup><xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR57"">57</xref>,<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR58"">58</xref></sup>. This could account for riluzole being considered a well-tolerated drug, as the low concentration of the drug outside the membrane combined with the absence of any identified high-affinity extracellular or intracellular riluzole binding targets would limit side effects. Here we show that riluzole is the first example of a clinically employed drug that uses a membrane-access pathway to allosterically modulate a VGSC, in this case, resulting from riluzole binding within the intramembrane fenestrations of VGSCs to produce the potent and selective inhibition of I<sub>NaL</sub> over I<sub>NaT</sub>. That this interaction can lead to the normalisation of the pathologically elevated I<sub>NaL</sub> demonstrated in models of ALS<sup><xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR15"">15</xref>,<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR16"">16</xref></sup> and here, with a hNav1.4 disease variant, suggests that riluzole can preferentially target hyperexcitable disease states over normal ones. This highlights the attractiveness of similarly acting drugs for future drug design and supports the investigation of riluzole repurposing for other diseases where I<sub>NaL</sub> dysfunction is implicated as a cause.
