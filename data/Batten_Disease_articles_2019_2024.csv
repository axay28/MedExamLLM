"Identification
of New Modulators and Inhibitors of
Palmitoyl-Protein Thioesterase 1 for CLN1 Batten Disease and Cancer","<graphic http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink href=""ao3c09607_0008"" id=""ab-tgr1""></graphic> Palmitoyl-protein
thioesterase 1 (PPT1) is an understudied
enzyme
that is gaining attention due to its role in the depalmitoylation
of several proteins involved in neurodegenerative diseases and cancer.
PPT1 is overexpressed in several cancers, specifically cholangiocarcinoma
and esophageal cancers. Inhibitors of PPT1 lead to cell death and
have been shown to enhance the killing of tumor cells alongside known
chemotherapeutics. PPT1 is hence a viable target for anticancer drug
development. Furthermore, mutations in PPT1 cause a lysosomal storage
disorder called infantile neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis (CLN1 disease).
Molecules that can inhibit, stabilize, or modulate the activity of
this target are needed to address these diseases. We used PPT1 enzymatic
assays to identify molecules that were subsequently tested by using
differential scanning fluorimetry and microscale thermophoresis. Selected
compounds were also tested in neuroblastoma cell lines. The resulting
PPT1 screening data was used for building machine learning models
to help select additional compounds for testing. We discovered two
of the most potent PPT1 inhibitors reported to date, orlistat (IC<sub>50</sub> 178.8 nM) and palmostatin B (IC<sub>50</sub> 11.8 nM). When
tested in HepG2 cells, it was found that these molecules had decreased
activity, indicating that they were likely not penetrating the cells.
The combination of in vitro enzymatic and biophysical assays enabled
the identification of several molecules that can bind or inhibit PPT1
and may aid in the discovery of modulators or chaperones. The molecules
identified could be used as a starting point for further optimization
as treatments for other potential therapeutic applications outside
CLN1 disease, such as cancer and neurological diseases.","Lysosomal storage diseases (LSDs) are
a collection of more than
70 clinical syndromes caused by mutations in approximately 50 genes
encoding proteins necessary for lysosomal function, and in most cases,
they represent enzymes involved in the cellular degradation and trafficking
of lipids and other macromolecules.<sup><xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""ref1"">1</xref></sup> This
deficiency of a lysosomal function then leads to the accumulation
of a wide range of complex substrates<sup><xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""ref2"">2</xref></sup> and
the secondary impairment of lysosome-related pathways.<sup><xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""ref1"">1</xref></sup> Approximately 70% of LSD is present as a progressive neurodegenerative
disease, highlighting how vulnerable the central nervous system (CNS)
is to lysosomal dysfunction.<sup><xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""ref3"">3</xref></sup> The infantile
neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis (CLN1 disease) is an LSD caused by
mutations in CLN1, which encodes for palmitoyl-protein thioesterase
1 (PPT1).<sup><xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""ref4"">4</xref></sup> CLN1 disease is characterized
by progressive neurodegeneration, blindness, and seizures and is ultimately
fatal in childhood. Age of onset can vary greatly depending on the
type of CLN1 mutation; where patients homozygous for null mutations
display more severe disease symptoms in infancy. Animal models missing
or deficient in PPT1 display neuronal loss, astrocytosis, microglial
activation, motor deficits, and early death.<sup><xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""ref5"">5</xref>,<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""ref6"">6</xref></sup> There
is also accumulating evidence that the lack of PPT1 impacts glial
activation, presynaptic vesicle dysfunction, and postsynaptic deficits
in NMDA receptor maturation.<sup><xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""ref7"">7</xref>,<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""ref8"">8</xref></sup> Missense mutations that
result in complete but misfolded proteins, however, open the possibility
of rescuing enzymatic activity using pharmacological chaperones. These
are ideally small molecules that reversibly bind to a protein and
stabilize its structure, forming a correctly folded protein long enough
to be trafficked out of the ER without being flagged for degradation.<sup><xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""ref9"">9</xref>,<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""ref10"">10</xref></sup> Pharmacological chaperone therapy (PCT) uses these small molecule
active site-specific inhibitors to stabilize the conformation of the
mutant protein in order to increase the level of the residual activity
to a point sufficient to reverse the clinical phenotype.<sup><xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""ref10"">10</xref></sup> This observation is a foundation for drug development
for all enzymes including those involved in LSD.<sup><xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""ref11"">11</xref>−<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""ref13"">13</xref></sup> Restoration
of 3–5% of the enzyme activity has been shown to slow down
the clinical progress of the disease for several LSDs.<sup><xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""ref14"">14</xref>,<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""ref15"">15</xref></sup> Following preclinical in vitro and in vivo studies, chaperone therapies
can be translated to clinical trials (<ext-link ext-link-type=""uri"" http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink href=""https://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acsomega.3c09607/suppl_file/ao3c09607_si_001.pdf"">Table S1</ext-link>), either as monotherapy or in combination with an enzyme replacement
therapy for some of the most prevalent LSDs.<sup><xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""ref3"">3</xref>,<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""ref14"">14</xref>,<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""ref16"">16</xref></sup> Peptide mimics of PPT1 substrates
have been used to stabilize a
mutant PPT1 that carried a T75P missense mutation that displays low
levels of enzyme activity in lymphoblastoid cell lines, increasing
the enzymatic activity twofold.<sup><xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""ref17"">17</xref></sup> PPT1
is a soluble lysosomal depalmitoylation enzyme, which removes long-chain
fatty acids from modified cysteine residues in proteins.<sup><xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""ref18"">18</xref></sup> The homeostasis of protein palmitoylation and
depalmitoylation is therefore essential in the CNS for normal physiological
function.<sup><xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""ref19"">19</xref>,<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""ref20"">20</xref></sup> PPT1 might have additional physiological
functions outside of lysosomes as proteomics analyses have repeatedly
demonstrated the presence of PPT1 in synaptosomes.<sup><xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""ref21"">21</xref>−<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""ref23"">23</xref></sup> Depalmitoylation
by PPT1 is involved in several cellular processes, including those
related to the autophagy–lysosome pathway, but it is especially
important in neurons, where PPT1 contributes to axonal outgrowth,
neurite extension, and dendritic spine morphogenic pathways.<sup><xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""ref20"">20</xref>,<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""ref24"">24</xref>−<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""ref26"">26</xref></sup> A few protein substrates of PPT1 have additionally
been identified, such as glial fibrillary acidic protein, and hyperpalmitoylation
of this exacerbates astrogliosis and neurodegenerative pathology in
PPT1-deficient mice.<sup><xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""ref27"">27</xref></sup> In addition, PPT1
depalmitoylates the F1 complex of the mitochondrial ATP synthase and
is required for proper localization.<sup><xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""ref20"">20</xref>,<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""ref28"">28</xref></sup> PPT1 depalmitoylates
the V-ATPase component, V0a1,<sup><xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""ref29"">29</xref></sup> and inhibitors
of PPT1 can suppress autophagy.<sup><xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""ref30"">30</xref></sup> The Src
family kinase Fyn is a substrate of PPT1,<sup><xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""ref20"">20</xref>,<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""ref31"">31</xref></sup> while Fyn is one of the many kinases known to phosphorylate tau,<sup><xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""ref32"">32</xref></sup> suggesting that PPT1 inhibition and Fyn activity/localization
should be investigated further for therapeutic applications in diseases
such as Alzheimer’s disease. It has been suggested that depalmitoylation
by PPT1 is involved in the developmental switch of regulatory subunits
of the <italic toggle=""yes"">N</italic>-methyl-<sc>d</sc>-aspartate receptor (NMDAR)
from GluN2B to GluN2A and that this switch is disrupted in CLN1 disease.<sup><xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""ref20"">20</xref></sup> Importantly, dynamic palmitoylation of GABA-synthesizing
enzyme glutamic acid decarboxylase 65 (GAD65) regulates its trafficking
and delivery to synapses.<sup><xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""ref33"">33</xref></sup> SNAP25 and
VAMP2 are also suggested to be substrates of PPT1 at the presynapse.<sup><xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""ref34"">34</xref></sup> Despite the primary role of PPT1 in CLN1 disease,
and its activity in depalmitoylation of protein substrates involved
in several cellular processes, only a few inhibitors and molecules
that bind PPT1 have been described to date,<sup><xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""ref35"">35</xref></sup> which includes a peptide combined with palmitate, an <italic toggle=""yes"">N</italic>-hydroxyhydantoin carbamate inhibitor ABC44, as well as chloroquine
and its derivatives.<sup><xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""ref17"">17</xref>,<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""ref36"">36</xref>,<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""ref37"">37</xref></sup> Currently there are no small molecule or biologic treatments that
have regulatory approval and are clinically available for CLN1 Batten
disease treatment. PPT1 has been characterized in SH-SY5Y human
neuroblastoma cells
and proteomic analysis performed,<sup><xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""ref38"">38</xref></sup> which
indicated the involvement of PPT1 in neuronal migration and the dopamine
receptor-mediated signaling pathway. These early studies showed that
PPT1 protects against apoptosis mediated by the Ras-Akt-Caspase pathway
in neuroblastoma cells inferring that protein palmitoylation could
regulate apoptosis.<sup><xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""ref39"">39</xref></sup> PPT1 is hence an
important underutilized target for cancer, and inhibitors lead to
cell death and have been shown to kill tumor cells, enhancing the
killing of neurotumor cells alongside known chemotherapeutics.<sup><xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""ref40"">40</xref>,<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""ref41"">41</xref></sup> Tumor expression of PPT1 is associated with shorter overall survival
in a variety of cancers including cholangiocarcinoma, esophageal cancer,
head and neck cancer, renal cell carcinoma, and hepatocellular cancer.<sup><xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""ref37"">37</xref></sup> We have now employed several biochemical,
biophysical, and computational
techniques in an effort to identify new molecules that bind, stabilize,
or inhibit PPT1. We have identified several molecules that have the
potential to be further studied as small molecule modulators for CLN1
disease, cancer, and other neurological diseases.  PPT1 is an understudied drug target for
a rare disease,<sup><xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""ref52"">52</xref></sup> and it has been recently
described as having
an important role in cancer<sup><xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""ref37"">37</xref></sup> and other
neurological diseases,<sup><xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""ref8"">8</xref>,<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""ref53"">53</xref></sup> besides the PPT1 mutations described
to cause CLN1 Batten disease.<sup><xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""ref52"">52</xref></sup> In order
to find novel molecules that bind or inhibit PPT1, we screened the
MicroSource Spectrum Collection, which led to the identification of
40 compounds with activity >60% when screened. We followed up 11
compounds
with dose–response relationships (<xref rid=""fig1"" ref-type=""fig"">Figure <xref rid=""fig1"" ref-type=""fig"">1</xref></xref>A,B) and orlistat (<xref rid=""tbl1"" ref-type=""other"">Table <xref rid=""tbl1"" ref-type=""other"">1</xref></xref> and <xref rid=""fig1"" ref-type=""fig"">Figure <xref rid=""fig1"" ref-type=""fig"">1</xref></xref>D). Most of the compounds showed high IC<sub>50</sub> > 100 μM; however, orlistat showed an IC<sub>50</sub> of
178.8
nM, an improvement on the previously described inhibitor ABC44 (IC<sub>50</sub> 1.2 μM, <xref rid=""tbl1"" ref-type=""other"">Table <xref rid=""tbl1"" ref-type=""other"">1</xref></xref>), which is a PPT1 inhibitor in vitro and in vivo.<sup><xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""ref36"">36</xref></sup> The orlistat IC<sub>50</sub> also has a higher
affinity for PPT1 than for the FASN.<sup><xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""ref45"">45</xref></sup> We
also tested the activity of a closely structurally related compound
palmostatin B, which showed an IC<sub>50</sub> of 11.8 nM (8.7–15.6
nM). To the best of our knowledge, orlistat and palmostatin B are
the most potent PPT1 inhibitors that have been reported to date. We
have also tested these compounds in cells (<xref rid=""fig2"" ref-type=""fig"">Figure <xref rid=""fig2"" ref-type=""fig"">2</xref></xref>A) and demonstrated that they have poor uptake
likely due to their hydrophobic nature (<xref rid=""fig2"" ref-type=""fig"">Figure <xref rid=""fig2"" ref-type=""fig"">2</xref></xref>B). In the past decade, the importance
of protein palmitoylation in
tumorigenesis has become evident. It plays a crucial role in various
critical aspects of cancer, such as cell proliferation and survival,
cell invasion and metastasis, as well as the modulation of antitumor
immune responses.<sup><xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""ref54"">54</xref></sup> We have reported here
that orlistat and palmostatin B are nanomolar inhibitors of PPT1 which
are structurally related usingTanimoto similarity (MACCS fingerprints)
of 0.65, and both molecules contain a hydrophobic tail and a β
lactone ring. Orlistat is approved in several countries including
the US for the treatment of obesity, as it can prevent absorption
of lipids through binding covalently to the active serine residues
of pancreatic lipase.<sup><xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""ref55"">55</xref></sup> A limitation of
this molecule is that it is poorly orally absorbed which may necessitate
structural modification, nanoformulation, or other techniques to improve
cell entry.<sup><xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""ref56"">56</xref></sup> Orlistat has been investigated
for several cancer types, such as prostate, colorectal, and hepatoma
cells as it is known to inhibit FASN, an enzyme linked with tumor
progression.<sup><xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""ref44"">44</xref>,<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""ref57"">57</xref>−<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""ref59"">59</xref></sup> Our discovery
that orlistat can also inhibit PPT1 with nanomolar activity in vitro
shows a potential new mechanism of action since PPT1 is known to be
significantly overexpressed in several cancer types, including breast,
thyroid, and gastric cancers.<sup><xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""ref37"">37</xref></sup> Higher
expression levels of PPT1 in tumors have also been correlated with
shorter overall survival across various cancer types, including head
and neck, esophageal, and renal cell cancers.<sup><xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""ref37"">37</xref></sup> Orlistat has previously been shown to inhibit FASN (IC<sub>50</sub> 1.35 μM);<sup><xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""ref45"">45</xref></sup> however, the IC<sub>50</sub> value to inhibit cancer cell growth through FASN inhibition
range is much higher (from 5 to 40 μM) in T-cell leukemia and
prostate cancer cell lines,<sup><xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""ref44"">44</xref>,<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""ref60"">60</xref></sup> which confirms our
finding that poor cell penetration is likely a reason for poor PPT1
inhibition in cells by orlistat necessitating improved formulation
to increase cellular potency. Palmostatin B is a nonspecific
depalmitoylation inhibitor that
primarily inhibits the acyl-protein thioesterases APT-1 and APT-2,<sup><xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""ref46"">46</xref></sup> which, like PPT1, can catalyze the removal of
S-palmitoylation from protein substrates.<sup><xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""ref54"">54</xref></sup> It was earlier demonstrated that the combination of palmostatin
B with the FLT3 inhibitor gilteritinib significantly suppressed FLT3-ITD-mediated
signaling and leukemia progression.<sup><xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""ref61"">61</xref></sup> We
are not aware of the absorption of palmostatin being studied, but
it is likely also to be poor due to its similarity to orlistat. Both
orlistat and palmostatin B contain a β-lactone warhead which
is known to react and inhibit enzymes from the serine or threonine
hydrolase class.<sup><xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""ref45"">45</xref>,<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""ref62"">62</xref></sup> PPT1 was previously described
to be the target of chloroquine and
derivatives in neuroblastoma.<sup><xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""ref37"">37</xref></sup> High PPT1
expression predicts poor clinical outcome while the PPT1 inhibitor
DC661 enhanced sorafenib sensitivity in hepatocellular carcinoma.<sup><xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""ref63"">63</xref></sup> We therefore determined the enzyme activity
of PPT1 in the presence of several antimalarial drugs (<xref rid=""fig1"" ref-type=""fig"">Figure <xref rid=""fig1"" ref-type=""fig"">1</xref></xref>C and <ext-link ext-link-type=""uri"" http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink href=""https://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acsomega.3c09607/suppl_file/ao3c09607_si_001.pdf"">Table S3</ext-link>). From the compounds tested, we showed that the antimalarial
amodiaquine inhibits PPT1 with an IC<sub>50</sub> of 344 μM
and binds to this enzyme with a <italic toggle=""yes"">K</italic><sub>d</sub> of
76 nM and also increased the Δ<italic toggle=""yes"">T</italic><sub>m</sub> of 3.3 °C (<xref rid=""fig3"" ref-type=""fig"">Figure <xref rid=""fig3"" ref-type=""fig"">3</xref></xref>D). Chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine were shown to inhibit
PPT1 activity in neuroblastoma cancer cell lines,<sup><xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""ref37"">37</xref></sup> with an IC<sub>50</sub> of 47.2 μM for chloroquine
and IC<sub>50</sub> of 109.1 μM for hydroxychloroquine; however,
they did not show significant changes in the Δ<italic toggle=""yes"">T</italic><sub>m</sub> (<xref rid=""fig3"" ref-type=""fig"">Figure <xref rid=""fig3"" ref-type=""fig"">3</xref></xref>D). For comparison, we also evaluated the enzymatic activity in the
presence of the inhibitor DC661, which was previously described to
be more potent against PPT1<sup><xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""ref37"">37</xref></sup> than chloroquine
and hydroxychloroquine, and in our assay, DC661 showed an estimated
IC<sub>50</sub> of 129.6 μM. The IC<sub>50</sub> values using
purified PPT1 measured for chloroquine and DC661 are therefore the
same order of magnitude as previously reported. These compounds are
all lysosomotropic and their inhibition of PPT1 in cancer cell lines
could potentially rely more on their capacity to accumulate in the
lysosomes<sup><xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""ref64"">64</xref>,<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""ref65"">65</xref></sup> than their individual in vitro inhibition
against the purified PPT1. Pharmacological chaperones can be
active site-specific inhibitors
or allosteric molecules that stabilize the conformation of the mutant
protein in order to increase the level of the residual activity to
reverse the clinical phenotype.<sup><xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""ref10"">10</xref></sup> Finding
such small molecule modulators may have an impact on the quality of
life and increase the lifespan of CLN1 patients. Currently, as no
therapy has received regulatory approval and, therefore, none is clinically
available to reverse the neurological decline in CLN1 Batten disease
or potentially restore PPT1 activity, efforts have been focused on
gene therapy and enzyme replacement as with most other LSDs.<sup><xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""ref14"">14</xref>,<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""ref15"">15</xref></sup> To date, the only molecule reported to act as a chaperone for PPT1
is a peptide combined with palmitate that was demonstrated to cause
a twofold increase in PPT1, using cell lines T75P/R151X.<sup><xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""ref17"">17</xref></sup> Here, we reported 10 molecules that can increase
PPT1 stability Δ<italic toggle=""yes"">T</italic><sub>m</sub> > 2 °C
(<xref rid=""fig3"" ref-type=""fig"">Figure <xref rid=""fig3"" ref-type=""fig"">3</xref></xref>) using nanoDSF.
Among them is rifapentine with a Δ<italic toggle=""yes"">T</italic><sub>m</sub> of 3.9 °C, tetracycline with a Δ<italic toggle=""yes"">T</italic><sub>m</sub> of 3.4 °C, and deschloroclozapine with a Δ<italic toggle=""yes"">T</italic><sub>m</sub> of 3.0 °C. These molecules could be tested
in CLN1 patient cell lines in future to verify if they could rescue
enzyme activity. Of these, deschloroclozapine is perhaps the most
interesting because it can also cross the BBB.<sup><xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""ref66"">66</xref></sup> PPT1 represents a new target in cancer, and we have
reported more
potent inhibitors that could be evaluated for other types of cancer
(<xref rid=""fig4"" ref-type=""fig"">Figure <xref rid=""fig4"" ref-type=""fig"">4</xref></xref>). PPT1 expression
approached the upper limits of RNA expression across multiple tumor
types in the Broad Novartis Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia (<uri http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink href=""https://portals.broadinstitute.org/ccle"">https://portals.broadinstitute.org/ccle</uri>). In The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database, PPT1 gene amplification
is present in 4–10% of ovarian, esophageal, bladder, uterine,
and stomach cancers and PPT1 expression was significantly higher in
metastases compared to primary melanoma tumors.<sup><xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""ref37"">37</xref></sup> PPT1 was also associated with shorter overall survival
in a variety of cancers including esophageal cancer, head and neck
cancer, renal cell carcinoma, and hepatocellular cancer.<sup><xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""ref37"">37</xref></sup> There are no large data sets available
in the public domain (ChEMBL
and PubChem) describing compounds that could bind or inhibit PPT1.
We have now performed a large screening which identified a few inhibitors,
and this is problematic for attempts at machine learning because of
the high data set imbalance. Although we could build a classification
model with reasonable fivefold cross-validation statistics (<ext-link ext-link-type=""uri"" http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink href=""https://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acsomega.3c09607/suppl_file/ao3c09607_si_001.pdf"">Figure S4</ext-link>), this model was not successful in
identifying additional PPT1 inhibitors. The use of alternative machine
learning algorithms and thresholds was attempted and also unsuccessful.
It is likely that in order to improve our machine learning model further,
we would need to generate a much larger data set or use other specialized
algorithms that could deal with smaller data sets such as few-shot
learning.<sup><xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""ref67"">67</xref></sup> We have employed several
in vitro screening and biophysical techniques
as well as a machine learning model in an effort to find potential
molecules for PPT1 and this type of approach may aid research not
only for small molecule modulators or chaperones for CLN1 Batten disease
but also for broader therapeutic uses in neurodegeneration and cancer.
Understanding the role of PPT1 depalmitoylase is a fertile area for
basic science and translational research,<sup><xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""ref20"">20</xref>,<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""ref54"">54</xref></sup> and the compounds described here could further help to advance research
in the field. Here, we report the repurposing as well as discovery
and characterization of new compounds that inhibit or stabilize PPT1,
and among them, identification of the most potent PPT1 inhibitors
in vitro, namely, orlistat and palmostatin B. This sheds light on
the mechanism of action of these compounds and opens new doors for
exploring them as potential treatments for cancer and other neurological
diseases by targeting PPT1. We also highlight the limitations of these
compounds as, clearly due to their high hydrophobicity, they have
poor cellular penetration which would require evaluation of other
formulation methods.<sup><xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""ref56"">56</xref></sup> ",N/A,28 02 2024
"Assessing the integrity of auditory sensory memory processing in CLN<italic toggle=""yes"">3</italic> disease (Juvenile Neuronal Ceroid Lipofuscinosis (Batten disease)): an auditory evoked potential study of the duration-evoked mismatch negativity (MMN)",,"CLN3 disease, also known as juvenile neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis (JNCL – Batten disease), is a childhood-onset neurodegenerative disorder resulting from pathogenic variants in <italic toggle=""yes"">CLN3</italic> that lead to the pathological accumulation of ceroid lipofuscin in lysosomes of multiple cell types, with neurons displaying particular vulnerability [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR1"">1</xref>, <xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR2"">2</xref>]. CLN3 disease is one condition in a genetically heterogeneous class of rare neuronal lysosomal storage disorders, collectively known as neuronal ceroid lipofuscinoses (NCLs). While individually rare, collectively the NCLs constitute the leading known cause of childhood neurodegenerative disorders worldwide [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR1"">1</xref>, <xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR3"">3</xref>]. Symptoms typically onset between 4–7 years of age, with progressive neurodegeneration persisting for approximately 20–25 years, leading to premature mortality [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR4"">4</xref>–<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR6"">6</xref>]. The most common initial symptom is a loss of vision that progresses to severe blindness within 2–4 years, which is typically followed by cognitive decline, onset of seizures and Parkinsonism [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR7"">7</xref>–<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR9"">9</xref>, <xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR4"">4</xref>]. Throughout adolescence and early adulthood, there is progressive loss of cognitive functioning, speech and motor skills [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR5"">5</xref>, <xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR6"">6</xref>, <xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR10"">10</xref>]. Because of the combination of progressive vision loss, motor dysfunction, and cognitive decline, it can be challenging to accurately assess the extent of the progressive neurocognitive decline in this population as the disease takes its course, since the administration of conventional cognitive evaluations that require visual presentation of information is not feasible [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR11"">11</xref>]. As such, there is limited knowledge about perceptual and cognitive capabilities across the progressive clinical stages of <italic toggle=""yes"">CLN3</italic> disease. The consequences of these limitations affect both clinical evaluation and examination of efficacy during clinical trials. There is a pressing need to identify specific quantitative measures of brain function (i.e., neuromarkers or endophenotypes) that could be tracked objectively across the natural course of <italic toggle=""yes"">CLN3</italic> disease. Such measures would mitigate subjective outcomes associated with conventional cognitive evaluation, serve as surrogate biomarkers of disease severity and could provide more precise evidence of treatment effects. Event-related potential (ERP) recordings are an increasingly appealing option in both human patients and animal models of rare diseases [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR12"">12</xref>–<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR18"">18</xref>]. This easy-to-apply non-invasive technique provides the opportunity to acquire objective quantitative measures of brain activity, including cortical network dynamics, without the need for overt behavioral responses from participants (e.g. [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR19"">19</xref>–<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR21"">21</xref>]), and its exquisite temporal resolution allows for assessment of information flow across the cortical hierarchy, from sensory to perceptual to cognitive stages of processing [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR22"">22</xref>]. Since the peripheral visual system is affected severely and early in <italic toggle=""yes"">CLN3</italic> disease, primarily due to macular dystrophy [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR23"">23</xref>], here we deployed the ERP technique to measure auditory sensory-perceptual processing as a means to assess the integrity of early cortical processing in <italic toggle=""yes"">CLN3</italic> disease. This is an important point, since the intention here is to specifically test central cortical processing. As such, the presence of variable peripheral deficits means that visual stimulation cannot be reasonably used to assay the integrity of cortical processing. In contrast, the peripheral auditory system appears to be intact in CLN3 disease, and as such, stimulation can be fatefully delivered to assess central processing dynamics. The integrity of early auditory processing, auditory discrimination, and sensory memory can be studied by recording the well-characterized mismatch negativity (MMN) component of the ERP [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR24"">24</xref>, <xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR25"">25</xref>]. MMN is evoked pre-attentively by introducing occasional changes (deviants) in a regularly occurring stream of auditory inputs (standards), typically by manipulating features such as frequency, location, loudness, phonemic boundaries or duration [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR26"">26</xref>–<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR28"">28</xref>]. MMN experimental designs do not require participant engagement or the ability to follow complex tasks, which makes them ideal for assessment of individuals with limited attention or cognitive impairments. The fact that the MMN has been shown to be generated pre-attentively (automatically) is a key factor in its use in clinical conditions where cognition and attentional functioning is compromised, since its generation does not require engagement with the inputs, and individuals can be engaged in other activities (e.g., reading a book, watching a movie, and even in performing a demanding visual task). A substantial literature has shown that MMN generation to simple feature deviants like “duration” are pre-attentively generated and that attention does not detectably modulate the component [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR29"">29</xref>–<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR34"">34</xref>]. Here, we set out to interrogate auditory sensory memory capabilities in individuals with CLN3 disease, specifically for the feature of “duration” processing, an important cue in auditory perception and consequently in task performance [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR35"">35</xref>–<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR37"">37</xref>]. Our primary hypothesis was that the duration-evoked MMN would be reduced in amplitude in CLN3 disease. Based on prior work by our research group using this identical paradigm in multiple other rare disease populations (Rett Syndrome [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR12"">12</xref>]; 22Q11 deletion syndrome [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR38"">38</xref>]; and Cystinosis [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR13"">13</xref>, <xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR39"">39</xref>]) and in neurotypical controls [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR40"">40</xref>], we had clear precedence to define both the electrodes where the duration MMN is seen to be maximal over frontal scalp (F3, FZ and F4) and the appropriate timeframe within which to make measurements of its maximal amplitude (~ 200–240 ms). An additional design feature of our paradigm was the use of three different rates of stimulation (fast: 450 ms, medium: 900 ms, slow: 1800 ms). This manipulation allows for assessment of the sustainability and robustness of the auditory sensory memory trace, as the amplitude of MMN is directly related to the rate at which the regularly occurring stream of stimuli is presented [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR41"">41</xref>, <xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR42"">42</xref>]. That is, when stimuli occur at a rapid rate, the occasional deviants are highly detectable and tend to “pop out” from the background sequence, evoking a robust MMN. As the rate of presentation is slowed, however, the robustness of the sensory memory trace is diminished, the deviant stimulus does not pop out in a highly discriminable manner, and the MMN is reduced or even absent. Thus, by manipulating presentation rate, one can parametrically vary the strength of the sensory memory trace, providing a greater degree of sensitivity for detecting potential auditory cortical dysfunction. Therefore, our secondary hypothesis was that compared to TD controls, duration-evoked MMN amplitude reductions in CLN3 disease would be more pronounced at the slower presentation rates, where greater demand was placed on the sensory memory system. Finally, since recruitment of participants in rare diseases like CLN3 disease necessitates inclusion of individuals across a large age-range in order to ensure an adequately powered study and to study the progressive stages of the disease, age must also be a consideration in subsequent analyses. It is well-known that auditory responses continue to mature with typical development across age [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR43"">43</xref>–<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR45"">45</xref>], we therefore assessed whether the robustness of the MMN would increase with age in these cohorts.  Figure <xref rid=""Fig1"" ref-type=""fig"">1</xref> displays the ERPs elicited by standard and deviant tones for each group as a function of stimulation rate, and the corresponding difference waveforms, over frontal scalp sites (averaged over; F3, Fz, and F4). As expected, TDs show clear canonical MMN responses with a robust negativity in the period from 200 ms—240 ms post stimulus onset across all SOAs. MMNs to the fast (450 ms) and medium (900 ms) SOA conditions are also evident in the waveform comparisons for the CLN3 disease group, but at the slowest rate (1800 ms), there is no clear MMN in evidence. The MMNs in TDs showed the typical topographic distribution, with a prominent fronto-central negative distribution, accompanied by bilateral positivity over the mastoids (Fig. <xref rid=""Fig2"" ref-type=""fig"">2</xref>), consistent with main generators of the duration MMN in auditory cortices along the supra-temporal plane [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR49"">49</xref>]. Despite weaker magnitudes, individuals with CLN3 disease produced somewhat similar topographical distributions, although at the slowest rate (SOA = 1800 ms), the typical fronto-central distribution was not present (Fig. <xref rid=""Fig2"" ref-type=""fig"">2</xref>, Panel C).<fig id=""Fig1""><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>Group-averaged waveforms for typically developing (TD) and CLN3 disease groups over frontal scalp sites (composite average of F3, Fz and F4).

However, a clear MMN was present only for the 450ms and 900ms SOAs in the CLN3 disease group. The time period of interest is depicted by light blue shaded panels representing the defined time where we obtain average MMN amplitudes for every individual and across each SOA</p></caption><graphic http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink href=""11689_2023_9515_Fig1_HTML"" id=""MO3""></graphic></fig><fig id=""Fig2""><label>Fig. 2</label><caption><p>Topographic representation of the differences between deviant and standard tones across SOAs. An MMN with typical spatial distribution with negativity (blue) over fronto-central scalp and positivity (red/yellow) over the mastoids and posterior scalp is clearly seen in all conditions for the TD group.

As detailed above, we applied complimentary Bayesian statistics as an alternative method to test for a true MMN effect [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR56"">56</xref>]. The Bayesian analog of the <italic toggle=""yes"">t</italic>-test allows us to explicitly determine the amount of evidence in favor of the null hypothesis (<italic toggle=""yes"">H</italic><sub><italic toggle=""yes"">0</italic></sub>), for details see <italic toggle=""yes"">Methods</italic> section. The results revealed that in the 450 ms SOA condition we had a Bayes factor of <italic toggle=""yes"">BF</italic><sub><italic toggle=""yes"">10</italic></sub> = 3.71 which represents moderate evidence for the alternative hypothesis (<italic toggle=""yes"">H</italic><sub><italic toggle=""yes"">1</italic></sub>) as defined by Lee and Wagenmaker [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR60"">60</xref>]. In other words, this indicates that there is moderate evidence in support of a significant MMN effect in the 450 ms SOA condition. We interpret this finding as evidence for an approach to conventional levels of significance. Furthermore, additional cluster-based permutation statistics on spatio-temporal distribution, reported below (section: <italic toggle=""yes"">Spatio-temporal Statistical Cluster Analyses</italic>), provide additional evidence in support of a true MMN effect in the 450 ms SOA using Monte Carlo statistics. Next, when further exploring the MMN in the 1800 ms SOA, the results revealed a Bayes factor of <italic toggle=""yes"">BF</italic><sub><italic toggle=""yes"">10</italic></sub> = 1.51, which represents anecdotal evidence for the null hypothesis (<italic toggle=""yes"">H</italic><sub><italic toggle=""yes"">0</italic></sub>). This finding indicates that there may not be a true MMN in the 1800 ms SOA condition as there is only very weak evidence to suggest that there is a significant difference between the DEV and STD trials at this slowest stimulus presentation rate (i.e., anecdotal evidence for alternative hypothesis (<italic toggle=""yes"">H</italic><sub><italic toggle=""yes"">0</italic></sub>)). Additional exploratory cluster-based statistics, reported below, provide further evidence to suggest that there is no significant MMN effect across channels and time in the 1800 ms SOA. In sum, these findings suggest that in the CLN3 cohort, the 900 ms SOA evoked a robust MMN effect as compared to the other stimulus presentation rates. In the fastest SOA (450 ms), the MMN approached conventional levels of significance, but there was no statistical support for an MMN at the slowest (1800 ms) SOA. As a comparison we report the same analyses as above (only the frequentist probability-based statistics) but within the TD group. As done before, the analyses explored more specifically for MMN effects as a function of SOA within the TD population. The model revealed that there was an overall significant relationship between the DEV and STD trials <inline-formula id=""IEq28""><alternatives><tex-math id=""M55"">\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}

Linear mixed effect analysis pointed to an MMN that was intact in the clinical group for medium presentation rates (900 ms SOA), reflecting a generally preserved ability to discriminate auditory duration deviance and to establish auditory sensory memories. However, the MMN was quite clearly compromised at longer (slower) presentation rates (i.e., the 1800 ms SOA) as greater demand was placed on the sensory memory system, in line with our main hypothesis. Results also suggested that at the most rapid stimulation rate (450 ms SOA), the MMN was weaker in the CLN3 cohort, an effect that was not predicted. Finally, we found that age significantly predicted neurophysiological correlates of sensory memory in CLN3 disease – that is, that the MMN showed a progressive reduction in amplitude with increasing age (i.e., disease progression), exactly opposite to what was observed in TD control participants. In what follows, we describe these results in more detail. First, there was a significant positive relationship between TD and CLN3 participants demonstrating that overall neurophysiological responsivity was relatively comparable across groups as a function of condition, although the absolute group MMN means were significantly different between each cohort. In addition, the a priori hypothesis that age would be significantly related to the MMN effect was supported as the overall fit of the model improved when age was added as a covariate. Additionally, there was a main effect for DEV vs STD trials which further demonstrated that there was an overall generalized MMN effect across both participant groups. A key finding was that presentation rate (i.e., the variation in SOA) was a significant predictor of participant group, indicative of an interaction between groups as a function of rate of presentation. When exploring this further using age as a fixed effect, the results showed that there was only a significant difference between the fast and medium SOAs (i.e., 450 ms and 900 ms), but not between the fast and slow SOAs (i.e., 450 ms and 1800 ms) or slow and medium SOAs (i.e., 1800 ms and 900 ms). This suggested that the MMN in CLN3 participants was equally disrupted in the fast and slow presentation rates and the largest gap in auditory sensory memory performance was between the fast and the medium presentation rates. Next, using a within-subjects model to explicitly test for the MMN effect in the CLN3 group, no significant difference between DEV vs STD trials (i.e., MMN effect) was observed at both the fast and slow presentation rates, whereas there was a robust MMN effect at the medium SOA rate. In partial contrast to the LME results, exploratory <italic toggle=""yes"">post-hoc</italic> cluster statistics did show a significant MMN effect at the fast presentation rate in CLN3, whereas both statistical approaches showed no evidence of an MMN at the slowest rate. This difference in absence and presence of MMN effect at the fastest presentation rate (SOA = 450 ms) is most likely due to the inherent methodological differences in these statistical approaches [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR66"">66</xref>]. The computation of cluster-based statistics takes into consideration adjacent temporal and spatial information and uses cluster-based correction methods to account for multiple comparisons, while the LME approach relies on specific time-windows of interest at a fixed region of interest (i.e., pre-specified electrodes). Additionally, the LME model used age as a covariate. Lastly, it is worth noting that while the MMN was not strictly significant at the 450 ms SOA in CLN3, it did approach conventional levels of significance in the LME (<italic toggle=""yes"">p</italic> = 0.053) and Bayesian analysis pointed to moderate evidence for an MMN at this presentation rate. When focusing on the TD cohort, the MMN was clearly present and highly stable across all SOAs, as expected. Prior work has shown that the strength of the MMN is highly dependent on stimulation rate, with reduced MMN responses observed at slower rates [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR41"">41</xref>, <xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR42"">42</xref>, <xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR67"">67</xref>]. Current understanding of this phenomenon is that the strength of the auditory sensory memory depends on a temporal integration window, such that establishment of a robust sensory memory depends on the presentation of a number of standards within this window, against which the deviant will ultimately be compared. Perceptually, this is very obvious in a design such as the one used here. At rapid rates of presentation (e.g., (SOA of 450 ms)), the duration deviant pops out strongly from the rapid stream of standards, whereas when the rate of presentation is slowed (SOA 1800 ms here), this pop-out is diminished. In extremis, the reader can readily imagine that if the standard tones were presented once per minute or at even longer lags, it would become very difficult to determine a duration deviant relative to these sporadic standards, and this would certainly not be achieved automatically (pre-attentively). The fact that duration MMN is absent at the slowest and most demanding presentation rate here in CLN3 disease, may point to the early stages of a breakdown in automatic detection and integration of these stimuli in auditory sensory memory. It is also worth pointing out here that the presence or absence of an MMN during passive tasks is known to correspond closely with behavioral performance when individuals are asked to actively discriminate the deviants in follow-up behavioral studies. Only deviants that can be discriminated above chance levels are found to also evoke MMN responses [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR67"">67</xref>, <xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR68"">68</xref>]. We did not behaviorally assess auditory discrimination abilities of the participants given the associated loss of vision, speech, and motor decline. Many of the participants with CLN3 disease would not have been able to perform the task. Rather, we employed the passive MMN design to assess the evoked neural activity. It will fall to future work to determine what the perceptual and cognitive implications of this breakdown are [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR10"">10</xref>, <xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR11"">11</xref>, <xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR69"">69</xref>]. However, prior work has shown that weakened ability to sustain information in sensory memory can reflect cognitive deterioration in various clinical conditions [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR42"">42</xref>, <xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR45"">45</xref>, <xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR46"">46</xref>]. It will also be of significant interest to further investigate the duration-evoked MMN at even slower presentation rates. This may better reveal the extent of this difference, and it remains to be determined whether this difference is peculiar to the feature of duration or if it will also be evident for other basic auditory features such as pitch, loudness and location. Manipulations of presentation rate are not the only way in which the auditory sensory memory system can be parametrically manipulated. Whereas the presentation rate manipulation used here is presumed to test the temporal integration window of the MMN system, the sensitivity of the system can also be assessed by manipulating the extent to which the deviant stimulus differs from the standards. Here, a deviant of 180ms was used against a standard tone of 100ms, which represents a large and highly discriminable duration change known to evoke large amplitude MMN responses in neurotypical controls [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR40"">40</xref>]. By parametrically manipulating the extent of the duration deviance, prior work has shown that the amplitude of the MMN tracks with the size of the difference, such that at small differences (e.g. 130ms versus 100ms), the MMN is highly diminished or even absent in neurotypical controls [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR40"">40</xref>]. There are parallels between the current findings of diminished MMN responses at slower presentation rates and prior work in other rare neurodevelopmental diseases, specifically Rett Syndrome (RTT) and Cystinosis [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR12"">12</xref>, <xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR13"">13</xref>]. In Rett participants, for example, the duration-evoked MMN was only detected when stimuli were presented at the most rapid presentation rate of 450 ms SOA, and unlike the CLN3 disease participants reported here, no MMN was evident at the 900 ms SOA, nor at the 1800 ms SOA, suggesting a more severe disease course in this population. Likewise, participants diagnosed with Cystinosis, another of the rare lysosomal storage disorders, produced robust MMNs comparable to those seen in TDs only in response to the fastest presentation rate (i.e., at 450 ms SOA) [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR13"">13</xref>], with clear atypicalities in the MMN at the two slower rates 900 ms SOA and 1800 ms SOA). Taken together, these data suggest that the duration-evoked MMN may be a sensitive measure of disease severity across a number of neurodevelopmental disorders. An unanticipated finding here was the weakened MMN response in CLN3 disease at the fastest presentation rate (i.e., the 450 ms SOA). This is the rate at which one expects the most robust MMN to be produced, whereas it was at the medium rate (900 ms SOA) that this occurred in CLN3. Since this was not explicitly predicted, the effect warrants replication in an independent cohort before any strong conclusions can be drawn. Nonetheless, these data suggest that there may be an emerging deficit in the ability to generate auditory sensory memories for duration at rapid presentation rates in CLN3 disease. Clinically, some of the most striking differences observed in individuals with CLN3 disease are in memory, attention and speech functions [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR5"">5</xref>, <xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR6"">6</xref>, <xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR10"">10</xref>, <xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR11"">11</xref>]. This cognitive decline generally begins around the time of onset of vision impairment, but continues to progress over years, even after vision loss is maximal [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR9"">9</xref>, <xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR70"">70</xref>]. To date, quantitative characterization of these differences has not been well-defined [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR11"">11</xref>]. As such, the relationships between cognitive impairments and other clinical features of CLN3 disease are not yet well understood. For instance, the onset of visual decline and of cognitive deterioration have been a subject of debate [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR6"">6</xref>]. It is generally accepted that the onset of observable cognitive decline begins within two years of the onset of visual decline [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR6"">6</xref>, <xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR10"">10</xref>]. This has been shown in some individuals with CLN3 disease, while in others, this decline seemed to precede visual deterioration or even emerge at a much later stage [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR71"">71</xref>–<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR74"">74</xref>]. These inconsistencies in the manifestation of the onset of cognitive decline were taken to highlight the importance of careful acquisition of patient history in those suspected to have CLN3 disease [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR6"">6</xref>]. Similarly, understanding the extent of cognitive regression in CLN3 disease is an important component in identifying reliable neurophysiological biomarkers of this disease. As far as we know, the use of electrophysiological assays to evaluate cognitive abilities including attention and memory has not yet been leveraged in this population. The current work serves as a good first step in exploring and developing objective neural markers of pathology (biomarkers) that can be easily carried out noninvasively throughout the progressive stages of CLN3 disease. Genetically manipulated mouse models of disease are remarkably powerful research tools, providing essential insights into the neurobiological substrates of neurodevelopmental disorders like CLN3 disease [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR75"">75</xref>–<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR77"">77</xref>], and yet many of the outcome measures used to quantify or track disease progression in a mouse cannot be meaningfully applied in humans. Obviously enough, invasive electrophysiological recordings, ubiquitous in model systems work, are not feasible in humans. Similarly, many of the behavioral assays used to assess disease progression and severity in a mouse are only loosely related to human behaviors [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR78"">78</xref>], and higher-order functions such as cognitive control and language cannot be readily interrogated. Establishing objective neurophysiological markers of disease progression in human patients is a crucial step towards bridging this inter-species translational divide. In humans, measures of brain electrophysiology are almost exclusively made using non-invasive scalp recordings that assay the activity of large distributed neuronal ensembles across the entire brain (i.e., circuit-level analysis). In mouse models, typical assays involve single or multi-unit neuronal recordings in vivo (usually in anesthetized preparations) or in vitro slice preparations where synaptic plasticity can be assessed. Again, while the approaches used in each species are certainly powerful in their own right, the researcher is mostly left to infer or speculate about correspondences across species. However, ERP markers like the MMN can be readily recorded in mice using wholly similar, if not identical experimental procedures [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR79"">79</xref>, <xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR80"">80</xref>]. It will be important to determine going forward whether in mouse models of Batten disease, the MMN phenotype seen here can be recapitulated. If so, it will present as an excellent cross-species neuromarker. This study points to a preserved ability of individuals with CLN3 disease to automatically decode duration deviations in the auditory stream when stimuli are presented at medium presentation rates. Despite this, automatic detection of duration changes was atypical in these individuals when the presentation rate of the stimulus stream was slowed to both the lowest value 1800 ms SOA) and the fastest (450 ms SOA) used in the current study, suggesting that when additional demand is put upon the auditory sensory memory, more subtle atypicalities are revealed. We speculate that this attenuation in the duration of sensory memory might lead to significant implications for different aspects of information processing, task performance and language acquisition. The exact mechanisms underlying this decline, as well as behavioral outcomes, represent important avenues of research to increase knowledge of CLN3 disease and its perceptual and cognitive sequelae. Measures such as these could potentially serve as surrogate biomarkers with the ability to index disease severity and treatment response. ",N/A,6 1 2024

This suggests that gut bacteria might contribute to the beneficial effects of acidified drinking water. Our study demonstrates that drinking water is a major environmental factor that can alter disease phenotypes and disease progression in rodent disease models.","Late infantile CLN2 disease is a recessively inherited, progressive neurodegenerative disorder that belongs to neuronal ceroid lipofuscinoses (also known as Batten disease), a group of lysosomal storage diseases with ceroid lipofuscin as storage material. CLN2 disease is caused by mutations in the <italic toggle=""yes"">CLN2</italic> gene encoding the lysosomal protease, tripeptidyl peptidase 1 (TPP1)<sup><xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR1"">1</xref></sup>. The disease begins at 2–4 years of age with seizures and ataxia followed by visual impairment and progressive cognitive and motor dysfunction, leading to death by 6–15 years of age<sup><xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR2"">2</xref></sup>. It is still unknown how TPP1 deficiency results in brain atrophy. Since 2017, enzyme replacement therapy by intracerebroventricular infusion has been available for patients with CLN2 disease. This treatment with a recombinant TPP1 (cerliponase alfa by BioMarin Pharmaceutical Inc.) slows the decline of motor and language functions in symptomatic CLN2 disease patients 3 years of age and older<sup><xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR3"">3</xref>, <xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR4"">4</xref></sup>. We have recently generated a novel mouse model of the disease, <italic toggle=""yes"">Cln2</italic><sup><italic toggle=""yes"">R207X</italic></sup> mice. The <italic toggle=""yes"">Cln2</italic> mutation in these mice corresponds to the most frequent disease-causing human nonsense mutation. In <italic toggle=""yes"">Cln2</italic><sup><italic toggle=""yes"">R207X</italic></sup> mice, due to the nonsense mutation that generates a premature stop codon, the mutant <italic toggle=""yes"">Cln2</italic> mRNA level is markedly decreased by nonsense-mediated mRNA decay. Accordingly, TPP1 enzyme activity is dramatically reduced in the organs of <italic toggle=""yes"">Cln2</italic><sup><italic toggle=""yes"">R207X</italic></sup> mice. Less than 1% of the wild-type TPP1 activity was measured in the liver, kidney, cerebral cortex and cerebellum of <italic toggle=""yes"">Cln2</italic><sup><italic toggle=""yes"">R207X</italic></sup> mice<sup><xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR5"">5</xref></sup>. <italic toggle=""yes"">Cln2</italic><sup><italic toggle=""yes"">R207X</italic></sup> mice have a progressive disease course with significant neurological abnormalities, tremors, and neuropathological changes, such as accumulation of lysosomal storage material and astrocytic activation in the brain at 3 months of age. <italic toggle=""yes"">Cln2</italic><sup><italic toggle=""yes"">R207X</italic></sup> mice prematurely die between 4 and 6 months of age<sup><xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR5"">5</xref></sup>. The type of drinking water (tap, distilled, autoclaved, acidified, neutral, alkaline) is a major environmental factor that can affect the physiology of experimental animals, but it is rarely reported in scientific publications. At numerous animal facilities, acidification of drinking water with HCl is used to eliminate pathogenic bacteria. We have recently shown in the <italic toggle=""yes"">Cln3</italic><sup><italic toggle=""yes"">−/−</italic></sup> and <italic toggle=""yes"">Cln1</italic><sup><italic toggle=""yes"">R151X</italic></sup> mouse models of juvenile CLN3 and infantile CLN1 diseases that acidified drinking water attenuated neuropathological changes in a disease-specific manner and provided disease-dependent beneficial effects on neurological function<sup><xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR6"">6</xref>, <xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR7"">7</xref></sup>. In both <italic toggle=""yes"">Cln3</italic><sup><italic toggle=""yes"">−/−</italic></sup> and <italic toggle=""yes"">Cln1</italic><sup><italic toggle=""yes"">R151X</italic></sup> mice, the effects of acidified drinking water were accompanied by significant changes in the gut microbiota composition<sup><xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR6"">6</xref>, <xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR7"">7</xref></sup>. In the current study, we tested if acidified drinking water provides disease-modifying effects in the <italic toggle=""yes"">Cln2</italic><sup><italic toggle=""yes"">R207X</italic></sup> nonsense mutant mouse model of late infantile CLN2 disease. The effect of acidified drinking water on the altered gut microbiota composition of <italic toggle=""yes"">Cln2</italic><sup><italic toggle=""yes"">R207X</italic></sup> mice was also examined.   Our study demonstrates that acidified drinking water administered to <italic toggle=""yes"">Cln2</italic><sup><italic toggle=""yes"">R207X</italic></sup> mice from postnatal day 21 significantly improves motor function, restores muscle strength to the WT level and prevents tremors as measured at 3 months of age. Acidified drinking water also changed disease trajectory, delaying the death of <italic toggle=""yes"">Cln2</italic><sup><italic toggle=""yes"">R207X</italic></sup> mice by 3 weeks. The gut microbiota of <italic toggle=""yes"">Cln2</italic><sup><italic toggle=""yes"">R207X</italic></sup> and WT mice significantly differed and acidified drinking water caused pronounced changes in the gut microbiota composition of <italic toggle=""yes"">Cln2</italic><sup><italic toggle=""yes"">R207X</italic></sup> mice. The complete prevention of tremors by acidified drinking water in <italic toggle=""yes"">Cln2</italic><sup><italic toggle=""yes"">R207X</italic></sup> mice was surprising. However, we have previously found that acidified drinking water can cause striking changes in serum metabolite levels in WT mice that included amino acids and their metabolites, fatty acids and their metabolites and many glycerophospholipids<sup><xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR15"">15</xref></sup>. Similar acidified water-induced changes in neuroactive metabolite levels in <italic toggle=""yes"">Cln2</italic><sup><italic toggle=""yes"">R207X</italic></sup> mice may be responsible for the prevention of tremor development. For example, the serum level of palmitic amide, a primary fatty acid amide derived from palmitic acid, was increased 43.4-fold by acidified drinking water in WT mice<sup><xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR15"">15</xref></sup>. Fatty acid amides compete with endocannabinoids for binding to the active site of fatty acid amide hydrolase and thus, increase the concentration of endocannabinoids by preventing their degradation<sup><xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR18"">18</xref></sup>. Cannabinoids are known to reduce tremors associated with neurodegenerative diseases<sup><xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR19"">19</xref></sup>. Acidified drinking water in <italic toggle=""yes"">Cln2</italic><sup><italic toggle=""yes"">R207X</italic></sup> mice, in comparison to WT mice, changed several locomotor and behavioral parameters as measured in the force-plate actimeter: the area covered and total degrees of left and right turns were increased, whereas space utilization (spatial statistic) and bout of low mobility were decreased (see Figs. <xref rid=""MOESM1"" ref-type=""media"">S1</xref>, <xref rid=""MOESM1"" ref-type=""media"">S2</xref>). Although, the significance of these parameters is not clear, the changes in them may represent potentially negative effects of acidified water in <italic toggle=""yes"">Cln2</italic><sup><italic toggle=""yes"">R207X</italic></sup> mice. Since <italic toggle=""yes"">Cln2</italic><sup><italic toggle=""yes"">R207X</italic></sup> mice die very early, starting around 4 months of age, our study focused on the effects of acidified drinking water on neurological functions and life span, which are more important outcome measures than the pathological changes in the brain (accumulation of lysosomal storage material, astrocytosis and microglial activation) common in mouse models of the different Batten disease forms. Most <italic toggle=""yes"">Cln2</italic><sup><italic toggle=""yes"">R207X</italic></sup> mice in our colony died suddenly: 1 day they were fine or just had tremors and the next day they were found dead. Examination of the organs of <italic toggle=""yes"">Cln2</italic><sup><italic toggle=""yes"">R207X</italic></sup> mice by a veterinary pathologist could not identify a definitive causes of death<sup><xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR5"">5</xref></sup>. A recent study, however, showed a temporal relationship between seizure activity and death in <italic toggle=""yes"">Cln2</italic><sup><italic toggle=""yes"">R207X</italic></sup> mice<sup><xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR20"">20</xref></sup>. The most likely cause of sudden death associated with neurodegeneration and brain dysfunction is respiratory arrest as observed in epileptic patients<sup><xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR21"">21</xref></sup> and in a mouse model of Leigh syndrome, a progressive encephalomyelopathy<sup><xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR22"">22</xref></sup>. The underlying cause is the suppression/dysfunction of respiratory centers in the brainstem. While acidified drinking water in <italic toggle=""yes"">Cln2</italic><sup><italic toggle=""yes"">R207X</italic></sup> males improved motor function, restored muscle strength to the WT level and prevented tremors, it only delayed the death by 3 weeks: the median survival age was increased from 16 to 19 weeks. In <italic toggle=""yes"">Cln2</italic><sup><italic toggle=""yes"">R207X</italic></sup> females, acidified water increased the median survival age from 15 to 18 weeks (see Fig. <xref rid=""Fig3"" ref-type=""fig"">3</xref>). Despite the similar effects on median survival in <italic toggle=""yes"">Cln2</italic><sup><italic toggle=""yes"">R207X</italic></sup> males and females, acidified drinking water changed the survival curves of males and females differently. While the survival curves of <italic toggle=""yes"">Cln2</italic><sup><italic toggle=""yes"">R207X</italic></sup> males crossed each other at 21 weeks of age, the female survival curves did not cross each other. At 18 weeks of age, all <italic toggle=""yes"">Cln2</italic><sup><italic toggle=""yes"">R207X</italic></sup> females receiving non-acidified water were dead but 47% of <italic toggle=""yes"">Cln2</italic><sup><italic toggle=""yes"">R207X</italic></sup> females receiving acidified water were still alive, indicating a more pronounced effect of acidified water on the survival of <italic toggle=""yes"">Cln2</italic><sup><italic toggle=""yes"">R207X</italic></sup> females. Future studies will determine if the delayed death in <italic toggle=""yes"">Cln2</italic><sup><italic toggle=""yes"">R207X</italic></sup> females is associated with neurological improvements like in <italic toggle=""yes"">Cln2</italic><sup><italic toggle=""yes"">R207X</italic></sup> males. We have previously tested the effects of acidified drinking water on neurological functions in <italic toggle=""yes"">Cln3</italic><sup><italic toggle=""yes"">−/−</italic></sup> and <italic toggle=""yes"">Cln1</italic><sup><italic toggle=""yes"">R151X</italic></sup> mice, models of juvenile CLN3 and infantile CLN1 diseases<sup><xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR6"">6</xref>, <xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR7"">7</xref></sup>. While <italic toggle=""yes"">Cln3</italic><sup><italic toggle=""yes"">−/−</italic></sup> mice were on the 129S6/SvEv genetic background, <italic toggle=""yes"">Cln1</italic><sup><italic toggle=""yes"">R151X</italic></sup> mice were on the same mixed 129S6/SvEv;C57BL/6J background as <italic toggle=""yes"">Cln2</italic><sup><italic toggle=""yes"">R207X</italic></sup> mice. Acidified drinking water in <italic toggle=""yes"">Cln3</italic><sup><italic toggle=""yes"">−/−</italic></sup> mice had a temporary effect, improving the pole climbing ability at 3 months but not at 6 months of age<sup><xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR6"">6</xref></sup>. In <italic toggle=""yes"">Cln1</italic><sup><italic toggle=""yes"">R151X</italic></sup> mice, however, acidified water prevented the motor impairment at both 3 and 6 months as measured in the pole climbing test<sup><xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR7"">7</xref></sup>. Acidified drinking water had a similar effect on the pole climbing ability of <italic toggle=""yes"">Cln2</italic><sup><italic toggle=""yes"">R207X</italic></sup> mice; they could climb down the vertical pole as quickly as WT mice at 3 months of age (see Fig. <xref rid=""Fig1"" ref-type=""fig"">1</xref>). These results indicate that acidified drinking water is more beneficial for <italic toggle=""yes"">Cln1</italic> and <italic toggle=""yes"">Cln2</italic> mutations than for a <italic toggle=""yes"">Cln3</italic> deletion, and/or the genetic background has a strong influence on the disease-modifying effects of acidified water. Accumulated evidence shows that an altered gut microbiota, by its secreted metabolites and via the vagus nerve, contributes to disease development and progression in neurological and neurodegenerative disorders<sup><xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR23"">23</xref></sup>. We have previously demonstrated markedly changed gut microflora in <italic toggle=""yes"">Cln3</italic><sup><italic toggle=""yes"">−/−</italic></sup> and <italic toggle=""yes"">Cln1</italic><sup><italic toggle=""yes"">R151X</italic></sup> mice<sup><xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR6"">6</xref>, <xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR7"">7</xref></sup>, and now confirmed that the gut microbiota is also altered in <italic toggle=""yes"">Cln2</italic><sup><italic toggle=""yes"">R207X</italic></sup> mice (see Fig. <xref rid=""Fig4"" ref-type=""fig"">4</xref>). While acidified drinking water did not change alpha diversity of the gut microbiota in <italic toggle=""yes"">Cln3</italic><sup><italic toggle=""yes"">−/−</italic></sup> and <italic toggle=""yes"">Cln2</italic><sup><italic toggle=""yes"">R207X</italic></sup> mice, it temporarily decreased alpha diversity in <italic toggle=""yes"">Cln1</italic><sup><italic toggle=""yes"">R151X</italic></sup> mice at 3 months of age<sup><xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR7"">7</xref></sup>. Beta diversity, the global gut microbiota composition, was prominently changed by acidified water in both <italic toggle=""yes"">Cln1</italic><sup><italic toggle=""yes"">R151X</italic></sup> and <italic toggle=""yes"">Cln2</italic><sup><italic toggle=""yes"">R207X</italic></sup> mice, but still remained different from that in WT mice. In contrast, acidified drinking water did not alter beta diversity in <italic toggle=""yes"">Cln3</italic><sup><italic toggle=""yes"">−/−</italic></sup> mice<sup><xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR6"">6</xref></sup>. At the individual taxonomic levels, acidified drinking water caused significant changes in <italic toggle=""yes"">Cln3</italic><sup><italic toggle=""yes"">−/−</italic></sup>, <italic toggle=""yes"">Cln1</italic><sup><italic toggle=""yes"">R151X</italic></sup> and <italic toggle=""yes"">Cln2</italic><sup><italic toggle=""yes"">R207X</italic></sup> mice, but the changes were specific to each mouse model. For instance, while the abundance of the short-chain fatty acid-producing bacterial family, <italic toggle=""yes"">Erysipelotrichaceae</italic> was markedly increased by acidified water in the gut of <italic toggle=""yes"">Cln1</italic><sup><italic toggle=""yes"">R151X</italic></sup> mice, it was unchanged in <italic toggle=""yes"">Cln2</italic><sup><italic toggle=""yes"">R207X</italic></sup> mice. Similarly, while acidified water highly elevated the abundance of the <italic toggle=""yes"">Eubacterium coprostanoligenes group</italic> genus (105.6-fold) in <italic toggle=""yes"">Cln2</italic><sup><italic toggle=""yes"">R207X</italic></sup> mice, it did not change the abundance of this genus in <italic toggle=""yes"">Cln1</italic><sup><italic toggle=""yes"">R151X</italic></sup> mice. The acidified drinking water-caused changes in the gut microbiota of <italic toggle=""yes"">Cln2</italic><sup><italic toggle=""yes"">R207X</italic></sup> mice might contribute to the improved neurological function and delayed death, although it cannot be assumed that these events are causally related. Acidified water caused an 8.6-fold increase in the abundance of the <italic toggle=""yes"">Ruminococcaceae UCG-005</italic> genus in <italic toggle=""yes"">Cln2</italic><sup><italic toggle=""yes"">R207X</italic></sup> mice (see Supplementary Table <xref rid=""MOESM2"" ref-type=""media"">1</xref>). Bacteria in the <italic toggle=""yes"">Ruminococcaceae UCG-005</italic> genus produce butyrate and other short-chain fatty acids<sup><xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR24"">24</xref></sup> that prevent neuroinflammation by inhibiting microglial activation and secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines<sup><xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR25"">25</xref></sup>. Short-chain fatty acids from gut bacteria also have beneficial effects on neuronal function by modulating the levels of neurotransmitters and neurotrophic factors<sup><xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR25"">25</xref></sup>, and provide neuroprotection in mouse models of Parkinson’s disease, stroke and encephalopathy<sup><xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR26"">26</xref>–<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR29"">29</xref></sup>. Increased plasma cholesterol levels have been associated with neuroinflammation and impaired brain function<sup><xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR30"">30</xref></sup>. Gut bacteria in the <italic toggle=""yes"">Eubacterium coprostanoligenes group</italic> genus reduce the host’s cholesterol level by converting cholesterol to coprostanol<sup><xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR31"">31</xref></sup>, and acidified drinking water in <italic toggle=""yes"">Cln2</italic><sup><italic toggle=""yes"">R207X</italic></sup> mice increased the abundance of the <italic toggle=""yes"">Eubacterium coprostanoligenes group</italic> genus by 105.6-fold (Supplementary Table <xref rid=""MOESM2"" ref-type=""media"">1</xref>). The <italic toggle=""yes"">Tetragenococcus</italic> genus contains five lactic acid-producing species with probiotic potential<sup><xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR32"">32</xref></sup>, and the <italic toggle=""yes"">Tetragenococcus halophilus</italic> species has been shown to have beneficial immunomodulatory effects in vitro and in vivo<sup><xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR33"">33</xref></sup>. Acidified water in <italic toggle=""yes"">Cln2</italic><sup><italic toggle=""yes"">R207X</italic></sup> mice increased the abundance of the <italic toggle=""yes"">Tetragenococcus</italic> genus by 10.9-fold (Supplementary Table <xref rid=""MOESM2"" ref-type=""media"">1</xref>). Another change that might contribute to the beneficial effects of acidified water was a pronounced 34.9-fold decrease in the abundance of the pathogenic <italic toggle=""yes"">Clostridium sensu stricto 1</italic> genus (Supplementary Table <xref rid=""MOESM2"" ref-type=""media"">1</xref>).

"Efficacy of dual intracerebroventricular and intravitreal <italic toggle=""yes"">CLN5</italic> gene therapy in sheep prompts the first clinical trial to treat CLN5 Batten disease","Mutations in the <italic toggle=""yes"">CLN5</italic> gene cause the fatal, pediatric, neurodegenerative disease CLN5 neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis. Affected children suffer progressive neuronal loss, visual failure and premature death. Presently there is no treatment. This study evaluated dual intracerebroventricular (ICV) and intravitreal (IVT) administration of a self-complementary adeno-associated viral vector encoding ovine <italic toggle=""yes"">CLN5</italic> (scAAV9/oCLN5) into CLN5 affected sheep (CLN5<sup>−/−</sup>) at various disease stages. CLN5 disease progression was slowed in pre-symptomatic sheep who received a moderate dose of scAAV9/oCLN5, whilst a higher ICV dose treatment in early and advanced symptomatic animals delayed or halted disease progression. Intracranial (brain) volume loss was attenuated in all treatment cohorts, and visual function was also sustained in both the early and advanced symptomatic treated sheep over the 24-month duration of the study. Robust CLN5 protein expression was detected throughout the brain and spinal cord, and improvements in central nervous system and retinal disease correlates were observed. These findings hold translational promise for extending and improving the quality of life in both pre-symptomatic and symptomatic CLN5 patients, and prompted the initiation of the first in-human Phase I/II clinical trial testing ICV/IVT administration of scAAV9 encoding human <italic toggle=""yes"">CLN5</italic> (<ext-link http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink href=""https://clinicaltrials.gov/"" ext-link-type=""uri"">https://clinicaltrials.gov/</ext-link>; NCT05228145).","The neuronal ceroid lipofuscinoses (NCLs), also known as Batten disease, are a group of fatal neurodegenerative diseases, primarily affecting children; each form arising from mutations in any one of 13 <italic toggle=""yes"">CLN</italic> genes. Although more than 58 <italic toggle=""yes"">CLN5</italic> mutations result in a diverse range of age at symptom onset (infantile to early adult) and pathological and clinical presentations (<xref rid=""B2"" ref-type=""bibr"">Basak et al., 2021</xref>), initial symptoms that often appear around 5 years of age typically include developmental regression, seizure, ataxia, vision loss, and intellectual disability. Neuropathological features of CLN5 disease include cortical and retinal atrophy, astrocytosis, and accumulation of fluorescent lysosomal storage material (<xref rid=""B1"" ref-type=""bibr"">Autti et al., 1992</xref>; <xref rid=""B24"" ref-type=""bibr"">Tyynelä et al., 1997</xref>; <xref rid=""B7"" ref-type=""bibr"">Holmberg et al., 2000</xref>; <xref rid=""B23"" ref-type=""bibr"">Tyynelä et al., 2004</xref>; <xref rid=""B28"" ref-type=""bibr"">Xin et al., 2010</xref>). As with presentation and onset, life expectancy also varies with survival ranging from 10 to 30 years of age. At present, there is no treatment for CLN5 Batten disease. As a monogenic disease, it is attractive for gene therapy approaches. Moreover, for soluble lysosomal proteins, like CLN5, genetic correction of a small subset of neural cells is predicted to be sufficient to provide clinical benefit, as transduced cells can secrete CLN5 protein for uptake by neighboring protein-deficient cells (<xref rid=""B21"" ref-type=""bibr"">Sands and Davidson, 2006</xref>). Naturally occurring <italic toggle=""yes"">CLN5</italic> mutations have been identified in many species, including New Zealand Borderdale sheep (<xref rid=""B8"" ref-type=""bibr"">Jolly et al., 2002</xref>; <xref rid=""B5"" ref-type=""bibr"">Frugier et al., 2008</xref>). Affected sheep can be classified as CLN5-deficient (CLN5<sup>−/−</sup>) as the causative <italic toggle=""yes"">CLN5</italic> splice site mutation results in a premature stop codon and degradation of the mutant <italic toggle=""yes"">CLN5</italic> mRNA by nonsense-mediated decay so these animals express no, or very low levels, of truncated CLN5 protein. Prior studies in this model demonstrated the potential efficacy of <italic toggle=""yes"">CLN5</italic> gene therapy administered via both intracerebroventricular (ICV) and intraparenchymal (IP) injection in pre-symptomatic animals as well as those with early-stage disease (<xref rid=""B13"" ref-type=""bibr"">Mitchell et al., 2018</xref>). Development of neurological CLN5 disease was delayed; however, although vision failure was delayed compared with untreated CLN5 sheep, the treated sheep still ultimately went blind. Furthermore, disease progression and brain atrophy were attenuated in sheep with early-stage or even advanced-stage disease treated with ICV delivery of recombinant self-complementary AAV9 vectors expressing codon-optimized ovine <italic toggle=""yes"">CLN5</italic> (scAAV9/oCLN5) (<xref rid=""B13"" ref-type=""bibr"">Mitchell et al., 2018</xref>) (<xref rid=""B11"" ref-type=""bibr"">Mitchell et al., 2023a</xref>, manuscript co-submitted). In a separate study, intravitreal (IVT) administration of the same gene therapy vector ameliorated retinal function and structure in the treated eyes while the untreated eyes showed stereotypical loss of function and disease-associated pathology (<xref rid=""B15"" ref-type=""bibr"">Murray et al., 2021</xref>). However, as treated sheep did not receive brain-directed therapy, they still lost their vision, likely due to cortical blindness, and succumbed to the disease at 18 months of age. Although efficacy outcomes from the previous ICV-only and IVT-only scAAV9/oCLN5 gene therapy studies were promising, neither route of administration alone was sufficient to preserve both neurological and visual function. As such, the present study was undertaken to evaluate the impact of combined ICV and IVT administration of scAAV9/oCLN5 in affected sheep. Given the progressive nature of CLN5 Batten disease, early intervention is predicted to be the most efficacious; however, most human cases are diagnosed when patients are already symptomatic. Therefore, the effect of combined ICV and IVT scAAV9/oCLN5 administration was assessed at three previously identified disease stages–pre-symptomatic (3 months of age), early symptomatic (6 months of age), and advanced symptomatic (9 months of age) (<xref rid=""B12"" ref-type=""bibr"">Mitchell et al., 2023b</xref>). All sheep received the same IVT dose and pre-symptomatic sheep received the previously efficacious ICV dose (<xref rid=""B11"" ref-type=""bibr"">Mitchell et al., 2023a</xref>). Higher ICV doses were delivered to early and advanced symptomatic sheep in an effort to maximize efficacy. The data from these cohorts provide proof-of-concept for the gene therapy product, delivery route, therapeutic window with respect to disease state and allow evaluation of the long-term safety of the therapy and provide useful translational data regarding effective dose.   This study was the first to evaluate combined ICV/IVT administration of a gene therapy for CLN5 disease in a large animal model representing pre-symptomatic as well as early and advanced symptomatic stages. To date, nine CLN5<sup>−/−</sup> sheep have received the dual treatment with scAAV9/oCLN5, and a summary of the results is presented in <xref rid=""T1"" ref-type=""table"">Table 1</xref>. The dual treatment slowed disease progression, attenuated CLN5 disease pathology, and preserved vision. These data, combined with previous pre-clinical ICV studies in CLN5<sup>−/−</sup> sheep (<xref rid=""B13"" ref-type=""bibr"">Mitchell et al., 2018</xref>; <xref rid=""B11"" ref-type=""bibr"">Mitchell et al., 2023a</xref>), contributed to the clearance of the <italic toggle=""yes"">CLN5</italic> gene therapy product as an investigational new drug (IND) for the treatment of both the neurological and retinal components of human CLN5 Batten disease and supported the initiation of the current Phase I/II <italic toggle=""yes"">CLN5</italic> gene therapy clinical trial testing scAAV9/hCLN5 dual route ICV/IVT administration (Clinicaltrials.gov identifier: NCT05228145). The present study employed a naturally occurring sheep model of CLN5 Batten disease. Although a CLN5 exon 3 knock-out mouse model (<xref rid=""B9"" ref-type=""bibr"">Kopra et al., 2004</xref>) has provided insights into the spatiotemporal expression of CLN5 in the central nervous system (CNS) (<xref rid=""B6"" ref-type=""bibr"">Holmberg et al., 2004</xref>), these mice lack the severe brain atrophy characteristic of the sheep and human diseases. In contrast, CLN5<sup>−/−</sup> sheep share the main neuropathological features of the human disease, including progressive brain atrophy and loss of vision at approximately 11 months of age (<xref rid=""B8"" ref-type=""bibr"">Jolly et al., 2002</xref>; <xref rid=""B5"" ref-type=""bibr"">Frugier et al., 2008</xref>). In addition, sheep are similar in size to humans, weighing 3.5–4.5 kg at birth and growing to 80–110 kg in adulthood, with comparable spine dimensions, cerebrospinal fluid volumes, and pulmonary and cardiac parameters (<xref rid=""B26"" ref-type=""bibr"">Wilke et al., 1997</xref>; <xref rid=""B22"" ref-type=""bibr"">Scheerlinck et al., 2008</xref>; <xref rid=""B27"" ref-type=""bibr"">Wilson et al., 2017</xref>). Furthermore, the gyrencephalic ovine brain is similar in physical organization to the human brain and in size to non-human primate brains, providing a good approximation for dose requirements, vector delivery, and distribution to inform clinical translation. Previous studies have shown that delivery of <italic toggle=""yes"">CLN5</italic> gene therapy to the CLN5<sup>−/−</sup> sheep brain via ICV administration alone is sufficient to halt or slow disease onset and progression, intracranial volume loss, and ameliorate disease pathology (<xref rid=""B13"" ref-type=""bibr"">Mitchell et al., 2018</xref>; <xref rid=""B11"" ref-type=""bibr"">Mitchell et al., 2023a</xref>). The results of this study indicate a dose-dependent transduction efficiency and correlated improved efficacy with the high ICV dose in the early and advanced symptomatic sheep as compared with the moderate dose evaluated in the pre-symptomatic animals. Pre-symptomatic sheep received a ten-fold lower ICV dose than the other treatment groups, which normalized their intracranial volumes but resulted in the greatest rate of clinical decline from injection (−0.5 oBDRS points per month compared with no average change in the older symptomatic treated cohorts). Immunohistochemical analyses of CNS tissues demonstrated far fewer CLN5-positive cells in the pre-symptomatic treated cohort, reflecting their lesser ICV dose. Previous attempts at a moderate dose ICV delivery (2.4 × 10<sup>11</sup> vg) in 9-month-old CLN5<sup>−/−</sup> sheep with advanced disease symptoms resulted in only one animal responding favorably (<xref rid=""B11"" ref-type=""bibr"">Mitchell et al., 2023a</xref>). In the current study, however, a higher dose was administered to symptomatic sheep, and all three of the early symptomatic treated sheep and two of the three advanced symptomatic treated sheep were clinically stable at 24 months of age. The third advanced symptomatic sheep presented with only mild decline. In addition, the brains of sheep treated at early and advanced symptomatic stages had extensive cortical CLN5 transduction, only mild neuroinflammation and significantly reduced lysosomal storage compared with age-matched untreated CLN5<sup>−/−</sup> sheep. Regions like the primary motor, visual and parieto-occipital cortices and hippocampus were particularly well-targeted by the ICV delivery, and at the higher dose, CLN5-positive cells were evident along the full length of the spinal cord. The relative success of this higher dose ICV treatment in both early and advanced symptomatic sheep is extremely promising for its translation to symptomatic CLN5 patients. Although all nine sheep received the same IVT dose, greater attenuation of retinal pathology was observed in sheep treated at the later disease stages (6 and 9 months) with a higher ICV dose compared with those treated at the pre-symptomatic stage with a lower ICV dose. Five out of six sheep in the symptomatic cohorts had thicker total retina and outer nuclear layers in the treated eyes; however, retinal thinning and lysosomal storage was attenuated in both eyes (treated and untreated) compared with untreated CLN5<sup>−/−</sup> sheep. One possible mechanism is that retrograde axonal transport of the vector from the brain to the eye, via the optic nerve, is occurring and this might explain why the animals with the higher ICV brain doses showed the greatest functional and pathological correction in the retina. CLN5-positive transduced cells were found throughout key visual pathway structures in the brain, including the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) and primary visual cortex, therefore it is possible that this retrograde transport occurs between the LGN, where ganglion cells terminate, and the retina, where ganglion cell bodies are located. Natural history electroretinography studies in untreated CLN5<sup>−/−</sup> sheep showed that retinal dysfunction begins around 5 months of age (<xref rid=""B20"" ref-type=""bibr"">Russell et al., 2021</xref>), and this dysfunction is accompanied by progressive loss of vulnerable neurons in the primary visual cortex and outer nuclear layer and photoreceptor cells in the retina (<xref rid=""B14"" ref-type=""bibr"">Murray and Mitchell, 2022</xref>; <xref rid=""B12"" ref-type=""bibr"">Mitchell et al., 2023b</xref>). IVT administration alone was not sufficient to prevent vision loss in CLN5<sup>−/−</sup> sheep, likely due to cortical blindness since the CNS remained untreated (<xref rid=""B15"" ref-type=""bibr"">Murray et al., 2021</xref>). However, both moderate- and high-dose ICV delivery of <italic toggle=""yes"">CLN5</italic> gene therapy likely prevented the cortical neurodegenerative-driven blindness seen in untreated CLN5<sup>−/−</sup> sheep as all treated animals had improved visual function compared with untreated controls, confirming the importance of treating the CNS in combination with the eye to prevent loss of visual function. Moreover, IVT delivery may have impacted different aspects of retinal pathology, such as retinal thinning and lysosomal storage, compared to ICV administration. Immunohistochemical localisation of CLN5 protein in the sheep retina has not been possible to date. Currently available antibodies against ovine CLN5 work in central nervous system tissues but do not produce staining in the retina, making it difficult to assess number and types of cells transduced in the current study. In NCLs, even minor increases in functional protein levels have been shown to be effective in correcting phenotype (<xref rid=""B17"" ref-type=""bibr"">Parenti et al., 2015</xref>); therefore, the IVT delivery route may transduce the inner retinal cells layers, such as the ganglion cell layer, and the transduced cells secrete sufficient CLN5 protein to protect outer retinal cells, including the photoreceptors, which are severely compromised in CLN5 patients. The first of two IND-enabling studies in CLN5<sup>−/−</sup> sheep demonstrated the long-term safety and efficacy of ICV scAAV9/oCLN5 gene therapy when delivered at pre-symptomatic, early symptomatic, and more advanced symptomatic disease stages (<xref rid=""B11"" ref-type=""bibr"">Mitchell et al., 2023a</xref>). Here, the second study demonstrated proof-of-concept for the dual ICV/IVT delivery route. Disease progression and stereotypical brain atrophy were significantly slowed, and disease-associated pathology was greatly attenuated with the combined routes of gene therapy. Vision was preserved in the majority of treated sheep up to 24 months of age with improvements in retinal pathology and function. Doses used in sheep in the current study will be used to extrapolate optimal doses for the Phase I/II clinical trial, with brain volume selected as the most reliable dosing metric. Collectively, these findings indicate great translational promise for extending and improving vision and other core symptoms in both pre-symptomatic and symptomatic CLN5 patients.",N/A,24 10 2023
Assessment of Safety and Biodistribution of AAVrh.10hCLN2 Following Intracisternal Administration in Nonhuman Primates for the Treatment of CLN2 Batten Disease,"CLN2 disease is a fatal, childhood autosomal recessive disorder caused by mutations in ceroid lipofuscinosis type 2 (CLN2) gene, encoding tripeptidyl peptidase 1 (TPP-1). Loss of TPP-1 activity leads to accumulation of storage material in lysosomes and resultant neuronal cell death with neurodegeneration. Genotype/phenotype comparisons suggest that the phenotype should be ameliorated with increase of TPP-1 levels to 5–10% of normal with wide central nervous system (CNS) distribution. Our previous clinical study showed that intraparenchymal (IPC) administration of AAVrh.10hCLN2, an adeno-associated vector serotype rh.10 encoding human CLN2, slowed, but did not stop disease progression, suggesting that this may be insufficient to distribute the therapy throughout the CNS (Sondhi 2020). In this study, we assessed whether the less invasive intracisternal delivery route would be safe and provide a wider distribution of TPP-1. A study was conducted in nonhuman primates (NHPs) with intracisternal delivery to cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of AAVrh.10hCLN2 (5 × 10<sup>13</sup> genome copies) or phosphate buffered saline (PBS). No abnormal behavior was noted. CNS magnetic resonance imaging and clinical chemistry data were all unremarkable. Histopathology of major organs had no abnormal finding attributable to the intervention or the vector, except that in one out of two animals treated with AAVrh.10hCLN2, dorsal root ganglia showed mild-to-moderate mononuclear cell infiltrates and neuronal degeneration. In contrast to our previous NHP study (Sondhi 2012) with IPC administration where TPP-1 activity was >2 × above controls in 30% of treated brains, in the two intracisternal treated NHPs, the TPP-1 activity was >2 × above controls in 50% and 41% of treated brains, and 52% and 84% of brain had >1,000 vector genomes/μg DNA, compared to 0% in the two PBS NHP. CSF TPP1 levels in treated animals were 43–62% of normal human levels. Collectively, these data indicate that AAVrh.10hCLN2 delivered by intracisternal route is safe and widely distributes TPP-1 in brain and CSF at levels that are potentially therapeutic.",Full text not available in PMC,N/A,01 9 2023 September 2023
"Assessing the integrity of auditory sensory memory processing in CLN<italic toggle=""yes"">3</italic> disease (Juvenile Neuronal Ceroid Lipofuscinosis (Batten disease)): An auditory evoked potential study of the duration-evoked mismatch negativity (MMN)",,"CLN3 disease, also known as juvenile neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis (JNCL – Batten disease), is a childhood-onset neurodegenerative disorder resulting from pathogenic variants in <italic toggle=""yes"">CLN3</italic> that lead to the pathological accumulation of ceroid lipofuscin in lysosomes of multiple cell types, with neurons displaying particular vulnerability [<xref rid=""R1"" ref-type=""bibr"">1</xref>] [<xref rid=""R2"" ref-type=""bibr"">2</xref>]. CLN3 disease is one condition in a genetically heterogeneous class of rare neuronal lysosomal storage disorders, collectively known as neuronal ceroid lipofuscinoses (NCLs). While individually rare, collectively the NCLs constitute the leading known cause of childhood neurodegenerative disorders worldwide [<xref rid=""R1"" ref-type=""bibr"">1</xref>] [<xref rid=""R3"" ref-type=""bibr"">3</xref>]. Symptoms typically onset between 4–7 years of age, with progressive neurodegeneration persisting for approximately 20–25 years, leading to premature mortality [<xref rid=""R4"" ref-type=""bibr"">4</xref>] [<xref rid=""R5"" ref-type=""bibr"">5</xref>] [<xref rid=""R6"" ref-type=""bibr"">6</xref>]. The most common initial symptom is a loss of vision that progresses to severe blindness within 2–4 years, which is typically followed by cognitive decline, onset of seizures and Parkinsonism [<xref rid=""R7"" ref-type=""bibr"">7</xref>] [<xref rid=""R8"" ref-type=""bibr"">8</xref>] [<xref rid=""R9"" ref-type=""bibr"">9</xref>] [<xref rid=""R4"" ref-type=""bibr"">4</xref>]. Throughout adolescence and early adulthood, there is progressive loss of cognitive functioning, speech and motor skills [<xref rid=""R5"" ref-type=""bibr"">5</xref>] [<xref rid=""R6"" ref-type=""bibr"">6</xref>] [<xref rid=""R10"" ref-type=""bibr"">10</xref>]. Because of the combination of progressive vision loss, motor dysfunction, and cognitive decline, it can be challenging to accurately assess the extent of the progressive neurocognitive decline in this population as the disease takes its course, since the administration of conventional cognitive evaluations that require visual presentation of information is not feasible [<xref rid=""R11"" ref-type=""bibr"">11</xref>]. As such, there is limited knowledge about perceptual and cognitive capabilities across the progressive clinical stages of <italic toggle=""yes"">CLN3</italic> disease. The consequences of these limitations affect both clinical evaluation and examination of efficacy during clinical trials. There is a pressing need to identify specific quantitative measures of brain function (i.e., neuromarkers or endophenotypes) that could be tracked objectively across the natural course of <italic toggle=""yes"">CLN3</italic> disease. Such measures would mitigate subjective outcome associated with conventional cognitive evaluation, serve as surrogate biomarkers of disease severity and could provide more precise evidence of treatment effects. Event-related potential (ERP) recordings are an increasingly appealing option in both human patients and animal models of rare diseases [<xref rid=""R12"" ref-type=""bibr"">12</xref>] [<xref rid=""R13"" ref-type=""bibr"">13</xref>] [<xref rid=""R14"" ref-type=""bibr"">14</xref>] [<xref rid=""R15"" ref-type=""bibr"">15</xref>] [<xref rid=""R16"" ref-type=""bibr"">16</xref>] [<xref rid=""R17"" ref-type=""bibr"">17</xref>] [<xref rid=""R18"" ref-type=""bibr"">18</xref>]. This easy-to-apply non-invasive technique provides the opportunity to acquire objective quantitative measures of brain activity, including cortical network dynamics, without the need for overt behavioral responses from participants (e.g. [<xref rid=""R19"" ref-type=""bibr"">19</xref>] [<xref rid=""R20"" ref-type=""bibr"">20</xref>] [<xref rid=""R21"" ref-type=""bibr"">21</xref>]), and its exquisite temporal resolution allows for assessment of information flow across the cortical hierarchy, from sensory to perceptual to cognitive stages of processing [<xref rid=""R22"" ref-type=""bibr"">22</xref>]. Since the peripheral visual system is affected severely and early in <italic toggle=""yes"">CLN3</italic> disease, primarily due to macular dystrophy [<xref rid=""R23"" ref-type=""bibr"">23</xref>], here we deployed the ERP technique to measure auditory sensory-perceptual processing as a means to assess the integrity of early cortical processing in <italic toggle=""yes"">CLN3</italic> disease. This is an important point, since the intention here is to specifically test central cortical processing. As such, the presence of variable peripheral deficits means that visual stimulation cannot be reasonably used to assay the integrity of cortical processing. In contrast, the peripheral auditory system appears to be intact in CLN3 disease, and as such, stimulation can be fatefully delivered to assess central processing dynamics. The integrity of early auditory processing, auditory discrimination, and sensory memory can be studied by recording the well-characterized mismatch negativity (MMN) component of the ERP [<xref rid=""R24"" ref-type=""bibr"">24</xref>] [<xref rid=""R25"" ref-type=""bibr"">25</xref>] . MMN is evoked pre-attentively by introducing occasional changes (deviants) in a regularly occurring stream of auditory inputs, typically by manipulating features such as frequency, location, loudness, phonemic boundaries or duration [<xref rid=""R26"" ref-type=""bibr"">26</xref>] [<xref rid=""R27"" ref-type=""bibr"">27</xref>] [<xref rid=""R28"" ref-type=""bibr"">28</xref>]. MMN experimental designs do not require participant engagement or the ability to follow complex tasks, which makes them ideal for assessment of individuals with limited attention or cognitive impairments. The fact that the MMN has been shown to be generated pre-attentively (automatically) is a key factor in its use in clinical conditions where cognition and attentional functioning is compromised, since its generation does not require engagement with the inputs, and individuals can be engaged in other activities (e.g., reading a book, watching a movie, and even in performing a demanding visual task). A substantial literature has shown that MMN generation to simple feature deviants like “duration” are pre-attentively generated and that attention does not detectably modulate the component [<xref rid=""R29"" ref-type=""bibr"">29</xref>] [<xref rid=""R30"" ref-type=""bibr"">30</xref>] [<xref rid=""R31"" ref-type=""bibr"">31</xref>] [<xref rid=""R32"" ref-type=""bibr"">32</xref>] [<xref rid=""R33"" ref-type=""bibr"">33</xref>] [<xref rid=""R34"" ref-type=""bibr"">34</xref>]. Here, we set out to interrogate auditory sensory memory capabilities in individuals with CLN3 disease, specifically for the feature of “duration” processing, an important cue in speech perception and consequently in task performance [<xref rid=""R35"" ref-type=""bibr"">35</xref>] [<xref rid=""R36"" ref-type=""bibr"">36</xref>] [<xref rid=""R37"" ref-type=""bibr"">37</xref>]. Our primary hypothesis was that the duration-evoked MMN would be reduced in amplitude in CLN3 disease. Based on prior work by our research group using this identical paradigm in multiple other rare disease populations (Rett Syndrome [<xref rid=""R12"" ref-type=""bibr"">12</xref>]; 22Q11 deletion syndrome [<xref rid=""R38"" ref-type=""bibr"">38</xref>]; and Cystinosis [<xref rid=""R13"" ref-type=""bibr"">13</xref>] [<xref rid=""R39"" ref-type=""bibr"">39</xref>]) and in neurotypical controls [<xref rid=""R40"" ref-type=""bibr"">40</xref>], we had clear precedence to define both the electrodes where the duration MMN is seen to be maximal over frontal scalp (F3, FZ and F4) and the appropriate timeframe within which to make measurements of its maximal amplitude (~200–240 ms). An additional design feature of our paradigm was the use of three different rates of stimulation (fast: 450 ms, medium: 900 ms, slow: 1800 ms). This manipulation allows for assessment of the sustainability and robustness of the auditory sensory memory trace, as the amplitude of MMN is directly related to the rate at which the regularly occurring stream of stimuli is presented [<xref rid=""R41"" ref-type=""bibr"">41</xref>] [<xref rid=""R42"" ref-type=""bibr"">42</xref>]. That is, when stimuli occur at a rapid rate, the occasional deviants are highly detectable and tend to “pop out” from the background sequence, evoking a robust MMN. As the rate of presentation is slowed, however, the robustness of the sensory memory trace is diminished, the deviant stimulus does not pop out in a highly discriminable manner, and the MMN is reduced or even absent. Thus, by manipulating presentation rate, one can parametrically vary the strength of the sensory memory trace, providing a greater degree of sensitivity for detecting potential auditory cortical dysfunction. Therefore, our secondary hypothesis was that compared to TD controls, duration-evoked MMN amplitude reductions in CLN3 disease would be more pronounced at the slower presentation rates, where greater demand was placed on the sensory memory system. Finally, since recruitment of participants in rare diseases like CLN3 disease necessitates inclusion of individuals across a large age-range in order to ensure an adequately powered study and to study the progressive stages of the disease, age must also be a consideration in subsequent analyses. It is well-known that auditory responses continue to mature with typical development across age [<xref rid=""R43"" ref-type=""bibr"">43</xref>] [<xref rid=""R44"" ref-type=""bibr"">44</xref>] [<xref rid=""R45"" ref-type=""bibr"">45</xref>], we therefore assessed whether the robustness of the MMN would increase with age in these cohorts.  <xref rid=""F1"" ref-type=""fig"">Figure 1</xref> displays the ERPs elicited by standard and deviant tones for each group as a function of stimulation rate, and the corresponding difference waveforms, over frontal scalp sites (averaged over; F3, Fz, and F4). As expected, TDs show clear canonical MMN responses with a robust negativity in the period from 200 ms - 240 ms post stimulus onset across all SOAs. MMNs to the fast (450 ms) and medium (900 ms) SOA conditions are also evident in the waveform comparisons for the CLN3 disease group, but at the slowest rate (1800 ms), there is no clear MMN in evidence. The MMNs in TDs showed the typical topographic distribution, with a prominent fronto-central negative distribution, accompanied by bilateral positivity over the mastoids (<xref rid=""F2"" ref-type=""fig"">Figure 2</xref>), consistent with main generators of the duration MMN in auditory cortices along the supra-temporal plane [<xref rid=""R49"" ref-type=""bibr"">49</xref>]. Despite weaker magnitudes, individuals with CLN3 disease produced somewhat similar topographical distributions, although at the slowest rate (SOA = 1800 ms), the typical fronto-central distribution was not present (<xref rid=""F2"" ref-type=""fig"">Figure 2</xref>, Panel C). The aim of the current study was to utilize the amplitude of the mismatch negativity (MMN) component to assess auditory sensory memory for duration in individuals with CLN3 disease, on the premise that this easy-to-test neurophysiological marker might be sensitive to subtle changes in auditory cortical processing in this progressive neurodevelopmental disorder. Linear mixed effect analysis pointed to an MMN that was intact in the clinical group for medium presentation rates (900 ms SOA), reflecting a generally preserved ability to discriminate auditory duration deviance and to establish auditory sensory memories. However, the MMN was quite clearly compromised at longer (slower) presentation rates (i.e., the 1800 ms SOA) as greater demand was placed on the sensory memory system, in line with our main hypothesis. Results also suggested that at the most rapid stimulation rate (450 ms SOA), the MMN was weaker in the CLN3 cohort, an effect that was not predicted. Finally, we found that age significantly predicted neurophysiological correlates of sensory memory in CLN3 disease – that is, that the MMN showed a progressive reduction in amplitude with increasing age (i.e., disease progression), exactly opposite to what was observed in TD control participants. In what follows, we describe these results in more detail. First, there was a significant positive relationship between TD and CLN3 participants demonstrating that overall neurophysiological responsivity was relatively comparable across groups as a function of condition, although the absolute group MMN means were significantly different between each cohort. In addition, the <italic toggle=""yes"">a priori</italic> hypothesis that age would be significantly related to the MMN effect was supported as the overall fit of the model improved when age was added as a covariate. Additionally, there was a main effect for DEV vs STD trials which further demonstrated that there was an overall generalized MMN effect across both participant groups. A key finding was that presentation rate (i.e., the variation in SOA) was a significant predictor of participant group, indicative of an interaction between groups as a function of rate of presentation. When exploring this further using age as a fixed effect, the results showed that there was only a significant difference between the fast and medium SOAs (i.e., 450 ms and 900 ms), but not between the fast and slow SOAs (i.e., 450 ms and 1800 ms) or slow and medium SOAs (i.e., 1800 ms and 900 ms). This suggested that the MMN in CLN3 participants was equally disrupted in the fast and slow presentation rates and the largest gap in auditory sensory memory performance was between the fast and the medium presentation rates. Next, using a within-subjects model to explicitly test for the MMN effect in the CLN3 group, no significant difference between DEV vs STD trials (i.e., MMN effect) was observed at both the fast and slow presentation rates, whereas there was a robust MMN effect at the medium SOA rate. In partial contrast to the LME results, exploratory <italic toggle=""yes"">post-hoc</italic> cluster statistics did show a significant MMN effect at the fast presentation rate in CLN3, whereas both statistical approaches showed no evidence of an MMN at the slowest rate. This difference in absence and presence of MMN effect at the fastest presentation rate (SOA = 450 ms) is most likely due to the inherent methodological differences in these statistical approaches [<xref rid=""R67"" ref-type=""bibr"">67</xref>] . The computation of cluster-based statistics takes into consideration adjacent temporal and spatial information and uses cluster-based correction methods to account for multiple comparisons, while the LME approach relies on specific time-windows of interest at a fixed region of interest (i.e., pre-specified electrodes). Additionally, the LME model used age as a covariate. Lastly, it is worth noting that while the MMN was not strictly significant at the 450 ms SOA in CLN3, it did approach conventional levels of significance in the LME (<italic toggle=""yes"">p</italic> = 0.053) and Bayesian analysis pointed to moderate evidence for an MMN at this presentation rate. When focusing on the TD cohort, the MMN was clearly present and highly stable across all SOAs, as expected. Prior work has shown that the strength of the MMN is highly dependent on stimulation rate, with reduced MMN responses observed at slower rates [<xref rid=""R41"" ref-type=""bibr"">41</xref>] [<xref rid=""R42"" ref-type=""bibr"">42</xref>] [<xref rid=""R68"" ref-type=""bibr"">68</xref>]. Current understanding of this phenomenon is that the strength of the auditory sensory memory depends on a temporal integration window, such that establishment of a robust sensory memory depends on the presentation of a number of standards within this window, against which the deviant will ultimately be compared. Perceptually, this is very obvious in a design such as the one used here. At rapid rates of presentation (e.g., (SOA of 450 ms)), the duration deviant pops out strongly from the rapid stream of standards, whereas when the rate of presentation is slowed (SOA 1800 ms here), this pop-out is diminished. In extremis, the reader can readily imagine that if the standard tones were presented once per minute or at even longer lags, it would become very difficult to determine a duration deviant relative to these sporadic standards, and this would certainly not be achieved automatically (pre-attentively). The fact that duration MMN is absent at the slowest and most demanding presentation rate here in CLN3 disease, may point to the early stages of a breakdown in automatic detection and integration of these stimuli in auditory sensory memory. It is also worth pointing out here that the presence or absence of an MMN during passive tasks is known to correspond closely with behavioral performance when individuals are asked to actively discriminate the deviants in follow-up behavioral studies. Only deviants that can be discriminated above chance levels are found to also evoke MMN responses [<xref rid=""R68"" ref-type=""bibr"">68</xref>] [<xref rid=""R69"" ref-type=""bibr"">69</xref>]. We did not behaviorally assess auditory discrimination abilities of the participants given the associated loss of vision, speech, and motor decline. Many of the participants with CLN3 disease would not have been able to perform the task. Rather, we employed the passive MMN design to assess the evoked neural activity. It will fall to future work to determine what the perceptual and cognitive implications of this breakdown are [<xref rid=""R10"" ref-type=""bibr"">10</xref>] [<xref rid=""R11"" ref-type=""bibr"">11</xref>] [<xref rid=""R70"" ref-type=""bibr"">70</xref>]. However, prior work has shown that weakened ability to sustain information in sensory memory can reflect cognitive deterioration in various clinical conditions [<xref rid=""R42"" ref-type=""bibr"">42</xref>] [<xref rid=""R45"" ref-type=""bibr"">45</xref>] [<xref rid=""R46"" ref-type=""bibr"">46</xref>]. It will also be of significant interest to further investigate the duration-evoked MMN at even slower presentation rates. This may better reveal the extent of this difference, and it remains to be determined whether this difference is peculiar to the feature of duration or if it will also be evident for other basic auditory features such as pitch, loudness and location. Manipulations of presentation rate are not the only way in which the auditory sensory memory system can be parametrically manipulated. Whereas the presentation rate manipulation used here is presumed to test the temporal integration window of the MMN system, the sensitivity of the system can also be assessed by manipulating the extent to which the deviant stimulus differs from the standards. Here, a deviant of 180ms was used against a standard tone of 100ms, which represents a large and highly discriminable duration change known to evoke large amplitude MMN responses in neurotypical controls [<xref rid=""R50"" ref-type=""bibr"">50</xref>]. By parametrically manipulating the extent of the duration deviance, prior work has shown that the amplitude of the MMN tracks with the size of the difference, such that at small differences (e.g. 130ms versus 100ms), the MMN is highly diminished or even absent in neurotypical controls [<xref rid=""R50"" ref-type=""bibr"">50</xref>]. There are parallels between the current findings of diminished MMN responses at slower presentation rates and prior work in other rare neurodevelopmental diseases, specifically Rett Syndrome (RTT) and Cystinosis [<xref rid=""R12"" ref-type=""bibr"">12</xref>] [<xref rid=""R13"" ref-type=""bibr"">13</xref>]. In Rett participants, for example, the duration-evoked MMN was only detected when stimuli were presented at the most rapid presentation rate of 450 ms SOA, and unlike the CLN3 disease participants reported here, no MMN was evident at the 900 ms SOA, nor at the 1800 ms SOA, suggesting a more severe disease course in this population. Likewise, participants diagnosed with Cystinosis, another of the rare lysosomal storage disorders, produced robust MMNs comparable to those seen in TDs only in response to the fastest presentation rate (i.e., at 450 ms SOA) [<xref rid=""R13"" ref-type=""bibr"">13</xref>], with clear atypicalities in the MMN at the two slower rates 900 ms SOA and 1800 ms SOA). Taken together, these data suggest that the duration-evoked MMN may be a sensitive measure of disease severity across a number of neurodevelopmental disorders. An unanticipated finding here was the weakened MMN response in CLN3 disease at the fastest presentation rate (i.e., the 450 ms SOA). This is the rate at which one expects the most robust MMN to be produced, whereas it was at the medium rate (900 ms SOA) that this occurred in CLN3. Since this was not explicitly predicted, the effect warrants replication in an independent cohort before any strong conclusions can be drawn. Nonetheless, these data suggest that there may be an emerging deficit in the ability to generate auditory sensory memories for duration at rapid presentation rates in CLN3 disease. Clinically, some of the most striking differences observed in individuals with CLN3 disease are in memory, attention and speech functions [<xref rid=""R5"" ref-type=""bibr"">5</xref>] [<xref rid=""R6"" ref-type=""bibr"">6</xref>] [<xref rid=""R10"" ref-type=""bibr"">10</xref>] [<xref rid=""R11"" ref-type=""bibr"">11</xref>]. This cognitive decline generally begins around the time of onset of vision impairment, but continues to progress over years, even after vision loss is maximal [<xref rid=""R9"" ref-type=""bibr"">9</xref>] [<xref rid=""R71"" ref-type=""bibr"">71</xref>]. To date, quantitative characterization of these differences has not been well-defined [<xref rid=""R11"" ref-type=""bibr"">11</xref>]. As such, the relationships between cognitive impairments and other clinical features of CLN3 disease are not yet well understood. For instance, the onset of visual decline and of cognitive deterioration have been a subject of debate [<xref rid=""R72"" ref-type=""bibr"">72</xref>]. It is generally accepted that the onset of observable cognitive decline begins within two years of the onset of visual decline [<xref rid=""R72"" ref-type=""bibr"">72</xref>] [<xref rid=""R10"" ref-type=""bibr"">10</xref>]. This has been shown in some individuals with CLN3 disease, while in others, this decline seemed to precede visual deterioration or even emerge at a much later stage [<xref rid=""R73"" ref-type=""bibr"">73</xref>] [<xref rid=""R74"" ref-type=""bibr"">74</xref>] [<xref rid=""R75"" ref-type=""bibr"">75</xref>] [<xref rid=""R76"" ref-type=""bibr"">76</xref>]. These inconsistencies in the manifestation of the onset of cognitive decline were taken to highlight the importance of careful acquisition of patient history in those suspected to have CLN3 disease [<xref rid=""R72"" ref-type=""bibr"">72</xref>]. Similarly, understanding the extent of cognitive regression in CLN3 disease is an important component in identifying reliable neurophysiological biomarkers of this disease. As far as we know, the use of electrophysiological assays to evaluate cognitive abilities including attention and memory has not yet been leveraged in this population. The current work serves as a good first step in exploring and developing objective neural markers of pathology (biomarkers) that can be easily carried out noninvasively throughout the progressive stages of CLN3 disease. Genetically manipulated mouse models of disease are remarkably powerful research tools, providing essential insights into the neurobiological substrates of neurodevelopmental disorders like CLN3 disease [<xref rid=""R77"" ref-type=""bibr"">77</xref>] [<xref rid=""R78"" ref-type=""bibr"">78</xref>] [<xref rid=""R79"" ref-type=""bibr"">79</xref>], and yet many of the outcome measures used to quantify or track disease progression in a mouse cannot be meaningfully applied in human. Obviously enough, invasive electrophysiological recordings, ubiquitous in model systems work, are not feasible in humans. Similarly, many of the behavioral assays used to assess disease progression and severity in a mouse are only loosely related to human behaviors [<xref rid=""R80"" ref-type=""bibr"">80</xref>], and higher-order functions such as cognitive control and language cannot be readily interrogated. Establishing objective neurophysiological markers of disease progression in human patients is a crucial step towards bridging this inter-species translational divide. In humans, measures of brain electrophysiology are almost exclusively made using non-invasive scalp recordings that assay the activity of large distributed neuronal ensembles across the entire brain (i.e., circuit-level analysis). In mouse models, typical assays involve single or multi-unit neuronal recordings in vivo (usually in anesthetized preparations) or in vitro slice preparations where synaptic plasticity can be assessed. Again, while the approaches used in each species are certainly powerful in their own right, the researcher is mostly left to infer or speculate about correspondences across species. However, ERP markers like the MMN can be readily recorded in mice using wholly similar, if not identical experimental procedures [<xref rid=""R81"" ref-type=""bibr"">81</xref>] [<xref rid=""R82"" ref-type=""bibr"">82</xref>]. It will be important to determine going forward whether in mouse models of Batten disease, the MMN phenotype seen here can be recapitulated. If so, it will present as an excellent cross-species neuromarker. ",N/A,17 8 2023
Long-term safety and dose escalation of intracerebroventricular CLN5 gene therapy in sheep supports clinical translation for CLN5 Batten disease,"CLN5 neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis (NCL, Batten disease) is a rare, inherited fatal neurodegenerative disorder caused by mutations in the <italic toggle=""yes"">CLN5</italic> gene. The disease is characterised by progressive neuronal loss, blindness, and premature death. There is no cure. This study evaluated the efficacy of intracerebroventricular (ICV) delivery of an adeno-associated viral vector encoding ovine <italic toggle=""yes"">CLN5</italic> (scAAV9/oCLN5) in a naturally occurring sheep model of CLN5 disease. CLN5 affected (CLN5<sup>−/−</sup>) sheep received low, moderate, or high doses of scAAV9/oCLN5 at three disease stages. The treatment delayed disease progression, extended survival and slowed stereotypical brain atrophy in most animals. Of note, one high dose treated animal only developed mild disease symptomology and survived to 60.1 months of age, triple the natural life expectancy of an untreated CLN5<sup>−/−</sup> sheep. Eyesight was not preserved at any administration age or dosage. Histopathologic examination revealed that greater transduction efficiency was achieved through higher ICV doses, and this resulted in greater amelioration of disease pathology. Together with other pre-clinical data from CLN5<sup>−/−</sup> sheep, the safety and efficacy data from these investigational new drug (IND)-enabling studies supported the initiation of the first in-human CLN5 gene therapy clinical study using the ICV delivery route for the treatment of CLN5 NCL.

Few effective treatments exist; the disease is presently fatal. Variant late-infantile NCL or CLN5 disease is caused by autosomal-recessive mutations in the <italic toggle=""yes"">CLN5</italic> gene. Whilst the function of this gene is unclear, it is known to encode a glycosylated, soluble non-enzymatic lysosomal protein (<xref rid=""B11"" ref-type=""bibr"">Isosomppi et al., 2002</xref>). Human CLN5 disease usually presents with motor dysfunction and impaired cognition between 1.5 and 8 years of age (<xref rid=""B37"" ref-type=""bibr"">Xin et al., 2010</xref>; <xref rid=""B21"" ref-type=""bibr"">Mole and Williams, 2013</xref>; <xref rid=""B34"" ref-type=""bibr"">Simonati et al., 2017</xref>), followed by progressive visual decline, seizures and dementia leading to premature death between the ages of 14–36 years (<xref rid=""B25"" ref-type=""bibr"">Nita et al., 2016</xref>; <xref rid=""B34"" ref-type=""bibr"">Simonati et al., 2017</xref>). A naturally occurring sheep model of CLN5 NCL exists in New Zealand Borderdale sheep (<xref rid=""B12"" ref-type=""bibr"">Jolly et al., 2002</xref>; <xref rid=""B5"" ref-type=""bibr"">Frugier et al., 2008</xref>). Affected animals exhibit a human CLN5 disease-like phenotype including progressive brain atrophy and loss of vision from 11 to 12 months of age, and a shortened life span of <22 months (<xref rid=""B12"" ref-type=""bibr"">Jolly et al., 2002</xref>; <xref rid=""B5"" ref-type=""bibr"">Frugier et al., 2008</xref>). This sheep model has served as a powerful tool in the development and validation of a translational brain-directed CLN5 gene therapy product. For soluble lysosomal proteins, like CLN5, cross-correction of a small subset of neural cells is predicted to be sufficient to restore 5%–10% normal protein activity to facilitate normal cellular function (<xref rid=""B32"" ref-type=""bibr"">Sands and Davidson, 2006</xref>). Indeed, the single administration of brain-directed lentiviral or recombinant adeno-associated virus 9 (AAV9) vectors expressing ovine <italic toggle=""yes"">CLN5</italic> to CLN5 affected sheep resulted in long-term neurological disease attenuation (<xref rid=""B19"" ref-type=""bibr"">Mitchell et al., 2018</xref>). The intracerebroventricular (ICV) delivery route resulted in transduced corrected cells throughout the central nervous system, which were theoretically secreting CLN5 protein for uptake by neighbouring protein-deficient cells, thus providing surrounding cells and tissue with a continuous supply of soluble functional protein. This provided the first pressing case for translation of a CLN5 gene therapy product to human patients. To further investigate the timing and optimal dose of an ICV treatment, cohorts of CLN5 affected sheep were treated with variable doses of recombinant self-complementary AAV9 vectors expressing codon-optimized ovine <italic toggle=""yes"">CLN5</italic> (scAAV9/oCLN5) at three different disease stages. Pre-symptomatic treatment was assessed in three cohorts of sheep at approximately 3 months of age at a low [LD; 8.0–8.2 × 10<sup>10</sup> viral genomes (vg)] or moderate dose (MD, 2.4 × 10<sup>11</sup> vg). Early symptomatic treatment was administered at 6–7 months of age with a similar MD (2.7 × 10<sup>11</sup> vg) or high dose (HD; 2.8 × 10<sup>12</sup> vg). Finally advanced symptomatic treatment was administered with a MD of 2.7 × 10<sup>11</sup> vg of scAAV9/oCLN5 in 9-month-old CLN5 affected sheep. Sheep were regularly monitored until they were euthanized for humane reasons, at ages ranging from 18.5 to 60.1 months of age. The extensive in-life and neuropathological data from these cohorts provide further proof-of-concept for the gene therapy and delivery route and support its clinical translation. Importantly, this study was the first of two investigational new drug (IND)-enabling studies in sheep providing long-term and safety efficacy data on the CLN5 gene therapy product and useful translational data regarding the therapeutic window and effective ICV dosage.   These studies provide pre-clinical proof-of-concept data which supported the successful United States Food and Drug Administration clearance of the CLN5 gene therapy product as an investigational new drug for the treatment of human CLN5 Batten disease. New Zealand Borderdale sheep with naturally occurring CLN5 NCL were used as they represent an ideal model in which to develop and test potential gene therapies for this largely pediatric condition. Nineteen CLN5<sup>−/−</sup> sheep received ICV scAAV9/oCLN5 therapy at three different ages representing different stages of disease development and over a 35-fold range of doses. A summary of the results is presented in <xref rid=""T1"" ref-type=""table"">Table 1</xref>. Theoretically the earlier gene therapy can be administered to patients with neuropathic lysosomal storage diseases, the more the clinical benefit. Three months of age is a pre-symptomatic disease stage in CLN5 affected sheep, modelling patients being symptom-free, with maximum functional neuronal cells present, and before cumulative pathogenic processes, including neuroinflammation and lysosomal storage body accumulation, become manifest. Given that a CLN5 diagnosis in humans can take years, the equivalent pre-symptomatic population in humans is normally restricted to younger siblings or close relatives of already diagnosed symptomatic CLN5 patients.

</sup> sheep have received pre-symptomatic ICV scAAV9/oCLN5 therapy at 3 months of age at two doses (8.0–8.2 × 10<sup>10</sup> to 2.4 × 10<sup>11</sup> vg). The treatment provided long-term therapeutic benefit. Clinical disease was considerably delayed and five of the treated animals survived to more than double the natural life expectancy of untreated CLN5<sup>−/−</sup> sheep. Longitudinal neuroimaging indicated a halt or slowing in the stereotypical brain atrophy of ovine CLN5 disease and four of these sheep maintained intracranial volumes in the range of healthy CLN5<sup>+/−</sup> controls before declining slowly over time. One pre-symptomatic treated sheep (1104–16) did not respond as positively to the moderate dose (2.4 × 10<sup>11</sup> vg) ICV treatment and was euthanized at 27.4 months of age with developing clinical disease. Despite its 7.0 mL loss in intracranial volume, this was at a slower rate than untreated CLN5<sup>−/−</sup> sheep and post-mortem analyses revealed a significant reduction in disease-associated neuropathology. The low level of CLN5 transduction efficiency in the brain of this animal is likely causative of the reduced therapeutic benefit compared with her similarly treated cohorts. One of the pre-symptomatically treated sheep (LD 1115–18) was euthanized on welfare grounds at 17.9 months of age due to suspected acute polioencephalomalacia (PEM). This neurological disease, also known as cerebrocortical necrosis, is seen worldwide in ruminants and presents sub-acutely with similar clinical signs to ovine Batten disease hence diagnosis was not detected. PEM is primarily associated with thiamine or dietary deficiencies (<xref rid=""B15"" ref-type=""bibr"">Lévy, 2020</xref>) but no cause was identified in this case and no other animals in the flock developed the condition. The brain of sheep LD 1115–18 lacked the definitive post-mortem tests for PEM, faint yellow discoloration and/or fluorescence of the grey matter under ultraviolet light, so diagnosis could not be confirmed. However, it occurred 15 months after treatment, thus there was no evidence to attribute this condition to the gene therapy vector, anaesthesia, surgical or administration procedure. These results in pre-symptomatic sheep correlate well with previous CLN5 gene therapy studies in the Borderdale sheep model. Both single-stranded AAV9 and lentiviral vectors expressing ovine <italic toggle=""yes"">CLN5</italic> have been shown to normalize intracranial volume and prevent disease onset and progression when delivered to CLN5<sup>−/−</sup> sheep at 3 months of age (<xref rid=""B19"" ref-type=""bibr"">Mitchell et al., 2018</xref>). This study showed that the current central nervous system (CNS) viral vector of choice, self-complementary AAV9, can also be added to the suite of therapeutic vector platforms for CLN5 disease. Most human cases of Batten disease only become diagnosed following the development of overt disease, represented by the six-month-old early symptomatic CLN5<sup>−/−</sup> cohort. At this age, affected sheep demonstrate mild movement dysfunction and early visual loss, and cortical atrophy and neurodegeneration is obvious. Seven CLN5<sup>−/−</sup> sheep received moderate (2.7 × 10<sup>11</sup> vg) or high dose (2.8 × 10<sup>12</sup> vg) ICV scAAV9/oCLN5 therapy between six and 7 months of age. The treatment slowed disease progression in most treated animals. Live weight largely normalized, quality of life was improved, and lifespan extended to more than double to triple the natural expectancy of CLN5<sup>−/−</sup> sheep. Three animals survived to be over 42 months of age, and a fourth (1164–15) until over 60 months when it died unexpectedly of other causes. Aside from loss of vision, these sheep showed only mild phenotypic changes long after ICV injection. In particular, sheep 1164–15 had only mild episodes of stereotypical behavior and ataxia at her untimely death and did not show manifest ataxia, localized seizure activity or require extensive nursing. Intracranial volumes at injection were equivalent to those of untreated CLN5<sup>−/−</sup> sheep, and losses observed over the duration of the study occurred much more slowly than they do in untreated CLN5<sup>−/−</sup> sheep. Amelioration of all disease-related neuropathological markers indicated long-term treatment efficacy, albeit not complete. The treated sheep with the least therapeutic efficacy (MD 1185–6) was the animal with the lowest number of transduced cells, whilst there were many CLN5-positive cells in the motor, visual and parieto-occipital cortices, hippocampus and cerebellum of the HD early symptomatic treated sheep who survived to 60.1 months of age, indicating some linkage between transduction efficiency and therapeutic efficacy. Most human CLN5 cases are of a variant late infantile onset form, presenting between 1.5 and 8 years of age (<xref rid=""B37"" ref-type=""bibr"">Xin et al., 2010</xref>; <xref rid=""B21"" ref-type=""bibr"">Mole and Williams, 2013</xref>; <xref rid=""B34"" ref-type=""bibr"">Simonati et al., 2017</xref>), then progressing to severe impairment in the learning/cognition, motor, language, vision, and seizures domains and premature death. The advanced symptomatic nine-month-old CLN5<sup>−/−</sup> cohort was studied to determine the effectiveness of a treatment at this stage. At this age, untreated CLN5<sup>−/−</sup> sheep demonstrate clear phenotypic deficits, particularly related to visual loss, and the affected brain has reduced to approximately 85% the weight of a healthy sheep brain (<xref rid=""B18"" ref-type=""bibr"">Mitchell et al., 2023</xref>). Neuronal loss is advanced, particularly from the occipital cortex where cortical thicknesses are reduced to half those of a healthy CLN5<sup>+/−</sup> sheep (<xref rid=""B18"" ref-type=""bibr"">Mitchell et al., 2023</xref>). Unfortunately, due to limited vector availability, advanced symptomatic sheep could only be treated with a MD treatment and not the HD which had proved most efficacious in the early symptomatic cohort. Nevertheless, of the three CLN5<sup>−/−</sup> sheep who received treatment at 9 months of age, one responded favorably (MD 1163–16). Disease progression was stabilized until 19 months post-treatment when the animal began to decline clinically, and it was euthanized at 30.9 months of age following increasing episodes of inducible tremors and stereotypical circling behavior. Intracranial volume loss was moderate, at 5.4 mL from 9 to 30.9 months, but significantly less than untreated CLN5<sup>−/−</sup> sheep that lost an average of 9.4 mL between 3 and 19 months of age. In-life assessments of efficacy suggest that another MD ICV treated advanced symptomatic sheep (1143–16) was a non-responder, whilst the treatment had only minimal positive benefit to the third sheep. These two animals had fewer transduced cells, but neuropathological analyses also revealed amelioration of common disease markers (cortical thinning, astrocytosis, microgliosis, storage body accumulation) to a degree. A number of gene therapy clinical trials have been performed, are underway, or are in preparation, for the different forms of NCL (<ext-link http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink href=""https://clinicaltrials.gov/"" ext-link-type=""uri"">https://clinicaltrials.gov/</ext-link>), including the first in-human CLN5 gene therapy study based on these and other efficacy studies in CLN5<sup>−/−</sup> sheep (<ext-link http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink href=""http://Clinicaltrials.gov"" ext-link-type=""uri"">Clinicaltrials.gov</ext-link> identifier: NCT05228145). Routes of administration have typically been intraparenchymal (CLN2) or intrathecal into the lumbar cistern (CLN3, CLN6, CLN7). Pilot studies in a small number of healthy sheep indicate that the ICV route resulted in the most robust widespread distribution of vector throughout the entire CNS, compared to intracisternal magna, lumbar intrathecal or intraparenchymal delivery. Delivery directly into the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) was preferred for CLN5 therapeutics, as it allows for maximum transduction of the CNS and circumvents the blood-brain and blood-CSF barriers, reducing the risk of an immune response or off-target side effects, seen with systemic (intravenous) delivery of AAV9 vectors and other biologics (<xref rid=""B38"" ref-type=""bibr"">Zincarelli et al., 2008</xref>; <xref rid=""B36"" ref-type=""bibr"">Xie et al., 2011</xref>; <xref rid=""B31"" ref-type=""bibr"">Sadekar et al., 2022</xref>). Increasingly the ICV delivery route is being recognized as a powerful way to transduce widespread areas of the brain in CNS disorders (<xref rid=""B10"" ref-type=""bibr"">Hughes et al., 2018</xref>; <xref rid=""B3"" ref-type=""bibr"">Bey et al., 2020</xref>; <xref rid=""B9"" ref-type=""bibr"">Hinderer et al., 2020</xref>; <xref rid=""B6"" ref-type=""bibr"">Galvan et al., 2021</xref>). It is the infusion route for the only current approved NCL enzyme replacement therapy, cerliponase alfa, for CLN2 disease (<xref rid=""B33"" ref-type=""bibr"">Schulz et al., 2018</xref>) and is the delivery route of choice to target the brain in the current CLN5 gene therapy clinical trial. Consistent with similar studies in non-human primates (<xref rid=""B24"" ref-type=""bibr"">Naidoo et al., 2018</xref>; <xref rid=""B3"" ref-type=""bibr"">Bey et al., 2020</xref>; <xref rid=""B6"" ref-type=""bibr"">Galvan et al., 2021</xref>), this sheep study shows that the ICV delivery route did not result in high levels of transduction of deeper brain structures, such as the basal ganglia (striatum, putamen and caudate nucleus) or thalamus. However, failure to greatly transduce these regions that are not as severely affected in ovine CLN5 disease (<xref rid=""B18"" ref-type=""bibr"">Mitchell et al., 2023</xref>) did not result in increased subcortical disease pathology and seems unlikely to have contributed greatly to disease progression. Levels of neuroinflammation and storage burden in the thalamus and cerebellum of ICV treated sheep aged 17.9–60.1 months of age were not significantly different from much younger 24-month-old untreated CLN5<sup>−/−</sup> sheep. In fact, the four early symptomatic treated sheep who received the highest ICV dose had significantly less thalamic gliosis and lysosomal storage accumulation in their thalamus and cerebellum than untreated CLN5<sup>−/−</sup> sheep, suggesting higher doses might even attenuate subcortical pathology. Much discussion arises over the benefits of unilateral <italic toggle=""yes"">versus</italic> bilateral ICV delivery route. Whilst bilateral injections have been used in most pre-clinical animal studies, therapeutic benefit has been demonstrated in a canine model of CLN2 NCL after a single unilateral injection of AAV serotype 2 expressing the canine CLN2/TPP1 enzyme (<xref rid=""B14"" ref-type=""bibr"">Katz et al., 2015</xref>). Injections in this study were bilateral except for one (HD 1172-15) that received both doses into the right ventricle following difficulty in identifying the left ventricle. This had no apparent impact on the efficacy of the treatment. The sheep was clinically stable, lost minimal intracranial volume and was euthanized early at 22.3 months of age, whilst in excellent clinical health. Post-mortem neuropathological analysis revealed no significant difference in cortical thickness, neuroinflammatory marker expression, lysosomal storage burden or CLN5 expression between the two hemispheres suggesting widespread CNS transduction could be achieved by unilateral delivery. The only asymmetry was a larger amount of transduced sensory and motor neurons in the right column of the cervical spinal cord compared with the left column. In line with previous NCL gene therapy studies in sheep and dogs (<xref rid=""B14"" ref-type=""bibr"">Katz et al., 2015</xref>; <xref rid=""B19"" ref-type=""bibr"">Mitchell et al., 2018</xref>). ICV delivery alone was not sufficient to protect against vision loss in the current study. Unilateral intravitreal (IVT) delivery of scAAV9/oCLN5 has resulted in maintenance of retinal structure and function in the treated eye of CLN5<sup>−/−</sup> sheep for up to 15 months post-treatment, while the untreated eye displayed progressive electroretinographic decline and severe atrophy on post-mortem examination (<xref rid=""B22"" ref-type=""bibr"">Murray et al., 2021</xref>). A second IND-enabling study in sheep has subsequently shown that combined ocular and brain-directed gene therapy simultaneously halt neurological and retinal disease in ovine CLN5 Batten disease (<xref rid=""B23"" ref-type=""bibr"">Murray et al., 2023</xref>), prompting clinical translation of dual ICV and IVT administration for this disease. Although the ICV delivery route is efficacious in the brain, one of the concerns with a non-systemic delivery route is that not all regions of the body are targeted. Typically, in NCL, pathology outside of the brain and eye have not been considered due to the profound effect of neurodegeneration, vision loss and death before other pathologies emerge. However, the <italic toggle=""yes"">CLN5</italic> gene mutation is present in every cell of the body, lysosomal storage is largely ubiquitous and in humans endogenous CLN5 protein is widely expressed (<ext-link http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink href=""https://www.proteinatlas.org/"" ext-link-type=""uri"">https://www.proteinatlas.org/</ext-link>). Extra-neuronal pathologies have previously been documented in the heart, liver and muscle tissue of CLN2<sup>−/−</sup> dogs whose lives were significantly extended through ICV CLN2 gene therapy (<xref rid=""B13"" ref-type=""bibr"">Katz et al., 2017</xref>). Here, the HD treated sheep 1,164–15 died unexpectedly at 60.1 months of age from gastrointestinal stasis. Descriptions of constipation, abdominal pain and bloating, vomiting, gastric reflux, changes in gut microbiota, loss of enteric neurons and impaired gastrointestinal motility have been published and anecdotally reported for NCL patients and animal models (<xref rid=""B20"" ref-type=""bibr"">Mole et al., 2021</xref>; <xref rid=""B28"" ref-type=""bibr"">Parker et al., 2021</xref>; <xref rid=""B35"" ref-type=""bibr"">Wang et al., 2021</xref>) so long-term future therapeutic strategies may be required for other pathologies, such as those in the enteric nervous system. There were other limitations to this study. Although histochemical analyses suggested the co-existence of vector-transduced cells and cross-corrected cells within the treated brain, it was not categorically possible to confirm that cross-correction was occurring in the ICV treated sheep brains. Strong CLN5-positive transduced cells were easily distinguished from diffuse weak CLN5-positive neighboring cells which were hypothesized to have taken up secreted CLN5 protein. However, as treated sheep brains were perfusion-fixed <italic toggle=""yes"">in situ</italic>, no fresh frozen brain tissue was available for vector copy number analyses for a direct comparison of CLN5 protein to AAV9 distribution. The <italic toggle=""yes"">CLN5</italic> mutation in Borderdale sheep is caused by a splice site nucleotide substitution, resulting in the excision of exon 3 and a truncated protein (<xref rid=""B5"" ref-type=""bibr"">Frugier et al., 2008</xref>). Like sheep, many of the disease-causing mutations in humans result in a putative shorter CLN5 protein (<xref rid=""B2"" ref-type=""bibr"">Basak et al., 2021</xref>), however some patients will have mutations that preclude any CLN5 protein synthesis. Therefore, there is a risk that CLN5<sup>−/−</sup> individuals, who lack expression of some or all natural CLN5 epitopes, could mount an immune response when they receive the <italic toggle=""yes"">CLN5</italic> transgene, however this does not appear to be an issue in sheep. Indeed, CNS and ocular gene therapy studies show that sheep appear to be tolerant to native and non-native transgenes (<xref rid=""B1"" ref-type=""bibr"">Banin et al., 2015</xref>; <xref rid=""B7"" ref-type=""bibr"">Gray-Edwards et al., 2018</xref>; <xref rid=""B26"" ref-type=""bibr"">O’Leary et al., 2023</xref>). In the current study, there was no apparent upregulation in neuroinflammation in treated sheep that could not be considered disease-associated, and there was long-term transgene expression and no other clinical indications of toxicity. However, as the sheep did not receive any immunosuppressive drugs, this study did not provide translational data on the need for immunomodulation in human CLN5 patients. Finally, the ovine and human <italic toggle=""yes"">CLN5</italic> transgenes used in this study were codon optimized. There is concern that this is not necessary for expression of a gene in its native host and the process itself might affect protein conformation and function, detrimentally increasing immunogenicity or reducing efficacy (<xref rid=""B17"" ref-type=""bibr"">Mauro and Chappell, 2014</xref>). Here, codon optimization was performed to strengthen the expression cassette, ensure robust protein expression, and minimize the potential for cryptic splice sites and start codons which might produce non-specific or immunogenic peptides. Whilst the native sequence is preferred, it was evident from this study that codon optimization did not adversely affect functionality and the first-in-human CLN5 gene therapy Phase I/II Clinical Trial (NCT05228145) supported by these sheep studies will also use a codon-optimised human <italic toggle=""yes"">CLN5</italic> transgene. Overall, these studies in CLN5<sup>−/−</sup> sheep demonstrate the long-term efficacy of ICV scAAV9/oCLN5 gene therapy when delivered at pre-symptomatic, early symptomatic, and more advanced symptomatic disease stages at the doses administered. Treatment was well tolerated, delayed disease progression, stereotypical brain atrophy, and disease pathology in the majority of the treated sheep but did not preserve vision at any dose or disease state evaluated. In preparation for clinical translation, <italic toggle=""yes"">in vitro</italic> studies indicated higher expression levels of the proposed investigational drug, AAV9 expressing the human <italic toggle=""yes"">CLN5</italic> gene, than the ovine gene therapy product delivered <italic toggle=""yes"">in vivo</italic>. Typically for lysosomal storage diseases like CLN5 NCL, the earlier the treatment the better (<xref rid=""B32"" ref-type=""bibr"">Sands and Davidson, 2006</xref>), yet the findings from early and advanced symptomatic treated sheep demonstrate dose-dependent transduction efficiency is important. Here, the MD and HD treatments were the most efficacious, prompting further studies in sheep with even higher doses and the inclusion of an ocular delivery route for retinal targeting (<xref rid=""B23"" ref-type=""bibr"">Murray et al., 2023</xref>). This study indicates great translational promise for extending and improving the quality of life in post-symptomatic CLN5 patients, so long as they have sufficient remaining cortical and cerebellar neurons to benefit from CLN5 expression and that higher doses are likely to be more effective.",N/A,08 8 2023
A novel porcine model of CLN3 Batten disease recapitulates clinical phenotypes,"Mouse models of CLN3 Batten disease, a rare lysosomal storage disorder with no cure, have improved our understanding of CLN3 biology and therapeutics through their ease of use and a consistent display of cellular pathology. However, the translatability of murine models is limited by disparities in anatomy, body size, life span and inconsistent subtle behavior deficits that can be difficult to detect in CLN3 mutant mouse models, thereby limiting their use in preclinical studies. Here, we present a longitudinal characterization of a novel miniswine model of CLN3 disease that recapitulates the most common human pathogenic variant, an exon 7-8 deletion (<italic toggle=""yes"">CLN3<sup>Δex7/8</sup></italic>). Progressive pathology and neuron loss is observed in various regions of the <italic toggle=""yes"">CLN3<sup>Δex7/8</sup></italic> miniswine brain and retina. Additionally, mutant miniswine present with retinal degeneration and motor abnormalities, similar to deficits seen in humans diagnosed with the disease.

Transgenic swine provide a powerful translational tool for modeling human diseases that are poorly recapitulated in smaller animal models (<xref rid=""DMM050038C81"" ref-type=""bibr"">Rogers et al., 2008b</xref>; <xref rid=""DMM050038C86"" ref-type=""bibr"">Sieren et al., 2014</xref>; <xref rid=""DMM050038C50"" ref-type=""bibr"">Khanna et al., 2019</xref>; <xref rid=""DMM050038C101"" ref-type=""bibr"">White et al., 2018</xref>; <xref rid=""DMM050038C5"" ref-type=""bibr"">Beraldi et al., 2015</xref>; <xref rid=""DMM050038C21"" ref-type=""bibr"">Davis et al., 2014</xref>; <xref rid=""DMM050038C74"" ref-type=""bibr"">Park et al., 2015</xref>), with their use as a model organism gaining popularity over the past 30 years (<xref rid=""DMM050038C32"" ref-type=""bibr"">Gutierrez et al., 2015</xref>). More recently, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved a domesticated pig line as the first use of a genetically engineered animal for both food and biomedical/therapeutic purposes (<uri http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink href=""https://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/fda-approves-first-its-kind-intentional-genomic-alteration-line-domestic-pigs-both-human-food"">https://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/fda-approves-first-its-kind-intentional-genomic-alteration-line-domestic-pigs-both-human-food</uri>). Additionally, swine models are especially useful in neurodegenerative disease modeling due to their gyrencephalic brains, and useful in therapeutic screening as their brains are similar in size to those of humans and, thus, possess a more human-like physiology and pharmacokinetics. In general, large animal models for Batten disease, such as the CLN1 (<xref rid=""DMM050038C23"" ref-type=""bibr"">Eaton et al., 2019</xref>), CLN5 (<xref rid=""DMM050038C30"" ref-type=""bibr"">Frugier et al., 2008</xref>) and CLN6 (<xref rid=""DMM050038C41"" ref-type=""bibr"">Jolly et al., 1980</xref>; <xref rid=""DMM050038C7"" ref-type=""bibr"">Bond et al., 2013</xref>) sheep models, as well as the CLN2 dog (<xref rid=""DMM050038C46"" ref-type=""bibr"">Katz et al., 2008a</xref>, <xref rid=""DMM050038C48"" ref-type=""bibr"">2014</xref>, <xref rid=""DMM050038C49"" ref-type=""bibr"">2015</xref>, <xref rid=""DMM050038C45"" ref-type=""bibr"">2005</xref>) and CLN2 pig models (<xref rid=""DMM050038C89"" ref-type=""bibr"">Swier et al., 2022</xref>), show more clinically relevant symptoms of the disease. Moreover, lifespan of these model animals is longer, allowing the long-term evaluation of disease course, and the effectiveness and safety of therapeutics (<xref rid=""DMM050038C28"" ref-type=""bibr"">Ellinwood and Clay, 2009</xref>). Given these advantages, our team developed a novel porcine model of CLN3 disease that replicates the histopathological, behavioral and visual abnormalities experienced by patients with CLN3 Batten disease.  The <italic toggle=""yes"">CLN3<sup>Δex7/8</sup></italic> miniswine model recapitulates many human phenotypes of CLN3 disease, including consistent retinal degeneration and gait abnormalities, as well as classic Batten disease pathologies, such as storage material accumulation, glial activation, photoreceptor loss, and calbindin interneuron loss in the somatosensory cortex and motor cortex. Importantly, when compared to <italic toggle=""yes"">Cln3<sup>Δex7/8</sup></italic> mouse models, the <italic toggle=""yes"">CLN3<sup>Δex7/8</sup></italic> miniswine model shows a more-severe and consistent phenotype of retinal cell loss and gait abnormalities. In patients with CLN3 disease, vision loss is one of the first diagnosed symptoms, with the onset of visual failure occurring at a mean age of 6.4 years, with the mean age of diagnosis being 8.4 years of age (<xref rid=""DMM050038C18"" ref-type=""bibr"">Collins et al., 2006</xref>; <xref rid=""DMM050038C57"" ref-type=""bibr"">Kuper et al., 2021</xref>). In the <italic toggle=""yes"">CLN3<sup>Δex7/8</sup></italic> miniswine, reduced ERG amplitudes and delayed latencies were first observed at 30 months of age, which – when scaled proportionally to the 15-year lifespan of the Yucatan miniswine model – equates to approximately the age of an older adolescent child. The range of onset does vary in CLN3 patients; males with an earlier onset have been diagnosed with the disease as late as 11.5 years (<xref rid=""DMM050038C18"" ref-type=""bibr"">Collins et al., 2006</xref>). However, other studies have found a later (on average) onset of 29.7 years in males and females (<xref rid=""DMM050038C55"" ref-type=""bibr"">Ku et al., 2017</xref>), which is reflective of the variability in the visual phenotype. In patients, ophthalmic examination may detect retinopathy, maculopathy, loss of retinal function as indicated by preferential loss of the dark-adapted ERG (scotopic) b-wave amplitude, reduction of scotopic a-waves amplitude and, eventually, reduction of light-adapted ERG (photopic) a- and b-wave amplitudes with a delay in b-wave responses as the disease progresses (<xref rid=""DMM050038C35"" ref-type=""bibr"">Horiguchi and Miyake, 1992</xref>; <xref rid=""DMM050038C57"" ref-type=""bibr"">Kuper et al., 2021</xref>; <xref rid=""DMM050038C100"" ref-type=""bibr"">Weleber, 1998</xref>; <xref rid=""DMM050038C26"" ref-type=""bibr"">Eksandh et al., 2000</xref>). We see similar trends in the <italic toggle=""yes"">CLN3<sup>Δex7/8</sup></italic> miniswine, with a significant decrease in scotopic b-wave amplitude present before any reductions in scotopic a-waves, and an earlier reduction in photopic a- and b-waves that progressively declines at later stages of the disease. In contrast, <italic toggle=""yes"">Cln3<sup>Δex7/8</sup></italic> mice models show b-wave declines at a much later stage of the disease that is akin to end-stage patients (<xref rid=""DMM050038C94"" ref-type=""bibr"">Volz et al., 2014</xref>; <xref rid=""DMM050038C52"" ref-type=""bibr"">Kleine Holthaus et al., 2020</xref>). Of note, at 48 months, we do see completely extinguished a- and b- waveforms in the light-adapted cone responses, and dark-adapted mixed rod and cone responses in both the left and right eye of <italic toggle=""yes"">CLN3<sup>Δex7/8</sup></italic> males. Extinguished photopic and scotopic responses might not necessarily be indicative of complete blindness but, combined with the anatomic photoreceptor loss, strongly suggests that these male pigs are extremely visually impaired. Similarly, optical coherence tomography (OCT) imaging in patients with an undetectable ERG response shows loss of photoreceptors, and marked atrophy of inner and outer nuclear layers of the retina (<xref rid=""DMM050038C104"" ref-type=""bibr"">Wright et al., 2020</xref>; <xref rid=""DMM050038C79"" ref-type=""bibr"">Preising et al., 2017</xref>). Our <italic toggle=""yes"">CLN3<sup>Δex7/8</sup></italic> miniswine model also exhibited thinning and cell loss in the outer nuclear layer, and complete loss of photoreceptors in the oldest animals monitored (<xref rid=""DMM050038F4"" ref-type=""fig"">Fig. 4</xref>). In contrast, aged <italic toggle=""yes"">Cln3<sup>Δex7/8</sup></italic> mouse models have shown only a loss of bipolar cells without retinal atrophy in the outer nuclear layer (<xref rid=""DMM050038C52"" ref-type=""bibr"">Kleine Holthaus et al., 2020</xref>). Differences in photoreceptor localization between species might explain the phenotypic differences between <italic toggle=""yes"">CLN3<sup>Δex7/8</sup></italic> miniswine and <italic toggle=""yes"">Cln3<sup>Δex7/8</sup></italic> mice, as mice lack a macula region of concentrated photoreceptors, whereas swine have a macula-like region similar to that in humans (<xref rid=""DMM050038C85"" ref-type=""bibr"">Shrader and Greentree, 2018</xref>). We also investigated whether <italic toggle=""yes"">CLN3<sup>Δex7/8</sup></italic> miniswine display gait abnormalities as a correlate with the loss of motor function, impaired balance or shuffling-gait phenotypes that are common in patients with CLN3 (<xref rid=""DMM050038C108"" ref-type=""bibr"">Zimmerman et al., 2020</xref>). <italic toggle=""yes"">CLN3<sup>Δex7/8</sup></italic> male miniswine presented a more-cautious gait with smaller footfalls and a controlled stance with lower COP distance values. COP measurements in gait analysis explain how much an individual moves the directional placement of a COP footfall without losing balance, and greater COP distance values indicate a lack of precise controlled movements (<xref rid=""DMM050038C60"" ref-type=""bibr"">Lemay et al., 2014</xref>). Therefore, lower COP values might be indicative of a careful balancing strategy to compensate for lack of stability. Importantly, reduced variability in COP has been recorded in patients with neurological gait disorders and in patients recovering from stroke as an adaptation to avoid falls, and stabilize the gait (<xref rid=""DMM050038C10"" ref-type=""bibr"">Bower et al., 2019</xref>; <xref rid=""DMM050038C25"" ref-type=""bibr"">Ehrhardt et al., 2020</xref>). Whereas <italic toggle=""yes"">Cln3<sup>Δex7/8</sup></italic> mouse models present with mild motor-coordination phenotypes that are difficult to recapitulate across laboratories, differences in <italic toggle=""yes"">CLN3<sup>Δex7/8</sup></italic> miniswine gait were consistent across the time points studied. These differences were primarily male driven, echoing previous reports of sex-specific presentations and disease course in patients and mouse models (<xref rid=""DMM050038C53"" ref-type=""bibr"">Kovacs and Pearce, 2015</xref>; <xref rid=""DMM050038C17"" ref-type=""bibr"">Cialone et al., 2012</xref>). Interestingly, male <italic toggle=""yes"">CLN3<sup>Δex7/8</sup></italic> miniswine had consistently smaller footfalls across the entire time period studied and – as there were no weight differences between genotypes in the male animals – smaller footfall is unlikely to be a result of body size differences. A possible explanation for small footfalls in <italic toggle=""yes"">CLN3<sup>Δex7/8</sup></italic> miniswine could be the presence of osteoarthritis, which has been documented in patients with other lysosomal storage disorders, such as mucopolysaccharidoses (<xref rid=""DMM050038C8"" ref-type=""bibr"">Borgo et al., 2018</xref>; <xref rid=""DMM050038C92"" ref-type=""bibr"">Tomatsu et al., 2015</xref>), and presents in swine as a convex curvature of the knee that causes the principal digits of the foot to lift off of the ground (<xref rid=""DMM050038C42"" ref-type=""bibr"">Jørgensen, 2000</xref>). This could result in smaller footfalls on a pressure-sensor mat, and more research is needed to understand the nuances of gait abnormalities in swine models of disease. As observed in patients and <italic toggle=""yes"">Cln3<sup>Δex7/8</sup></italic> mouse models, one of the most-common markers of Batten disease, i.e. mitochondrial ATP SubC, was found to accumulate throughout multiple brain regions in <italic toggle=""yes"">CLN3<sup>Δex7/8</sup></italic> miniswine. However, unlike in patient and <italic toggle=""yes"">Cln3<sup>Δex7/8</sup></italic> mouse models (<xref rid=""DMM050038C20"" ref-type=""bibr"">Cotman et al., 2002</xref>; <xref rid=""DMM050038C77"" ref-type=""bibr"">Pontikis et al., 2005</xref>), astrocytosis was only detected in the VPM/VPL nuclei of the thalamus and not in any examined cortical region of <italic toggle=""yes"">CLN3<sup>Δex7/8</sup></italic> miniswine. One reason could be linked to the increased level of GFAP expression in white matter fibrous astrocytes compared to lower GFAP expression in gray matter protoplasmic astrocytes that has been documented in aging brains (<xref rid=""DMM050038C63"" ref-type=""bibr"">Lundgaard et al., 2014</xref>). The latter might indicate the differential upregulation of inflammatory factors in activated white matter astrocytes that are not upregulated in gray matter astrocytes (<xref rid=""DMM050038C31"" ref-type=""bibr"">Guillot et al., 2015</xref>). In other miniswine models of neurodegeneration GFAP-positive astrocytes have also not been detected within cortical gray matter (<xref rid=""DMM050038C4"" ref-type=""bibr"">Ardan et al., 2019</xref>), possibly indicating an even greater differential regulation of GFAP expression in the protoplasmic astrocytes of swine (<xref rid=""DMM050038C4"" ref-type=""bibr"">Ardan et al., 2019</xref>). Additionally, gene expression studies in astrocytes have found species-specific differences between humans and mice, increasing the likelihood that miniswine also have species-specific astrocyte expression profiles that are, perhaps, not represented through astrocyte labeling as commonly used in research of Batten disease (<xref rid=""DMM050038C62"" ref-type=""bibr"">Li et al., 2021</xref>). Although activated astrocytes were not present in the cortex, we did find activated microglia with enlarged somas in the somatosensory and motor cortices in <italic toggle=""yes"">CLN3<sup>Δex7/8</sup></italic> miniswine. Activated microglia have been identified in <italic toggle=""yes"">Cln3</italic> mouse models in multiple cortical regions (<xref rid=""DMM050038C76"" ref-type=""bibr"">Pontikis et al., 2004</xref>) and microglia isolated from <italic toggle=""yes"">Cln3<sup>Δex7/8</sup></italic> mice have been shown to be primed for activation (<xref rid=""DMM050038C106"" ref-type=""bibr"">Xiong and Kielian, 2013</xref>). Interestingly, two different populations of microglia have been isolated from <italic toggle=""yes"">Cln3<sup>Δex7/8</sup></italic> mice – one showing autofluorescence and increased levels of LAMP1, and one not showing autofluorescence or increased levels of LAMP1– indicating lysosomal disfunction in microglia with autofluorescence (<xref rid=""DMM050038C13"" ref-type=""bibr"">Burns et al., 2020</xref>). Autofluorescent microglia also show increased rates of cell death (<xref rid=""DMM050038C13"" ref-type=""bibr"">Burns et al., 2020</xref>), indicating that accumulated autofluorescence functionally impacts microglia by reducing the ability to remove debris, thus contributing to the pathology of <italic toggle=""yes"">CLN3</italic> disease. Accumulation of mitochondrial ATP SubC (indicative of autofluorescence accumulation) in the cortices of the <italic toggle=""yes"">CLN3<sup>Δex7/8</sup></italic> miniswine might explain the enlarged somas, as the microglia are changing to the amoeboid phagocytizing state to remove excess autofluorescent material. Although swine models are touted to be more translatable to conditions of Batten disease in humans, species differences still exist. For example, swine do not present with ulceration of the gastrointestinal tract in stress induced environments and, although the connective tissue of liver in swine is anatomically similar to that in humans, swine do not have the same susceptibility to injury-induced cirrhosis of the liver (<xref rid=""DMM050038C90"" ref-type=""bibr"">Swindle et al., 2012</xref>). Additionally, the use of swine and other large animal models of disease are complicated by the lack of species-specific tools, such as antibodies, protocols, behavior equipment and tissue atlases. Regarding central nervous system-specific disease modeling, brain collection is challenging owing to the thicker and denser skull in swine, MRI atlases are not readily available for imaging studies and neurocognitive tests may be difficult to perform or interpret. While there are several caveats and while improvements need to be made in the use of large animal models of disease, the <italic toggle=""yes"">CLN3<sup>Δex7/8</sup></italic> miniswine model is a marked improvement over the traditional <italic toggle=""yes"">Cln3<sup>Δex7/8</sup></italic> mouse model. Miniswine are similar in size, anatomy, and physiology to the human condition, and the <italic toggle=""yes"">CLN3<sup>Δex7/8</sup></italic> miniswine model presents with robust visual and gait impairments that are typically absent from CLN3 mouse models. <italic toggle=""yes"">CLN3<sup>Δex7/8</sup></italic> miniswine, therefore, hold the promise of improving our understanding of CLN3 disease mechanisms and provide a more-relevant setting in which to test therapeutic interventions.

Loss of the batten disease protein CLN3 leads to mis-trafficking of M6PR and defective autophagic-lysosomal reformation,"Batten disease, one of the most devastating types of neurodegenerative lysosomal storage disorders, is caused by mutations in <italic toggle=""yes"">CLN3</italic>. Here, we show that CLN3 is a vesicular trafficking hub connecting the Golgi and lysosome compartments. Proteomic analysis reveals that CLN3 interacts with several endo-lysosomal trafficking proteins, including the cation-independent mannose 6 phosphate receptor (CI-M6PR), which coordinates the targeting of lysosomal enzymes to lysosomes. CLN3 depletion results in mis-trafficking of CI-M6PR, mis-sorting of lysosomal enzymes, and defective autophagic lysosomal reformation. Conversely, CLN3 overexpression promotes the formation of multiple lysosomal tubules, which are autophagy and CI-M6PR-dependent, generating newly formed proto-lysosomes. Together, our findings reveal that CLN3 functions as a link between the M6P-dependent trafficking of lysosomal enzymes and lysosomal reformation pathway, explaining the global impairment of lysosomal function in Batten disease. CLN3 mutations cause Batten disease, a devastating neurodegenerative lysosomal storage disease. Here, the authors discovered that CLN3 plays a crucial role in both trafficking of lysosomal proteins and autophagic lysosomal reformation.","Neuronal Ceroid Lipofuscinoses (NCLs) are neurodegenerative lysosomal storage disorders (LSDs) associated with the accumulation of auto-fluorescent ceroid material (lipofuscins) inside lysosomes<sup><xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR1"">1</xref></sup>. NCLs are caused by mutations in genes encoding either transmembrane (e.g., CLN3, CLN7) or soluble (e.g., CLN1, CLN2, CLN5) lysosomal proteins, as well as non-lysosomal proteins (CLN6, CLN8)<sup><xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR2"">2</xref>–<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR4"">4</xref></sup>. Unfortunately, the biochemical function and physiological role of most CLN proteins remains elusive. This also applies to CLN3, whose mutations underlie a severe form of NCL, known as Batten disease (NCL3)<sup><xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR5"">5</xref></sup>. CLN3 is a predicted multi-pass transmembrane protein that was reported to be localized predominantly at the lysosome<sup><xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR6"">6</xref></sup>. Similarly to other NCLs, NCL3 disease is associated with ceroid lipofuscin accumulation primarily in the brain<sup><xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR5"">5</xref></sup>, with devastating disease manifestations spanning from blindness, seizures, and dementia, to the progressive loss of cognitive and motor skills, ultimately leading to death. These symptoms typically arise at ~4–7 years of age, and cause death by age 30<sup><xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR2"">2</xref>,<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR7"">7</xref>,<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR8"">8</xref></sup>. Most patients with NCL3 carry a homozygous 1.02 Kb deletion in the CLN3 gene, whereas some are compound heterozygotes, carrying this deletion in combination with other mutations<sup><xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR9"">9</xref>–<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR12"">12</xref></sup>. Currently approved therapies for NCL3 only manage symptoms, whereas effective therapeutic approaches are unavailable, mostly due to the lack of knowledge on the biological function of CLN3. Lysosomal enzymes after being synthesized in the endoplasmic reticulum, they traffic through the Golgi where they acquire M6P residues, and then are targeted to the endo-lysosomes through the recognition of M6P residues by mannose-6-phosphate receptors (M6PRs)<sup><xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR13"">13</xref></sup>. We discovered that CLN3 regulates the trafficking of CI-M6PR, thus playing a central role in the targeting of lysosomal enzymes to the lysosome. We also discovered that CLN3 is involved in Autophagic Lysosomal Reformation (ALR), an essential process to generate new functioning proto-lysosomes from mature lysosomes<sup><xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR14"">14</xref></sup>. This process is promoted by prolonged starvation, a condition that activates autophagy. Upon autophagosome-lysosome fusion, cargo degradation results in the release of nutrients that are then required for mTOR reactivation. This triggers a membrane remodeling mechanism characterized by the generation of PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> subdomains, and the assembly of AP2-clathrin lattices, where the anchoring of kinesin-1 determines the generation of tubules and of novel proto-lysosomes<sup><xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR15"">15</xref>,<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR16"">16</xref></sup>. Mutations in genes important for lysosomal function, have already been associated with ALR. For example, mutations in spinster, a critical regulator of ALR<sup><xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR17"">17</xref></sup>, result in alteration of lysosomal pH, defective lysosomal degradative function, and faulty ALR due to failure of mTOR reactivation<sup><xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR17"">17</xref></sup>. Also, in flies, spinster mutations recapitulate several features of LSDs<sup><xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR18"">18</xref></sup>. Notably, failure of ALR was also shown in some LSDs such as Scheie syndrome, Fabry disease, and Aspartylglucosaminuria<sup><xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR15"">15</xref></sup>. Here we show that CLN3 localizes both at the Golgi apparatus and at the lysosome, where it interacts with multiple trafficking protein complexes to mediate recycling of CI-M6PR at the Golgi. Loss-of-function of CLN3 causes degradation of CI-M6PR in lysosomes, mis-targeting and secretion of lysosomal enzymes, and impairment of autophagic-lysosomal reformation.  Batten disease, caused by mutations in <italic toggle=""yes"">CLN3</italic>, is one of the most devastating neurodegenerative childhood diseases. Its progressive nature and fatal outcome represent a heavy burden for the families of affected children and for society. CLN3 has been linked to a variety of different processes, such as regulation of lysosomal pH<sup><xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR32"">32</xref>,<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR33"">33</xref></sup>, autophagy<sup><xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR34"">34</xref>,<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR35"">35</xref></sup>, calcium homeostasis<sup><xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR36"">36</xref>,<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR37"">37</xref></sup>, cell proliferation<sup><xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR38"">38</xref>,<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR39"">39</xref></sup> and synaptic activity<sup><xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR12"">12</xref></sup>, and it was recently shown to be essential for the clearance of glycerophosphodiesters from lysosomes<sup><xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR40"">40</xref></sup>. More recently, attention has shifted to the ability of CLN3 to modulate endocytic pathways and membrane dynamics<sup><xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR41"">41</xref>–<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR43"">43</xref></sup>, suggesting that this protein may exert a global role on lysosomal function. Interestingly, Schmidtke et al.<sup><xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR43"">43</xref></sup> recently described a general loss of lysosomal enzymes and defective trafficking of Tf and TfR in a cerebellar murine NCL3 cell line, while Yasa et al.<sup><xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR42"">42</xref></sup> reported a role for CLN3 in regulating retromer-RAB7A function. These results suggest a role of CLN3 in the regulation of endo-lysosomal trafficking and sorting of lysosomal enzymes. Thanks to the generation of a novel CLN3 antibody we were able to observe that CLN3 localization is not limited to lysosomes, as previously indicated, but a significant fraction of CLN3 is also found at the Golgi apparatus. More specifically, we observed a Golgi-specific 45 kDa form, which represents the newly synthesized protein, and a mature, highly glycosylated, 65–80 kDa form located both at the Golgi and lysosomes. We also observed that CLN3 Golgi localization, which was visible at early times of induction, was significantly reduced upon inhibition of protein biosynthesis (CHX treatment). These results strongly suggest that CLN3 is not a Golgi resident protein, but that the newly synthesized protein transits through the Golgi to reach the lysosomes. Moreover, proteomic analyses showed that CLN3 interacts with several endo-lysosomal trafficking complexes, such as BORC, BLOC1, retromer and ESCPE-1, as well as with SNAREs (e.g., VAMP3, VAMP7) proteins, clathrin adaptors, PI4K2A, a regulator of phosphoinositide metabolism, and CI-M6PR, an important sorting receptor of lysosomal hydrolases<sup><xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR13"">13</xref>,<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR44"">44</xref></sup>. Notably, CI-M6PR was among the most enriched CLN3 interactors. Most of lysosomal enzymes acquire mannose-6-phosphate residues, which are then recognized by specific sorting receptors (mannose-6-phosphate receptors, MPRs) and sorted into the endo-lysosomal compartment<sup><xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR13"">13</xref>,<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR44"">44</xref>,<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR45"">45</xref></sup>. We found that loss of CLN3 resulted in mis-sorting of CI-M6PR to the lysosomes, with its consequent degradation. Considering the role CI-M6PR, we postulated that CLN3 depletion would result in a global depletion of lysosomal hydrolases in the lysosomal lumen. In line with this hypothesis, proteomic analysis performed on purified lysosomes revealed a significant reduction of intra-lysosomal levels of several hydrolases. Schmidtke et al.<sup><xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR43"">43</xref></sup>, and by Metcalf et al.<sup><xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR46"">46</xref></sup> also reported defects in the trafficking of lysosomal enzymes in CLN3 KO cells. These data are consistent with an impaired sorting of lysosomal enzymes due to defective recycling of CI-M6PR. We also observed that GAA protein levels and enzymatic activity were reduced in CLN3 KO cells, and increased in the media, together with other lysosomal enzymes such as HexA. Notably, a similar mechanism was reported in two other neurodegenerative LSDs caused by mutations affecting the MPR-sorting pathway: mucolipidosis II or Inclusion-cell (I-cell) disease, and mucolipidosis III (pseudo-Hurler polydystrophy Inclusion-cell)<sup><xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR47"">47</xref></sup>. In these conditions, lysosomal enzymes cannot enter the lysosomal delivery route, instead they are secreted extracellularly, similarly to what we observed in CLN3 KO cells. Similar results were also reported by Pechincha et al.<sup><xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR48"">48</xref></sup>, who recently showed that depletion of LYSET, a core component of the M6P pathway, caused depletion of several lysosomal enzymes from the lysosomes, together with their consequent secretion in the media. Notably, all 14 enzymes that we found to be reduced in CLN3-KO lysosomes, were also reduced in lysosomes isolated from LYSET-depleted cells, confirming that our results are in line with a defect in the M6P pathway (Table <xref rid=""Tab1"" ref-type=""table"">1</xref>).<table-wrap id=""Tab1""><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>List of lysosomal enzymes significantly reduced in both lysosomes of CLN3- and LYSET-KO cells<sup><xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR48"">48</xref></sup></p></caption><table frame=""hsides"" rules=""groups""><thead><tr><th colspan=""3"">Luminal lysosomal enzymes</th></tr><tr><th>Reduced in CLN3-KO & LYSET-KO</th><th>Log2 Difference (CLN3-KO/CTRL)</th><th>Log2 Difference (LYSET-KO/CTRL)</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>CTSH</td><td>−4.58066</td><td>−2.88505</td></tr><tr><td>DPP7</td><td>−3.37081</td><td>−4.88403</td></tr><tr><td>HEXA</td><td>−3.19612</td><td>−4.70883</td></tr><tr><td>PRCP</td><td>−3.12789</td><td>−2.64847</td></tr><tr><td>ARSA</td><td>−2.72279</td><td>−4.38194</td></tr><tr><td>PPT1</td><td>−2.60860</td><td>−2.49936</td></tr><tr><td>PLBD2</td><td>−2.47825</td><td>−5.46654</td></tr><tr><td>GAA</td><td>−2.46810</td><td>−0.64867</td></tr><tr><td>GNS</td><td>−2.36429</td><td>−3.49467</td></tr><tr><td>CTSZ</td><td>−2.12500</td><td>−4.80665</td></tr><tr><td>AGA</td><td>−2.12223</td><td>−2.57942</td></tr><tr><td>GUSB</td><td>−2.02897</td><td>−3.42793</td></tr><tr><td>CTSA</td><td>−1.72551</td><td>−3.76310</td></tr><tr><td>GLB1</td><td>−1.54273</td><td>−4.99637</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><p>List of lysosomal enzymes significantly reduced in both lysosomes from CLN3- and LYSET-KO cells.

We reasoned that depletion of CI-M6PR and of lysosomal enzymes, may affect lysosomal function. In the absence of CLN3, electron microscopy revealed that cells accumulated enlarged and aggregated lysosomes, which is a feature of impaired ALR. Also, cells were unable to reactivate mTOR activity upon prolonged starvation and showed accumulation of enlarged LC3-GFP<sup>+</sup> autolysosomes 16 h post serum+glutamine starvation. Both of these features resemble defects observed during failure of ALR<sup><xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR15"">15</xref>–<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR17"">17</xref></sup>. Consistently, we found that tubules were almost completely absent in CLN3 KO cells, in both fed and prolonged starvation conditions. Rong et al.<sup><xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR17"">17</xref></sup> previously showed that during prolonged starvation a portion of lysosomes is initially consumed until they are restored by ALR upon starvation-induced autophagy. We quantified the number of lysosomes during starvation and observed that in CLN3-KO cells it remained stable over time, unlike in WT cells. These data suggest that loss of CLN3 impairs both lysosomal consumption during the initial phase of starvation and lysosomal reformation during prolonged starvation. Oppositely from CLN3 depletion, we observed that CLN3 overexpression positively modulates ALR. CLN3 overexpression resulted in tubule formation and in a substantial increase in the number of lysosomes, especially upon prolonged starvation, and a reduction of lysosomal size. Specifically, the number of lysosomes was significantly decreased after 8 h of starvation and recovered after 16 h to levels that are significantly higher compared to WT cells. We also determined that inhibition of autophagy through ATG7 silencing completely abolished CLN3-dependent tubules, confirming that this process is autophagy-dependent. Interestingly, newly formed proto-lysosomes contained lysosomal enzymes, as shown by lysoIP data, and tubules were positive for rhGAA, or pepstatinA, supporting the hypothesis that CLN3 may modulate ALR by promoting the delivery of lysosomal enzymes. Consistently, we observed that CI-M6PR is essential for CLN3-mediated ALR, as its silencing completely abolished lysosomal tubulation and reformation. Other interactors identified in our proteomic analysis may also play a role in the lysosomal reformation process. Both Lyspersin, a BORC subunit essential for lysosomal positioning and motility<sup><xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR49"">49</xref></sup>, and PI4K2A, a member of the family of phosphatidylinositol (PtdIns) 4-kinases responsible for phosphatidylinositol 4-monophosphate (PI4P) production<sup><xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR50"">50</xref>,<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR51"">51</xref></sup>, were also highly enriched among CLN3 interactors. The BORC subunit BLOC1S1 was recently shown to be important in the initiation of the lysosomal tubulation process<sup><xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR52"">52</xref></sup>. Also, mutations of Borcs7, a subunit of the BORC complex, result in a neurodegenerative phenotype associated with progressive axonal dystrophy and perinatal death in mice<sup><xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR53"">53</xref></sup>. Furthermore, PI4K2A was shown to play a role in ALR in hereditary spastic paraplegia (HSP), a group of neurodegenerative diseases associated with severe motor decline<sup><xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR54"">54</xref>,<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR55"">55</xref></sup>. The specific role of the interaction of CLN3 with Lyspersin and PI4K2A will be the subject of future studies. Notably, a recent study showed that loss of function of CLN7, another lysosomal transmembrane protein involved in NCL, resulted in both depletion of multiple soluble lysosomal proteins and impaired lysosome reformation<sup><xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR56"">56</xref></sup>. Also in this case, the impaired degradative capacity of lysosomes abolished mTOR reactivation and ALR. These findings indicate that ALR impairment and global alteration of the lysosomal degradative capacity may be a pathogenic mechanism common to other NCLs and suggest that CLN3 and CLN7 have similar roles in intracellular trafficking. In summary, we discovered that CLN3 plays a crucial role in the sorting of CI-M6PR and links this process with ALR, thus explaining the global lysosomal dysfunction observed in Batten disease (Fig. <xref rid=""Fig8"" ref-type=""fig"">8d</xref>). Hopefully, future studies based on these data will point to new therapeutic strategies for this devastating disease.  ",N/A,3 7 2023
Protracted CLN3 Batten disease in mice that genetically model an exon-skipping therapeutic approach,"Genetic mutations that disrupt open reading frames and cause translation termination are frequent causes of human disease and are difficult to treat due to protein truncation and mRNA degradation by nonsense-mediated decay, leaving few options for traditional drug targeting. Splice-switching antisense oligonucleotides offer a potential therapeutic solution for diseases caused by disrupted open reading frames by inducing exon skipping to correct the open reading frame. We have recently reported on an exon-skipping antisense oligonucleotide that has a therapeutic effect in a mouse model of CLN3 Batten disease, a fatal pediatric lysosomal storage disease. To validate this therapeutic approach, we generated a mouse model that constitutively expresses the <italic toggle=""yes"">Cln3</italic> spliced isoform induced by the antisense molecule. Behavioral and pathological analyses of these mice demonstrate a less severe phenotype compared with the CLN3 disease mouse model, providing evidence that antisense oligonucleotide-induced exon skipping can have therapeutic efficacy in treating CLN3 Batten disease. This model highlights how protein engineering through RNA splicing modulation can be an effective therapeutic approach.  Hastings and colleagues generated a therapeutic mouse model of CLN3 Batten disease to show that correcting the open reading frame by exon skipping results in reduced disease burden. These findings validate their prior work, supporting the use of exon-skipping antisense oligonucleotides to treat patients with a <italic toggle=""yes"">CLN3</italic><sup><italic toggle=""yes"">Δex7/8</italic></sup> mutation.","CLN3 Batten disease, also known as CLN3 disease or juvenile neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis (JNCL), is an autosomal recessive, lysosomal storage disease that affects young children.

This disruption results in either nonsense-mediated decay of the mRNA or translation of a truncated protein lacking 257 amino acids at the C-terminus; however, the lack of commercially available antibodies has limited researchers’ ability to study the effects of CLN3 mutations at the protein level.<xref rid=""bib8"" ref-type=""bibr""><sup>8</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid=""bib9"" ref-type=""bibr""><sup>9</sup></xref> Though the function of CLN3 is not fully understood, the C-terminal tail of CLN3 contains a lysosomal targeting sequence and has been shown to have an important role in folding and exit from the endoplasmic reticulum.<xref rid=""bib10"" ref-type=""bibr""><sup>10</sup></xref> Additionally, most cases of CLN3 Batten disease not resulting from deletion of exons 7 and 8 are frame-shifting deletions and nonsense mutations that would lack this C-terminal domain.<xref rid=""bib11"" ref-type=""bibr""><sup>11</sup></xref> Mutations that do not result in a C-terminal truncation are associated with protracted disease<xref rid=""bib11"" ref-type=""bibr""><sup>11</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid=""bib12"" ref-type=""bibr""><sup>12</sup></xref> (NCL Mutation Database: <ext-link ext-link-type=""uri"" http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink href=""http://www.ucl.ac.uk/ncl"" id=""intref0010"">http://www.ucl.ac.uk/ncl</ext-link>), suggesting that mutations that do not result in the complete loss of CLN3 protein function may be better tolerated than frameshift mutations, which invariably cause severe forms of the disease. Based on this evidence, we reasoned that recovery of the protein coding open reading frame of <italic toggle=""yes"">CLN3</italic><sup>Δex7/8</sup> could produce a protein with at least partial function that might result in a less severe, protracted form of the disease. One approach to restore open reading frames caused by frame-shifting mutations that has shown promise in the clinic for other diseases, is to target the endogenous pre-mRNA splicing and splice out (skip) the exon or exons containing the premature termination codon using splice-switching antisense oligonucleotides (SSOs). If the exons flanking the spliced-out exon are in the same reading frame (symmetric with each other), then the resulting mRNA will encode the correct protein product, albeit with an internal deletion of the amino acids encoded by the spliced-out exon. SSOs are a type of antisense oligonucleotide (ASO) that work specifically by base-pairing to their target RNA, thereby masking the target RNA from recognition by RNA processing machinery. To date, nine ASO drugs have received approval for clinical use, five of which are based on splice-switching principles, demonstrating the utility of this ASO-mediated splice modulation for treating disease.<xref rid=""bib13"" ref-type=""bibr""><sup>13</sup></xref> SSOs are frequently utilized to block binding of the spliceosome or splicing factors and, in so doing, modulate splicing. In this way, SSOs induce alternative pre-mRNA splicing, a process whereby different mRNA-spliced isoforms are generated from the same gene.

We found that <italic toggle=""yes"">Cln3</italic><sup><italic toggle=""yes"">Δex5/7/8</italic></sup> mice have a lower disease burden both behaviorally and pathologically compared with <italic toggle=""yes"">Cln3</italic><sup><italic toggle=""yes"">Δex7/8</italic></sup> mice.

We created a mouse line that models the therapeutic strategy of deleting exon 5 in the context of the <italic toggle=""yes"">Cln3</italic><sup>Δ<italic toggle=""yes"">ex7/8</italic></sup> mutation. This <italic toggle=""yes"">Cln3</italic><sup>Δ<italic toggle=""yes"">ex5/7/8</italic></sup> mouse expresses a <italic toggle=""yes"">Cln3</italic> gene lacking exons 5, 7, and 8, which has an intact open reading frame to the natural stop codon in exon 15. We have previously shown that inducing exon 5 skipping using a splice-switching ASO is therapeutic in mice lacking exons 7 and 8.<xref rid=""bib9"" ref-type=""bibr""><sup>9</sup></xref> These <italic toggle=""yes"">Cln3</italic><sup><italic toggle=""yes"">Δex5/7/8</italic></sup> mice demonstrate an important proof-of-concept of the disease-sparing effects resulting from correcting the <italic toggle=""yes"">CLN3</italic> open reading frame by skipping exon 5, supporting the clinical development of splice-switching ASOs to achieve this goal. Indeed, we find that the <italic toggle=""yes"">Cln3</italic><sup><italic toggle=""yes"">Δex5/7/8</italic></sup> isoform ameliorates the effects of CLN3 Batten disease compared with <italic toggle=""yes"">Cln3</italic><sup><italic toggle=""yes"">Δex7/8</italic></sup> mice, validating our previous findings that SSO-mediated reading frame correction can treat features of this lysosomal storage disease.

Since the <italic toggle=""yes"">Cln3</italic><sup><italic toggle=""yes"">Δex7/8</italic></sup> mice do not have a severely shortened lifespan that is seen in patients with the disease, survival was not assessed.<xref rid=""bib36"" ref-type=""bibr""><sup>36</sup></xref> At 3 to 4 months of age, <italic toggle=""yes"">Cln3</italic><sup><italic toggle=""yes"">Δex5/7/8</italic></sup> mice showed improvements across all behavioral measures compared with <italic toggle=""yes"">Cln3</italic><sup><italic toggle=""yes"">Δex7/8</italic></sup> mice (<xref rid=""fig2"" ref-type=""fig"">Figure 2</xref>, <xref rid=""fig3"" ref-type=""fig"">Figure 3</xref>, <xref rid=""fig4"" ref-type=""fig"">Figure 4</xref>, <xref rid=""fig5"" ref-type=""fig"">Figure 5</xref>). Similarly, at 70 days of age, SCMAS accumulation in <italic toggle=""yes"">Cln3</italic><sup><italic toggle=""yes"">Δex5/7/8</italic></sup> male mice was significantly lower than that of <italic toggle=""yes"">Cln3</italic><sup><italic toggle=""yes"">Δex7/8</italic></sup> in the SS cortex and hippocampus (<xref rid=""fig6"" ref-type=""fig"">Figure 6</xref>).

This sexual dimorphism in fine motor skill deficit could be the result of earlier disease onset in male <italic toggle=""yes"">Cln3</italic><sup><italic toggle=""yes"">Δex7/8</italic></sup> mice, as suggested by the more severe SCMAS accumulation compared with females in the somatosensory cortex and hippocampus at p70, and is similar to reports of earlier disease onset seen in male patients.<xref rid=""bib7"" ref-type=""bibr""><sup>7</sup></xref> Conversely, at 3 months of age, female <italic toggle=""yes"">Cln3</italic><sup><italic toggle=""yes"">Δex7/8</italic></sup> mice had a significant decrease in forelimb grip strength, whereas male <italic toggle=""yes"">Cln3</italic><sup><italic toggle=""yes"">Δex7/8</italic></sup> mice showed no such deficit (<xref rid=""fig4"" ref-type=""fig"">Figure 4</xref>). These results are reminiscent of human disease, with reports that male patients lose physical function later than female patients, possibly due to a lower baseline muscle mass in females or differences in sex hormones, where testosterone has been shown to serve a protective role against muscle atrophy.<xref rid=""bib7"" ref-type=""bibr""><sup>7</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid=""bib49"" ref-type=""bibr""><sup>47</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid=""bib50"" ref-type=""bibr""><sup>48</sup></xref> The <italic toggle=""yes"">Cln3</italic><sup>Δ<italic toggle=""yes"">ex7/8</italic></sup> mice also exhibited sexual dimorphism in histopathology.

When seeking to develop novel interventions for a debilitating disease, it is critical to explore multiple therapeutic avenues given that a single drug can rarely serve as the “silver bullet” intervention for all patients. Along these lines, a phase I/IIa clinical trial for adeno-associated virus (AAV)-mediated gene therapy in CLN3 Batten disease is ongoing (NCT03770572).<xref rid=""bib56"" ref-type=""bibr""><sup>54</sup></xref> Comparing our treatment modality with the available preclinical AAV data, we note that the therapeutic outcomes reported in the current study are similar to those previously seen in <italic toggle=""yes"">Cln3</italic><sup><italic toggle=""yes"">Δex7/8</italic></sup> mice treated with <italic toggle=""yes"">hCLN3</italic> gene therapy.

"Extracellular Vesicles Released by Genetically Modified Macrophages Activate Autophagy and Produce Potent Neuroprotection in Mouse Model of Lysosomal Storage Disorder, Batten Disease","Over the recent decades, the use of extracellular vesicles (EVs) has attracted considerable attention. Herein, we report the development of a novel EV-based drug delivery system for the transport of the lysosomal enzyme tripeptidyl peptidase-1 (TPP1) to treat Batten disease (BD). Endogenous loading of macrophage-derived EVs was achieved through transfection of parent cells with TPP1-encoding <italic toggle=""yes"">p</italic>DNA. More than 20% ID/g was detected in the brain following a single intrathecal injection of EVs in a mouse model of BD, ceroid lipofuscinosis neuronal type 2 (CLN2) mice. Furthermore, the cumulative effect of EVs repetitive administrations in the brain was demonstrated. TPP1-loaded EVs (EV-TPP1) produced potent therapeutic effects, resulting in efficient elimination of lipofuscin aggregates in lysosomes, decreased inflammation, and improved neuronal survival in CLN2 mice. In terms of mechanism, EV-TPP1 treatments caused significant activation of the autophagy pathway, including altered expression of the autophagy-related proteins LC3 and P62, in the CLN2 mouse brain. We hypothesized that along with TPP1 delivery to the brain, EV-based formulations can enhance host cellular homeostasis, causing degradation of lipofuscin aggregates through the autophagy–lysosomal pathway. Overall, continued research into new and effective therapies for BD is crucial for improving the lives of those affected by this condition.","Lysosomal storage disorders (LSDs) are a group of inherited genetic disorders characterized by the accumulation of various substances within lysosomes that build up due to a deficiency in lysosomal enzymes. LSDs manifested in a range of symptoms, including developmental delays, organ damage, and neurological problems. There are over 50 different LSDs, each of which is caused by a mutation in a specific gene that encodes for a specific lysosomal enzyme. Batten disease (BD), also known as neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis (NCL), is a group of rare and severe neurodegenerative disorders that affect children. It is characterized by the accumulation of harmful substances called lipofuscins within cells, particularly in the brain, leading to the progressive loss of nerve cells, blindness, and the development of neurological problems. Specifically, late infantile neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis type 2 (CLN2) is one of the most common forms of LSDs. CLN2 results from a deficiency of the lysosomal enzyme tripeptidyl peptidase 1 (TPP1), a serine protease that cleaves tripeptides from the N-terminus of proteins and localizes to lysosomes and extracellularly. Without functional TPP1, there is no appropriate clearance of lipofuscin aggregates, resulting in their progressive accumulation in lysosomes. Although these aggregates buildup in lysosomes of all cells, the main damage occurs in neurons of the central nervous system (CNS) and the retina, which undergo progressive degeneration [<xref rid=""B1-cells-12-01497"" ref-type=""bibr"">1</xref>]. Subsequently, many tissues and organ systems are affected, with early loss of neurological functions and vision [<xref rid=""B2-cells-12-01497"" ref-type=""bibr"">2</xref>], leading to severe disability and early death. As such, efficient delivery of functional TPP1 to the CNS is of great importance. The treatment of BD is challenging due to the nature of the disorder and the lack of effective therapies that can reach lysosomes in the CNS. Currently, there is no cure for BD, and treatment is largely supportive, focusing on managing symptoms and providing supportive care. This may include the use of medications to control seizures, physical and occupational therapy to improve mobility and function, and the use of assistive devices, such as wheelchairs and feeding tubes. Enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) is the most developed approach for treatment of CLN2 that is already implemented in clinics; however, successful treatment of patients can be accomplished only through catheters implanted in the lateral ventricle (intracerebroventricular) [<xref rid=""B3-cells-12-01497"" ref-type=""bibr"">3</xref>]. In general, the patients showed positive effects of ERT with substantial delay of motor, language and visual decline and reduction in cortical volume loss. Unfortunately, the therapeutic efficacy diminished over time [<xref rid=""B4-cells-12-01497"" ref-type=""bibr"">4</xref>]. Gene therapy via modified adeno-associated viruses (AAVs) is another experimental approach that is being explored as a potential treatment for BD [<xref rid=""B5-cells-12-01497"" ref-type=""bibr"">5</xref>,<xref rid=""B6-cells-12-01497"" ref-type=""bibr"">6</xref>]. This involves the introduction of a functioning copy of the mutated <italic toggle=""yes"">tpp1</italic> gene into cells, with the goal of restoring normal function. While gene therapy holds promise as a treatment for BD, it is still in the early stages of development and has not yet been approved for use in humans.  The challenges in the treatment of BD highlight the need for continued research into new and effective therapies for this devastating disorder. Advances in nanotechnology research may lead to the development of new treatments that can improve the lives of those affected by this condition. Overall, many potent therapeutics require efficient delivery systems, such as nanocarriers that protect the incorporated drug against degradation, improve its pharmacokinetics, and decrease side effects. A multitude of synthetic nanocarriers, including inorganic nanoparticles [<xref rid=""B7-cells-12-01497"" ref-type=""bibr"">7</xref>], polymer-based nanoparticles and micelles [<xref rid=""B8-cells-12-01497"" ref-type=""bibr"">8</xref>,<xref rid=""B9-cells-12-01497"" ref-type=""bibr"">9</xref>,<xref rid=""B10-cells-12-01497"" ref-type=""bibr"">10</xref>], liposomes [<xref rid=""B11-cells-12-01497"" ref-type=""bibr"">11</xref>,<xref rid=""B12-cells-12-01497"" ref-type=""bibr"">12</xref>,<xref rid=""B13-cells-12-01497"" ref-type=""bibr"">13</xref>,<xref rid=""B14-cells-12-01497"" ref-type=""bibr"">14</xref>], and solid lipid-based nanoparticles (SLN) [<xref rid=""B15-cells-12-01497"" ref-type=""bibr"">15</xref>,<xref rid=""B16-cells-12-01497"" ref-type=""bibr"">16</xref>], have been developed from a variety of materials for improved drug delivery and even introduced to the market [<xref rid=""B17-cells-12-01497"" ref-type=""bibr"">17</xref>]. Some of them, especially SLN, have shown promising results [<xref rid=""B18-cells-12-01497"" ref-type=""bibr"">18</xref>,<xref rid=""B19-cells-12-01497"" ref-type=""bibr"">19</xref>,<xref rid=""B20-cells-12-01497"" ref-type=""bibr"">20</xref>,<xref rid=""B21-cells-12-01497"" ref-type=""bibr"">21</xref>]. However, the efficacy of conventional nanoparticles and nanoformulations is limited due to their cytotoxicity and fast clearance by phagocytes, as well as inadequate drug-loading efficiency, leakage during storage, and costly production process [<xref rid=""B22-cells-12-01497"" ref-type=""bibr"">22</xref>]. In addition, they have a limited ability to penetrate across biological barriers, such as the blood–brain barrier (BBB) or blood–retina barrier (BRB). As such, there is an urgent need for more biocompatible therapeutic approaches based on natural drug carriers’ systems. EVs, exosomes, and microvesicles are small, membrane-bound vesicles that are secreted by cells. They contain a variety of biomolecules, including nucleic acids, proteins, and lipids, and are emerging as potential drug delivery vehicles. EVs are prominent nanocarriers that play important roles in the intercellular communications and can provide crucial benefits for drug delivery. EVs are small and can cross the BBB, which makes them well-suited for targeting specific areas of the brain. Unlike synthetic nanocarriers, EVs have a biological origin, making them safer and less immunogenic [<xref rid=""B23-cells-12-01497"" ref-type=""bibr"">23</xref>]. While conventional nanoparticles are usually cleared quickly by the mononuclear phagocyte system (MPS), EVs contain certain proteins on their surface that allow them to avoid entrapment in MPS and facilitate delivery of their therapeutic cargo to the disease site [<xref rid=""B24-cells-12-01497"" ref-type=""bibr"">24</xref>,<xref rid=""B25-cells-12-01497"" ref-type=""bibr"">25</xref>]. They also have a natural ability to target and enter specific cells, which can help increase the efficiency of drug delivery. Furthermore, due to EVs’ natural targeting capacity and ability to penetrate the interstitia of organs, they can minimize systemic toxicity [<xref rid=""B22-cells-12-01497"" ref-type=""bibr"">22</xref>]. These findings supported the notion that EVs have an unrivaled efficacy compared to synthetic drug nanoformulations that can provide powerful treatment for conditions lacking effective pharmacotherapy, such as neurodegenerative disorders [<xref rid=""B26-cells-12-01497"" ref-type=""bibr"">26</xref>]. Regarding therapeutic interventions for LSDs, EVs have a high stability and low immunogenicity, while favoring acidic conditions for fusing; therefore, they may be especially instrumental in the delivery of therapeutic enzymes to the target organelles, lysosomes. As a result, the use of EVs not only reduces the drug dosage, but also enables the administration of drugs through less invasive routes (intravenous, intranasal, intraperitoneal, etc.), providing greater benefit in the clinical aspect. We reported earlier on the development of formulations that contained TPP1 exogenously loaded into macrophage derived EVs [<xref rid=""B27-cells-12-01497"" ref-type=""bibr"">27</xref>,<xref rid=""B28-cells-12-01497"" ref-type=""bibr"">28</xref>]. This drug delivery system was shown to provide significant neuroprotective and anti-inflammatory effects in a BD mouse model, CLN2 mice. Herein, we report a newly developed drug delivery system revolving around EVs released by autologous macrophages that were transfected with TPP1-encoding plasmid DNA (<italic toggle=""yes"">p</italic>DNA). We demonstrate that TPP1 delivered to the brain by means of macrophage derived EVs caused a significant improvement in the morphology and survival of neuronal cells, along with increased expression of growth factors and decreased secretion of inflammatory molecules.  In terms of mechanism, we show that treatment with EV-TPP1 activates natural defense systems in the CLN2 mouse brain, namely, the autophagy pathway. Autophagy is a process that occurs in cells and uses lysosomes for the degradation and recycling of cellular components. This pathway is particularly important in the context of LSDs, which are characterized by an accumulation of various substances within lysosomes, the cells’ waste disposal system. Studies have shown that many LSDs, and in particular the NCLs, are characterized by an impaired autophagy pathway [<xref rid=""B29-cells-12-01497"" ref-type=""bibr"">29</xref>,<xref rid=""B30-cells-12-01497"" ref-type=""bibr"">30</xref>]. Specifically, it was discovered that the primary storage material (i.e., intracellular material that is delivered into the lysosome for degradation and recycling) disrupts the normal role of the lysosome in the autophagy pathway, resulting in the secondary storage of autophagic debris [<xref rid=""B30-cells-12-01497"" ref-type=""bibr"">30</xref>]. On the other hand, activation of the autophagy pathway can mitigate the effects of LSDs by providing an alternative mechanism for the degradation and recycling of cellular components. The formation of autophagosomes, characterized by small vesicles enclosed with damaged or unnecessary cellular components fuses with lysosomes for degradation. In this way, together with the lysosomal function, the autophagy pathway can prevent the toxic effects of the accumulating compounds underlying the pathophysiology of LSDs.  Herein, we show that successful delivery of EV-TPP1 to the CLN2 mouse brain accounted for the altered expression of the autophagy-related protein 8, ATG8, /microtubule-associated protein light chain 3 (LC3), involved in the formation of autophagosomes, and the receptor for P62 (also referred to as sequestosome 1, SQSTM1), which directs protein cargo for autophagic degradation. We hypothesized that the therapeutic action of EV-TPP1 is twofold: (i) efficient delivery of therapeutically active enzyme TPP1 to lysosomes, and (ii) activation of protein aggregates clearance through the autophagy–lysosomal pathway. Both processes may be interconnected, amplifying the overall therapeutic effect. Ongoing studies in the lab using the CLN2 mouse model are currently examining how these autophagy-related processes contribute to the pathological mechanism of the NCLs and investigating the effect of EV-TPP1 on their activation. Understanding these mechanisms may provide new treatment approaches for this debilitating disorder.   There have been several studies investigating the use of EVs as drug delivery vehicles. Several groups report successful loading and delivery of therapeutic proteins to the brain by means of EVs for drug delivery in animal models, including neurodegenerative disorders [<xref rid=""B23-cells-12-01497"" ref-type=""bibr"">23</xref>,<xref rid=""B26-cells-12-01497"" ref-type=""bibr"">26</xref>,<xref rid=""B36-cells-12-01497"" ref-type=""bibr"">36</xref>,<xref rid=""B48-cells-12-01497"" ref-type=""bibr"">48</xref>,<xref rid=""B49-cells-12-01497"" ref-type=""bibr"">49</xref>,<xref rid=""B50-cells-12-01497"" ref-type=""bibr"">50</xref>,<xref rid=""B51-cells-12-01497"" ref-type=""bibr"">51</xref>,<xref rid=""B52-cells-12-01497"" ref-type=""bibr"">52</xref>,<xref rid=""B53-cells-12-01497"" ref-type=""bibr"">53</xref>], lysosomal storage diseases [<xref rid=""B27-cells-12-01497"" ref-type=""bibr"">27</xref>,<xref rid=""B28-cells-12-01497"" ref-type=""bibr"">28</xref>], and multiple sclerosis [<xref rid=""B54-cells-12-01497"" ref-type=""bibr"">54</xref>]. These studies have shown promising results and suggested that EVs may be an effective means of transporting drugs to the brain in these disorders. For example, brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) was delivered successfully using EVs to the brain parenchyma in healthy mice and at even greater amounts to the inflamed brains [<xref rid=""B23-cells-12-01497"" ref-type=""bibr"">23</xref>]. In another study, a potent antioxidant catalase was loaded into exosomes ex vivo and produced significant neuroprotective effects using in vitro and in vivo models of Parkinson’s disease [<xref rid=""B49-cells-12-01497"" ref-type=""bibr"">49</xref>]. Yet, one of the main challenges of EV-based therapeutics is the efficient loading of these natural nanocarriers with therapeutic proteins without altering the structure and content of EVs membranes. In the present study, we demonstrated a successful loading of EVs with the therapeutic enzyme TPP1 via genetic modification of parent macrophages with TPP1-encopding <italic toggle=""yes"">p</italic>DNA. We adjusted experimental conditions to achieve efficient transfection of macrophages and confirmed TPP1 expression in parent cells and EVs with ELISA.  Another hurdle for these therapeutic interventions, especially in the case of neurodegenerative disorders, is the efficient targeting of EVs with incorporated drug to the disease site. To this point, we suggest utilizing immunocytes as a source for EVs production that target inflamed tissues. We reported earlier a significant increase in the accumulation levels of EVs released by inflammatory response cells, monocytes, and macrophages in the inflamed brain tissues [<xref rid=""B23-cells-12-01497"" ref-type=""bibr"">23</xref>,<xref rid=""B36-cells-12-01497"" ref-type=""bibr"">36</xref>]. As reported earlier by us, macrophage derived EVs (mEVs) were found to have a superior ability to accumulate in the inflamed mouse brain, compared to astrocyte-derived EVs (aEVs) or neuron-derived EVs (nEVs), although in vitro nEVs were taken up by neurons in greater quantity [<xref rid=""B38-cells-12-01497"" ref-type=""bibr"">38</xref>]. We showed that the unidirectional brain influx rate (Ki) and initial volume of brain distribution (Vi) of EVs in the brain-inflamed mice were respectively three- and twofold higher than those in the healthy mice. Consistent with the increased brain influx rate, the brain accumulation of macrophage-derived EVs in the inflamed brain at 10 min was 5.8-fold higher than that in the healthy mice [<xref rid=""B23-cells-12-01497"" ref-type=""bibr"">23</xref>]. We uncovered the mechanism of mEVs superior accumulation in the inflamed brain, and these mEVs showed the highest levels of tetraspanins and integrins compared with nEVs and aEVs, which allows higher adhesion and targeting to the inflamed tissues by mEVs. The targeting effect was also supported by the interaction between the integrin lymphocyte function-associated antigen 1 (LFA-1) overexpressed on the mEVs surface and intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM-1) on the inflamed endothelial cells of brain microcapillaries [<xref rid=""B23-cells-12-01497"" ref-type=""bibr"">23</xref>].  Herein, we utilized macrophage-derived EVs and established optimal schedule and administration routes for treatment with EV-TPP1 formulations in CLN2 mice. Based on our previous data, we used a combination of two administration routes, <italic toggle=""yes"">i.t.</italic> and <italic toggle=""yes"">i.p.</italic> injections. The first one provided proficient delivery of the enzyme to the brain, and the last supplied TPP1 to the main peripheral organs including the liver, spleen, and kidneys. Subsequently, we studied the biodistribution of fluorescently labeled EVs in the main organs of CLN2 mice upon multiple administrations using imaging in living animals (IVIS). The studies revealed the steady-state increase of EVs accumulation upon multiple injections, which suggested sufficient delivery of the incorporated TPP1 to the brain. This resulted in significant restoration of neuronal structure and tissue integrity in the brain of CLN2 mice treated with EV-TPP1, as was showed by histological and immunohistochemical analyses. Thus, noticeable healthy morphology in tissue structure and high integrity of neurons was detected in the brain of CLN2 mice treated with EV-TPP1 when comparted to CLN2 mice treated with saline. Specifically, EV-TPP1 treatments resulted in rescued astrocytes morphology and enhanced neuronal survival in CLN2 brain tissues. Furthermore, a significant decrease in pro-inflammatory molecules (MCP-1 and RANTES), along with an increase in the levels of different growth factors (GM-CSF, bFGF, M-CSF and IGF), were detected in CLN2 mice treated with EV-TPP1 when compared to CLN2 mice treated with saline. These findings are important considering that both G-CSF and GM-CSF were shown to have a protective function in neurons [<xref rid=""B45-cells-12-01497"" ref-type=""bibr"">45</xref>], while IGF-1 was known to exhibit neuroprotective functions, including synaptic formation, neuronal plasticity, protein synthesis, and autophagy [<xref rid=""B44-cells-12-01497"" ref-type=""bibr"">44</xref>]. Furthermore, hematopoietic trophic cytokine, such as GM-CSF, was shown to inhibit the neurodegenerative effects of paraquat in a Parkinson’s disease mouse model [<xref rid=""B55-cells-12-01497"" ref-type=""bibr"">55</xref>]. IGFs stimulates DNA synthesis, cell proliferation, neurite outgrowth, axonal growth, and myelination and enhances the secretion of various neurotransmitters. According to others, in many neurodegenerative diseases, decreases in IGF-1 signals [<xref rid=""B56-cells-12-01497"" ref-type=""bibr"">56</xref>] and lack of IGF-1 in the brain may induce apoptosis [<xref rid=""B57-cells-12-01497"" ref-type=""bibr"">57</xref>,<xref rid=""B58-cells-12-01497"" ref-type=""bibr"">58</xref>]. In some neurodegenerative diseases, M-CSF and microglia were shown to be highly beneficial in clearing amyloid, preventing its toxicity to neurons, and improving cognitive impairment. Importantly, sham EVs did not cause significant therapeutic effects in CLN2 brain. Regarding the mechanism of EV-TPP1 therapeutic effects, our initial hypothesis was that EVs would facilitate targeted delivery of TPP1, especially to the brain, and protect neurons against the appearance of lysosome aggregates. In fact, neuronal accumulation of autofluorescent lipopigments resembling ceroid and lipofuscin, as well as mitochondrial ATP synthase subunit C, has been found in CLN patients [<xref rid=""B59-cells-12-01497"" ref-type=""bibr"">59</xref>,<xref rid=""B60-cells-12-01497"" ref-type=""bibr"">60</xref>]. As such, we investigated whether treatments with EV-TPP1 resulted in clearance of these aggregates. As expected, accumulation of EV-TPP1 in the brain caused desegregation of protein aggregates and protection of neurons. These effects were significantly greater in mice treated with EV-TPP1 formulations compared to CLN2 mice treated with sham EVs. This suggests that delivery of TPP1 by means of EVs or/and maybe delivery of TPP1-encoding DNA and de novo synthesis in the CLN2 mouse brain are responsible for these therapeutic effects. To clarify the last point about de novo synthesis of TPP1, we demonstrated earlier that along with the encoded enzyme, EVs released by pre-transfected macrophages contain TPP1-encoding DNA [<xref rid=""B27-cells-12-01497"" ref-type=""bibr"">27</xref>], suggesting that along with the enzyme transfer, EV-TPP1 released by transfected macrophages may also deliver TPP1-encoding DNA and accomplish gene delivery to the brain of CLN2 mice. This would result in the transfection of brain tissues and de novo synthesis of TPP1 promotes neuroprotection.  Another hypothesis is based on the note that accumulation of aggregates due to incapable enzymes in BD patients resulted in the disruption of the autophagic pathway, further producing “collateral damage” in the clearance of protein aggregates. Interestingly, along with BD, this process was reported for different LSDs, including Pompe, Cystinosis, Danon, and Gaucher diseases [<xref rid=""B30-cells-12-01497"" ref-type=""bibr"">30</xref>]. As such, autophagy plays a crucial role in the maintenance of lysosomal function in these disorders. Increasing numbers of studies have linked a defective autophagy process to the neuronal ceroid lipofuscinoses [<xref rid=""B29-cells-12-01497"" ref-type=""bibr"">29</xref>,<xref rid=""B61-cells-12-01497"" ref-type=""bibr"">61</xref>]. The most used techniques include the inhibition of lysosomal function (i.e., by chloroquine) and evaluation of the level of autophagy substrates, such as ubiquitinated proteins and SQSTM1/P62 [<xref rid=""B62-cells-12-01497"" ref-type=""bibr"">62</xref>]. LC3 is attached on the cytosolic side of the autophagosome and functions as a receptor for the scaffolding protein SQSTM1/P62, which directs protein cargo for autophagic degradation or flux [<xref rid=""B63-cells-12-01497"" ref-type=""bibr"">63</xref>,<xref rid=""B64-cells-12-01497"" ref-type=""bibr"">64</xref>,<xref rid=""B65-cells-12-01497"" ref-type=""bibr"">65</xref>]. Failure to increase LC3-II following chloroquine treatment and elevated levels of SQSTM1/P62 indicate an impairment of the flux. On the other hand, a decrease in the expression levels of SQSTM1/P62 is indicative of autophagic flux in the autophagy–lysosomal pathway and clearance of intracellular aggregates. In addition to the development of novel methods of delivery of the therapeutic enzyme to the brain, there is ongoing research into the potential use of autophagy-inducing agents as a therapeutic approach for LSDs. While these agents have shown promise in animal models, more research is needed to determine their effectiveness and safety in humans.  Herein we focused on these two essential proteins (LC3 and SQSTM1/P62) in the autophagy pathway. Of most importance is the notion that EV-TPP1 activated the autophagy pathway, which may have started a secondary process that improved the delivery of aggregates to lysosomes and their clearance. Our findings show that EV-TPP1 induced upregulation of the autophagosome marker LC3 in CLN2 mouse brain. Interestingly, CLN2 mice treated with saline or sham EVs showed a low level of LC3 immunoreactivity, when compared to EV-TPP1-treated CLN2 brain, indicating that autophagy was not being induced. At the same time, only brains administered with EV-TPP1 showed a decrease in the marker of autophagy flux, SQSTM1/p62, suggesting that the neuronal injury detected with CLN2 may be partially attributed to a blockade of autophagy maturation or flux. Interestingly, mRNA analysis revealed upregulation of the <italic toggle=""yes"">SQSTM1/P62</italic> gene in the CLN2 brain after the EV-TPP1 treatments, suggesting that the decreased levels in protein expression was not due to lack of de novo synthesis gene expression. We developed a novel biomimetic drug delivery system for TPP1 based on macrophage derived EVs as drug delivery vehicles. Multiple facets of medicine can be improved with the development of EV-derived drug delivery systems, including tumor treatments, cancer treatments, vaccines, and more. Based on our data and gene array data, we further speculate that the CLN2 brain, upon receiving the EV-TPP1 formulation, not only induces autophagy but is able to restore lysosomal degradation. This, in turn, could be a potential mechanism by which neurons are restored. Enhanced lysosomal degradation can lead to reduced inflammation in the brain and throughout the body. At least two different processes may be supportive of EV-TPP1 treatment: (i) delivery of active TPP1 and TPP1-encoding <italic toggle=""yes"">p</italic>DNA and (ii) activation of the autophagy process in the brain of CLN2 mice. Overall, the role of autophagy in LSDs is significant and continues to be an active area of research. While EVs show promise as a tool for the treatment of neurodegenerative disorders, further studies are needed to fully understand their potential and to identify any potential drawbacks or challenges.",N/A,29 5 2023
Magnetic resonance brain volumetry biomarkers of CLN2 Batten disease identified with miniswine model,"Late-infantile neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis type 2 (CLN2) disease (Batten disease) is a rare pediatric disease, with symptom development leading to clinical diagnosis. Early diagnosis and effective tracking of disease progression are required for treatment. We hypothesize that brain volumetry is valuable in identifying CLN2 disease at an early stage and tracking disease progression in a genetically modified miniswine model. <italic toggle=""yes"">CLN2</italic><sup><italic toggle=""yes"">R208X/R208X</italic></sup> miniswine and wild type controls were evaluated at 12- and 17-months of age, correlating to early and late stages of disease progression. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) T1- and T2-weighted data were acquired. Total intercranial, gray matter, cerebrospinal fluid, white matter, caudate, putamen, and ventricle volumes were calculated and expressed as proportions of the intracranial volume. The brain regions were compared between timepoints and cohorts using Gardner-Altman plots, mean differences, and confidence intervals. At an early stage of disease, the total intracranial volume (− 9.06 cm<sup>3</sup>), gray matter (− 4.37% 95 CI − 7.41; − 1.83), caudate (− 0.16%, 95 CI − 0.24; − 0.08) and putamen (− 0.11% 95 CI − 0.23; − 0.02) were all notably smaller in <italic toggle=""yes"">CLN2</italic><sup><italic toggle=""yes"">R208X/R208X</italic></sup> miniswines versus WT, while cerebrospinal fluid was larger (+ 3.42%, 95 CI 2.54; 6.18). As the disease progressed to a later stage, the difference between the gray matter (− 8.27%, 95 CI − 10.1; − 5.56) and cerebrospinal fluid (+ 6.88%, 95 CI 4.31; 8.51) continued to become more pronounced, while others remained stable. MRI brain volumetry in this miniswine model of CLN2 disease is sensitive to early disease detection and longitudinal change monitoring, providing a valuable tool for pre-clinical treatment development and evaluation.","Batten disease, or neuronal ceroid lipofuscinoses, is a group of neurodegenerative diseases in which mutations in 13–14 different genes can cause issues with a lysosome’s capability to recycle or process molecules. All forms of Batten disease show similar symptoms but are caused by different gene mutations<sup><xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR1"">1</xref>,<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR2"">2</xref></sup>. The late-infantile neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis type 2 (CLN2) disease is rare, and usually not diagnosed until the patient is already symptomatic. This disease occurs in children around 2–4 years of age causing early brain degeneration and cognitive decline, in addition to the loss of visual and motor functions, ultimately leading to death<sup><xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR2"">2</xref>–<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR4"">4</xref></sup>. These regressions are caused by an enzyme deficiency of tripeptidyl peptidase 1, which causes an inability to remove waste that would normally be metabolized by lysosomes<sup><xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR1"">1</xref></sup>. No cure exists for CLN2 disease, but enzyme replacement therapy protocols have been approved as a method to slow disease progression<sup><xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR5"">5</xref></sup>. For these replacement therapies to be effective, they must be administered as soon as possible. Early disease recognition and initiation of therapy are essential in treating patients with CLN2 disease. Disease frequency within CLN2 is not well reported across the world population, with sources varying from 0.15 to 9 in 100,000 births<sup><xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR6"">6</xref>–<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR8"">8</xref></sup>. This low frequency in the population hinders single-center study recruitment and data collection, making consistent longitudinal data acquisition of humans affected by CLN2 disease difficult. It is particularly challenging to obtain data at a pre-symptomatic stage of the disease. MRI studies have been completed with human subjects with CLN2 disease, but the imaging studies used are at variable points in the disease course due to differences in disease onset, diagnosis, and patient availability<sup><xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR9"">9</xref></sup>. Therefore, there is a need to model CLN2 disease progression from pre- to post-symptomatic stages that is standardized. One way to analyze disease progression in neurodegenerative diseases is through volumetrics from non-invasive medical imaging, such as MRI, as a measure of cerebral atrophy. Cerebral atrophy is the loss of neurons in the brain, which results in overall brain tissue shrinkage. Batten disease studies in humans have used volumetric analysis to show noteworthy gray matter (GM) and white matter (WM) atrophy over time<sup><xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR9"">9</xref>,<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR10"">10</xref></sup>. Additionally, CLN2 disease studies that include volumetric analysis show ventricular expansion and higher overall volumes of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) compared to a normal brain<sup><xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR10"">10</xref></sup> An increase in total CSF volume is one potential sign of neurodegenerative progression when observed in combination with intracranial volume (ICV), GM, and WM changes<sup><xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR11"">11</xref>,<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR12"">12</xref></sup>. The purpose of our study is to test our hypothesis that brain volumetry at 12- and 17-months for <italic toggle=""yes"">CLN2</italic><sup><italic toggle=""yes"">R208X/R208X</italic></sup> miniswine differs from that of wild type controls. We hypothesize that degeneration due to <italic toggle=""yes"">CLN2</italic><sup><italic toggle=""yes"">R208X/R208X</italic></sup> will mirror reported brain tissue degeneration in humans with CLN2 disease. Volumetric analysis of specific regional brain degeneration in miniswine affected by <italic toggle=""yes"">CLN2</italic><sup><italic toggle=""yes"">R208X/R208X</italic></sup> can then be used as early biomarkers for disease progression severity in patients and for monitoring pre-clinical therapy response.  Thirty-eight scans were analyzed, comprised of fourteen 12-month-old <italic toggle=""yes"">CLN2</italic><sup><italic toggle=""yes"">R208X/R208X</italic></sup> miniswine scan sessions, fourteen 17-month-old miniswine scan sessions, five WT 12-month-old miniswine scan sessions, and five WT 17-month-old miniswine scans scan sessions. Ten of the <italic toggle=""yes"">CLN2</italic><sup><italic toggle=""yes"">R208X/R208X</italic></sup> miniswine had scan data available for both 12- and 17-month time points. Representative images of the MRI data for WT and <italic toggle=""yes"">CLN2</italic><sup><italic toggle=""yes"">R208X/R208X</italic></sup> are shown in Fig. <xref rid=""Fig1"" ref-type=""fig"">1</xref>. All five WT animals had 12- and 17-month time point scans acquired. A single <italic toggle=""yes"">CLN2</italic><sup><italic toggle=""yes"">R208X/R208X</italic></sup> 12-month scan session was left out due to scan quality causing segmentation failure for automated extraction of the GM, WM and CSF. Diffusion-weighted imaging data were collected but included pronounced artifact, caused primarily due to the large, complex sinus structure of the miniswine, hence these data were not quantitatively analyzed in this study.<fig id=""Fig1""><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Exemplary T1-weighted (T1w) and T2-weighted (T2w) MRI data from a <italic toggle=""yes"">CLN2</italic><sup><italic toggle=""yes"">R208X/R208X</italic></sup> miniswine at 12-months-of-age (top left) and 17-months (top right), and a wild type (WT) comparator (bottom).

At an early stage of disease progression (12-months-of-age in the miniswine model), we found meaningful differences in the ICV proportional volumes of GM (reduced in <italic toggle=""yes"">CLN2</italic><sup><italic toggle=""yes"">R208X/R208X</italic></sup>), caudate (reduced in <italic toggle=""yes"">CLN2</italic><sup><italic toggle=""yes"">R208X/R208X</italic></sup>), putamen (reduced in <italic toggle=""yes"">CLN2</italic><sup><italic toggle=""yes"">R208X/R208X</italic></sup>) and CSF (elevated in <italic toggle=""yes"">CLN2</italic><sup><italic toggle=""yes"">R208X/R208X</italic></sup>) between <italic toggle=""yes"">CLN2</italic><sup><italic toggle=""yes"">R208X/R208X</italic></sup> and WT cohorts. As the diseased progressed to a late stage (17-months-of-age in the miniswine model), the difference in the ICV proportional volumes of GM and CSF became more pronounced, while the other measurement differences remained relatively consistent to the 12-month relationship. This indicates that evaluation of MRI derived brain volumes could be utilized to monitor treatment response in preclinical miniswine studies. Characterization of the <italic toggle=""yes"">CLN2</italic><sup><italic toggle=""yes"">R208X/R208X</italic></sup> miniswine model used for this study has recently been reported by Swier et al.<sup><xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR13"">13</xref></sup> incorporating behavioral, pathological, and visual testing regularly from 3-months to 18-months-of-age. This study demonstrated the age of onset of phenotypes for female <italic toggle=""yes"">CLN2</italic><sup><italic toggle=""yes"">R208X/R208X</italic></sup> miniswine including overt vision deficits at a mean age of 15-months, motor coordination loss at a mean age of 16-months, and early death at a mean age of 17.5-months. At 12 months-of-age, reversal learning deficits were observed in <italic toggle=""yes"">CLN2</italic><sup><italic toggle=""yes"">R208X/R208X</italic></sup> females during t-maze testing<sup><xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR13"">13</xref></sup>, similar to that observed in other Batten disease large animal models <italic toggle=""yes"">(TPP1</italic><sup><italic toggle=""yes"">−/−</italic></sup> dog and <italic toggle=""yes"">CLN5</italic> sheep models)<sup><xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR30"">30</xref>–<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR32"">32</xref></sup>, as animals approached end-stage, reversal deficits increased. Accumulation of SubC in the somatosensory cortex, consistent with the findings from Swier et al.<sup><xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR13"">13</xref></sup>, are presented for a subset of the miniswine that underwent MRI analysis as a connection to these characterization studies. Correlation between SubC measures and MRI brain volumetry did not reach statistical significance in this study, potentially due to the small sample size for which ex-vivo tissue samples were available. Miniswine present a valuable translational research tool for exploring and optimizing medical image acquisition and analysis, understanding disease etiology, and exploring innovative treatment options. Genetically modified miniswine have been used for advancing a broad range of diseases including cystic fibrosis, cancer, neurofibromatosis, and others<sup><xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR33"">33</xref>–<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR47"">47</xref></sup>. For neurological studies, the brain morphology development and gray to white matter ratios in miniswine are similar to humans. Porcine models have been used to study neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer’s and traumatic brain injury<sup><xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR48"">48</xref>,<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR49"">49</xref></sup>. Genetically modified miniswine can have standardized brain image acquisition times at pre-determined longitudinal timepoints, creating a more consistent representation of <italic toggle=""yes"">CLN2</italic><sup><italic toggle=""yes"">R208X/R208X</italic></sup> disease progression which is challenging to achieve in humans for rare pediatric diseases. Beyond the miniswine, Batten disease imaging studies have been completed in other large animal models such as sheep (CLN5 and CLN6)<sup><xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR50"">50</xref></sup>, and non-human primates (CLN7), as well as CLN2 dachshund studies that focused on multifocal retinopathy and extraneuronal pathology<sup><xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR39"">39</xref>,<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR51"">51</xref>,<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR52"">52</xref></sup>. Expression of brain volumetry as a proportion of total ICV is commonly used in neurological disease studies to compensate between-subject variation in head size at both juvenile and elderly stage disease progressions<sup><xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR53"">53</xref>,<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR54"">54</xref></sup>. In this miniswine model, ICV volumes showed a longitudinal decrease across the <italic toggle=""yes"">CLN2</italic><sup><italic toggle=""yes"">R208X/R208X</italic></sup> cohort, as opposed to ICV longitudinal volume increase for the WT cohort. The average ICV volumetric difference at the 17-month time point was larger between the <italic toggle=""yes"">CLN2</italic><sup><italic toggle=""yes"">R208X/R208X</italic></sup> and WT cohorts than at 12-months. This serves as a baseline identifier that is consistent with a recent longitudinal NCL sheep study, which also showed a longitudinal decrease in ICV for CLN5 and CLN6 affected sheep as compared to a control cohort that showed an ICV increase over time<sup><xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR50"">50</xref>,<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR55"">55</xref></sup>. Russell et al. hypothesized this ICV reduction could be caused by ventricular shunting<sup><xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR50"">50</xref></sup>. Ventricular shunting, or a widening in the CSF fluid draining pathways in the brain, can cause decreased pressure of the brain and CSF against the skull. This may result in a thickening of the skull to balance out the pressure differential of the affected subjects and a decreased ICV. Our results indicate that while some <italic toggle=""yes"">CLN2</italic><sup><italic toggle=""yes"">R208X/R208X</italic></sup> miniswine failed to thrive as indicated by low weight gain over a five-month period, there was no correlation between change in ICV volume and weight change (Fig. <xref rid=""Fig2"" ref-type=""fig"">2</xref>). GM ICV proportional measurements at both 12- and 17-months showed the largest longitudinal proportion change, which is in line with other neurodegenerative diseases effecting motor control such as Alzheimer’s and Huntington’s disease<sup><xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR56"">56</xref>,<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR57"">57</xref></sup>. The longitudinal progression trend for GM ICV proportion follows that of a human study of CLN2 disease that showed a decrease in GM is a significant marker for disease progression, with the highest decrease found in the supratentorial region of the brain<sup><xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR9"">9</xref>,<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR10"">10</xref>,<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR58"">58</xref></sup>. The longitudinal increase in CSF associated with CLN2 disease progression, as was found in our <italic toggle=""yes"">CLN2</italic><sup><italic toggle=""yes"">R208X/R208X</italic></sup> miniswine and human patients<sup><xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR10"">10</xref>,<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR59"">59</xref></sup>, supports this miniswine model as a translatable model. In our study, caudate and putamen proportion of ICV in <italic toggle=""yes"">CLN2</italic><sup><italic toggle=""yes"">R208X/R208X</italic></sup> miniswine were smaller than WT counterparts. This finding is supported by similar findings by Löbel et al. in a human patient study that examined segmentation of basal ganglia and thalami in CLN2<sup><xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR10"">10</xref></sup>. The increase in ventricle proportion in the <italic toggle=""yes"">CLN2</italic><sup><italic toggle=""yes"">R208X/R208X</italic></sup> miniswine mimics that reported in a previous human study of CLN2 disease<sup><xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR10"">10</xref></sup>. The slight change in WT ventricular volume is similar to patient studies assessing lateral ventricle volume trajectories in non-diseased subjects<sup><xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR60"">60</xref></sup>. This study includes some limitations. The research cost associated with large animal studies is higher than that of small animal studies or human studies utilizing clinically acquired medical imaging data, due to the animal purchase cost, housing per-diems, and expense of time on research-dedicated MRI systems. Due to cost-related restrictions the cohort selection for <italic toggle=""yes"">CLN2</italic><sup><italic toggle=""yes"">R208X/R208X</italic></sup> and WT miniswine was limited to female animals only as uncastrated male miniswine present additional challenges for longitudinal imaging and housing. Additionally, to maximize the number of <italic toggle=""yes"">CLN2</italic><sup><italic toggle=""yes"">R208X/R208X</italic></sup> miniswine in the study, the WT cohort was smaller. There was more variability in the WT raw and ICV proportional ventricle volume compared to the <italic toggle=""yes"">CLN2</italic><sup><italic toggle=""yes"">R208X/R208X</italic></sup> cohort, and two WT miniswine had much larger ventricular volumes compared to the other three. The WT cohort pedigree was examined and no parental/genealogical pattern for the phenotype was found. We found no meaningful measurement difference in the ICV proportional ventricle volumes between the WT and <italic toggle=""yes"">CLN2</italic><sup><italic toggle=""yes"">R208X/R208X</italic></sup> cohort but due to the diversity in WT volumes, further study of the ventricles in a larger, future cohort will be required. This dataset provides a valuable resource for future analysis. In this study diffusion weighted image data were collected but not analyzed due to significant artifact, however, future efforts in post-acquisition artifact correction could permit investigation of this additional data. Recent work by Norris et al., has generated an MRI brain template for male Yucatan miniswine<sup><xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR61"">61</xref></sup>. The dataset and segmentations produced in our study could be used in the future to optimize parameterization and validate precision of the atlas for segmentation. In addition, post validation the atlas may be used to expand the brain segmentation regions for assessment in this female CLN2/WT cohort. The purpose of our study was to examine brain volumetry at early (12-months) and late (17-months) stages of disease development in <italic toggle=""yes"">CLN2</italic><sup><italic toggle=""yes"">R208X/R208X</italic></sup> miniswine and illustrate notable differences compared to that of wild type miniswine. We found valuable early disease MRI biomarkers in the ICV, GM, caudate and putamen (all reduced), along with the CSF (increased) in <italic toggle=""yes"">CLN2</italic><sup><italic toggle=""yes"">R208X/R208X</italic></sup> compared to WT. For tracking progressive disease, GM and CSF differences continued to become more pronounced over time. We found supporting evidence from the literature that the miniswine findings recapitulated observations in patients with CLN2 disease, thus supporting the utilization of MRI brain volumetry in <italic toggle=""yes"">CLN2</italic><sup><italic toggle=""yes"">R208X/R208X</italic></sup> miniswine as a valuable pre-clinical tool set for exploring disease etiology and treatment development.

The Batten disease protein CLN3 is important for stress granules dynamics and translational activity,"The assembly of membrane-less organelles such as stress granules (SGs) is emerging as central in helping cells rapidly respond and adapt to stress. Following stress sensing, the resulting global translational shutoff leads to the condensation of stalled mRNAs and proteins into SGs. By reorganizing cytoplasmic contents, SGs can modulate RNA translation, biochemical reactions, and signaling cascades to promote survival until the stress is resolved. While mechanisms for SG disassembly are not widely understood, the resolution of SGs is important for maintaining cell viability and protein homeostasis. Mutations that lead to persistent or aberrant SGs are increasingly associated with neuropathology and a hallmark of several neurodegenerative diseases. Mutations in <italic toggle=""yes"">CLN3</italic> are causative of juvenile neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis, a rare neurodegenerative disease affecting children also known as Batten disease. <italic toggle=""yes"">CLN3</italic> encodes a transmembrane lysosomal protein implicated in autophagy, endosomal trafficking, metabolism, and response to oxidative stress. Using a HeLa cell model lacking CLN3, we now show that CLN<italic toggle=""yes"">3</italic><sup>KO</sup> is associated with an altered metabolic profile, reduced global translation, and altered stress signaling. Furthermore, loss of CLN3 function results in perturbations in SG dynamics, resulting in assembly and disassembly defects, and altered expression of the key SG nucleating factor G3BP1. With a growing interest in SG-modulating drugs for the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases, novel insights into the molecular basis of CLN3 Batten disease may reveal avenues for disease-modifying treatments for this debilitating childhood disease."," CLN3 disease displays multifactorial pathologies similar to those seen in age-associated neurodegenerative conditions, including metabolic and calcium signaling abnormalities (<xref rid=""bib59"" ref-type=""bibr"">59</xref>), elevated reactive oxygen species (<xref rid=""bib21"" ref-type=""bibr"">21</xref>), defective intracellular trafficking (<xref rid=""bib17"" ref-type=""bibr"">17</xref>, <xref rid=""bib43"" ref-type=""bibr"">43</xref>, <xref rid=""bib60"" ref-type=""bibr"">60</xref>), and autophagy (<xref rid=""bib18"" ref-type=""bibr"">18</xref>). We sought to investigate how loss of CLN3 modulated the SG pathway. We found that cells lacking CLN3 (1) have altered cell metabolism and impaired protein translation, (2) demonstrate delayed SG formation, and (3) display significant delays in SG resolution that are also observed conserved in cells derived from patients with classical juvenile CLN3 disease. We first confirmed that the CLN3<sup>KO</sup> HeLa cell model used in this study displayed features of homeostatic imbalance, by assessing rates of glycolysis and oxidative phosphorylation. These data support that loss of CLN3 lowers the basal rates of both glycolysis and oxidative phosphorylation and impairs the ability of cells to handle additional metabolic stress. Thus, our model recapitulates some of the pathological features associated with CLN3 Batten disease. Furthermore, we detected perturbations in stress signaling pathways that are critical for adaptation to adverse cellular environments. We observed reduced activation of the heat shock protein 27 (HSP27), JNK1/2/3, and p38α. HSP27 plays a role in reducing ROS damage, inhibiting various cell death pathways and promoting protein folding is implicated in neurodegenerative diseases (<xref rid=""bib61"" ref-type=""bibr"">61</xref>). Similarly, mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling pathways, specifically JNK and p38α pathways, are activated by environmental and genotoxic stressors and orchestrate multiple cellular defense mechanisms (<xref rid=""bib62"" ref-type=""bibr"">62</xref>). JNK signaling is implicated in neuronal differentiation, motility, metabolism, and apoptosis, and abnormal signaling is linked to neuronal pathology including ALS and Alzheimer’s disease (<xref rid=""bib63"" ref-type=""bibr"">63</xref>). In addition, previous studies using <italic toggle=""yes"">Drosophila</italic> models have demonstrated a genetic interaction between CLN3 and the JNK signaling pathway (<xref rid=""bib22"" ref-type=""bibr"">22</xref>) and revealed a role for the orthologue Btn1 in response to stress using fission yeast <italic toggle=""yes"">Schizosaccharomyces pombe</italic> (<xref rid=""bib64"" ref-type=""bibr"">64</xref>). Together, our CLN3<sup>KO</sup> HeLa cells display altered homeostasis at basal levels, sensitivity to additional metabolic stress, and altered stress signaling, which supports a role for CLN3 in the cellular stress response. In response to stressful stimuli, SGs sequester nontranslating mRNA, RBPs, and signaling molecules to regulate a network of cellular pathways to regain homeostasis. Given we have observed metabolic, signaling, and proteostasis defects and an increased sensitivity to additional stressors, we probed the ability of CLN3<sup>KO</sup> cells to mount an SG response to exogenous stress caused by sodium arsenite. Surprisingly, this set of experiments revealed that significantly fewer large SGs are present at the later stages of stress induction in CLN3<sup>KO</sup> compared with WT HeLa cells. SG assembly occurs in a step-wise manner when translation initiation is stalled. First, nontranslating mRNP complexes oligomerize into stable core structures. Second, cores act as scaffolds for the recruitment of further mRNP complexes that undergo many fleeting and promiscuous interactions with one another resulting in the formation of the outer dynamic shell and phase separation from surrounding cytoplasm. Third, during the latter stages of assembly, small SGs undergo multiple fusion events to form larger, mature SGs that contain multiple cores (<xref rid=""bib65"" ref-type=""bibr"">65</xref>). The reduction in large SGs observed during the later stages of assembly may be due to impairments in the fusion of small SGs that form early in the stress response. Small assemblies can be directly or indirectly transported along microtubules during cell transport. Studies have shown that stress-induced RNA granules can be tethered to motile lysosomes for long distance travel (<xref rid=""bib66"" ref-type=""bibr"">66</xref>). One possibility is that defective lysosome function and localization (<xref rid=""bib12"" ref-type=""bibr"">12</xref>) in CLN3 disease impairs lysosome motility, which directly effects the ability of RNA granule to “hitchhike” during cell transport, in turn preventing fusion events that lead to granule maturation. Future experiments should aim to further investigate this interaction between SG dynamics and lysosomes. To further probe the molecular mechanism that could explain the defect in SG assembly, we assessed the levels of several SG markers in CLN3 <sup>KO</sup> cells. This revealed that the key SG nucleating factor G3BP1 was downregulated by 2-fold at the mRNA level in CLN3<sup>KO</sup> cells, while other transcripts encoding proteins important within the SG core were unaffected. G3BP1 encodes a multifunctional RBP that interacts with multiple cell pathways including stress response and RNA metabolism, suggesting its importance for maintaining homeostasis (<xref rid=""bib67"" ref-type=""bibr"">67</xref>). In SG formation, G3BP1 is thought to be a critical regulator of LLPS due to its high valency for RNA binding and therefore reduced G3BP1 amounts could contribute to defects in the SG dynamics associated with loss of CLN3 (<xref rid=""bib27"" ref-type=""bibr"">27</xref>). SG dynamics is influenced by a tightly regulated network of protein quality control (PQC) pathways that maintain protein homeostasis by promoting the timely disassembly of SGs after stress. Recent work on SG disassembly has shown it is a highly context-specific process, with stressor type and duration influencing the mechanism of clearance (<xref rid=""bib68"" ref-type=""bibr"">68</xref>, <xref rid=""bib69"" ref-type=""bibr"">69</xref>). Failure of PQC pathways is associated with aging and disease and leads to persistent SGs, a putative cause of neurodegeneration (<xref rid=""bib70"" ref-type=""bibr"">70</xref>). Our data showed an increased persistence of small and medium SGs after stress release associated with CLN3<sup>KO</sup> cells, which could not simply be explained by prolonged eIF2α activation. Interestingly, these defects in SG clearance are specific to SG induced by eIF2α-dependent pathways, which may reflect the stress-specific nature of SGs, proposed to be compositionally and structurally heterogeneous depending on the stress (<xref rid=""bib70"" ref-type=""bibr"">70</xref>). In addition, during recovery from stress, SGs control the hyperassembly of the nuclear biocondensate paraspeckles, which are important for RNA splicing. In consequence, we observed reduced hyperassembly of paraspeckles in CLN3<sup>KO</sup> cells reflecting the broad impact of CLN3 on cytoplasmic and nuclear biocondensates. SG integrity is also maintained by a network of molecular chaperones that prevent protein misfolding within the granule and aid the recruitment of other essential SG factors. Heat shock protein 90 (HSP90) is a major chaperone implicated in SG dissolution and stress adaptation. By modulating the activity of dual-specificity tyrosine-phosphorylation-regulated kinase 3 (DYRK3), HSP90 couples SG dissolution with the release of mTORC1 and reinitiation of metabolism. Reduced activity and expression of DYRK3 is seen in ALS and is causative of SG clearance defects and decreased viability (<xref rid=""bib51"" ref-type=""bibr"">51</xref>). Although we observed an increase in expression of HSP90 subunits during the 3-h recovery phase, there was no difference in the change of expression between WT and CLN3<sup>KO</sup> cells, suggesting that, in our model, HSP90 modulation of DYRK3 is intact and any impairment in SG clearance is not due to inactivation of DYRK3. Recent work has shed light on the role of PTMs in condensate assembly (<xref rid=""bib27"" ref-type=""bibr"">27</xref>, <xref rid=""bib71"" ref-type=""bibr"">71</xref>). In particular, for the key SG node G3BP1, phosphorylation at residues S149 and S232 flanking its acidic intrinsically disordered region has been proposed to increase the threshold for phase separation likely keeping G3BP1 in an SG-incompetent conformation (<xref rid=""bib26"" ref-type=""bibr"">26</xref>, <xref rid=""bib27"" ref-type=""bibr"">27</xref>). In addition, the G3BP1 RGG domain is the target of differential arginine methylation by the protein arginine methyltransferases PRMT1 and PRMT5, with methylation at residues R435, R447, and R460 strongly inhibiting SG formation, while loss of PRMT1 and PRMT5 activity is associated with a small SG phenotype (<xref rid=""bib55"" ref-type=""bibr"">55</xref>). Together, PTMs of G3BP1 represent a way of fine-tuning SG assembly, and future studies should investigate whether loss or overexpression of CLN3 has any effect on these. The equilibrium of cellular protein levels (termed proteostasis) is maintained by a network of interactions between numerous biochemical pathways. Protein synthesis, folding, PTM, and degradation are highly regulated to ensure the functional requirement of cells are met while ensuring PQC and degradation pathways are not overwhelmed (<xref rid=""bib72"" ref-type=""bibr"">72</xref>, <xref rid=""bib73"" ref-type=""bibr"">73</xref>). Exposure to stress can perturb the delicate balance of interactions that maintain proteostasis, which may subsequently lead to pathological compensatory changes. Equally, reduced efficiency of degradation pathways by disease-associated mutations or aging can result in the accumulation of toxic protein aggregates (<xref rid=""bib74"" ref-type=""bibr"">74</xref>). Measuring translation at single cell level, combined with polysomes profiling, we observed a significantly reduced rate of translation under basal conditions in CLN3<sup>KO</sup> cells, a reduced association of mRNAs with highly translating ribosomes, and a reduced polysome:monosome ratio in CLN3<sup>KO</sup> cells. Overall, this suggests there are fewer mRNA-bound ribosomes in steady-state conditions and impaired translational activity associated with loss of CLN3. Recent work in the fission yeast model has shown a genetic interaction between the CLN3 orthologue, <italic toggle=""yes"">btn1</italic>, and genes encoding ribosomal proteins suggesting a link between CLN3 function and protein synthesis (<xref rid=""bib75"" ref-type=""bibr"">75</xref>). Work in the same HeLa KO system used in this study has also shown CLN3<sup>KO</sup> impairs the late stages of autophagy (<xref rid=""bib17"" ref-type=""bibr"">17</xref>, <xref rid=""bib18"" ref-type=""bibr"">18</xref>). Autophagy is one of the major catabolic routes of protein degradation and essential for cell viability. Impairment in the clearance of proteins disturbs the balance of protein homeostasis, and cells may establish compensatory mechanisms to restore equilibrium. It is plausible that, in CLN3<sup>KO</sup> cells, global translation is reduced to lessen the burden on a deficient autophagy pathway. Data from the literature further support this, as previous work has shown a direct and functional interaction between CLN3 and Rab7a, a small GTPase implicated in the function of late endosomes (<xref rid=""bib17"" ref-type=""bibr"">17</xref>). Late endosomal Rab7a has been shown to bear mRNA that is translated by associated ribosomes and translational machinery. These complexes of endosomes and RNP granules dock onto mitochondria and translate mRNA essential for mitochondrial vitality (<xref rid=""bib76"" ref-type=""bibr"">76</xref>). Mutations causing CLN3 disease disturb the distribution of late endosomal and lysosomal compartments resulting in perinuclear clustering and impaired motility (<xref rid=""bib12"" ref-type=""bibr"">12</xref>). We suggest that the physical interaction between late endosome/lysosome and translating RNP granules may be impaired in CLN3<sup>KO</sup> cells. Furthermore, decreased site-specific translation of mitochondrial proteins, which is dependent on this interaction, might contribute to impaired mitochondrial activity. Together, these data suggest that the requirement for CLN3 in translation is conserved between yeast and mammalian cells. It remains unanswered what mRNAs are being translationally repressed, whether it is a global phenomenon or specific to certain populations of transcripts. Future work expanding on the polysome fractionation performed in this study may shed light on this question and unravel the deregulated pathways that contribute toward CLN3 disease pathogenesis. This study has shown for the first time a potential interaction between CLN3 pathology and SG assembly, disassembly, and the regulation of steady-state translation. Given the role of SGs in the reorganization of cellular contents to maintain homeostasis in steady-state conditions and in response to stressful stimuli, and recent work highlighting the importance of lysosomes in SG shuttling in neurons to avoid neurodegeneration, our study paves the way for further investigation in patient-derived cells to explore the link between lysosomes, SG dynamics, and modulation in CLN3 disease.

Recently, a clinical trial has emerged to test the delivery of gene therapy for the treatment of CLN7 Batten disease (NCT04737460). The CLN7 form of Batten disease is caused by more than thirty-five mutations in the major facilitator superfamily domain containing 8 (<italic toggle=""yes"">MFSD8</italic>) gene, leading to protein reduction, or an inactive form of the CLN7 protein.<xref rid=""bib15"" ref-type=""bibr""><sup>15</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid=""bib16"" ref-type=""bibr""><sup>16</sup></xref> Clinical signs of disease present during the late-infantile stage, with most patients dying in late childhood to teenaged years.<xref rid=""bib17"" ref-type=""bibr""><sup>17</sup></xref> In addition, some compound heterozygous patients have been identified with late-onset disease characterized by retinal dystrophies, including non-syndromic macular dystrophies with central cone involvement.<xref rid=""bib7"" ref-type=""bibr""><sup>7</sup></xref> Although this new gene therapy approach shows promise, it is not expected to pass the blood-retina barrier to efficiently prevent retinal degeneration in these CLN7 patients. Studies are needed that examine the efficiency and efficacy of this gene therapy vector, or other potential therapeutic approaches, on retinal degeneration for CLN7 Batten disease. In order to examine the therapeutic efficiency and efficacy, there need to be phenotypic outcomes that can be monitored with and without treatment. Thus, an understanding of the natural progression of retinal degeneration in these patients is necessary. In this study, we performed visual examinations and clinical imaging on five patients with CLN7 Batten disease. We found that patients were far progressed in retinal degeneration within their first five years of life. Therefore, we utilized a preclinical model of CLN7 Batten disease and characterized the long-term progression of retinal degeneration. Along with the rod degeneration detectable early in disease that replicated the histological findings previously published,<xref rid=""bib18"" ref-type=""bibr""><sup>18</sup></xref> we found a possible defect in photoreceptor to bipolar cell synaptic connectivity, early loss of both rod and cone function, and a loss of the inner nuclear layer (INL) at late stages of disease. The ability to follow the degeneration using clinical imaging in this preclinical model provides testing outcomes that can be used to monitor the potential efficacy of therapeutic approaches to treat retinal degeneration caused by CLN7 Batten disease.   Batten disease is a fast-progressing, paediatric condition characterized by impaired vision, seizures, loss of motor control and premature death.<xref rid=""bib1"" ref-type=""bibr""><sup>1</sup></xref> The ability to use gene therapy advances to treat patients is promising. However, there remains a need to understand the natural progression of retinal degeneration in these patients in order to define clinical therapeutic outcomes and efficacy to treat vision loss.

Although this is a cohort with a small sample size, data obtained showed that these patients were far progressed in retinal degeneration within their first five years of life. This is expected to represent the general population of CLN7 patients, as the disease presents within the late-infantile age with an early retinal degenerative phenotype. We did find that the youngest patient displayed an electronegative ERG with reduced, but present, a-waves OU. This indicates the possibility of an early photoreceptor to bipolar synaptic defect. However, there was no ERG data collected at this earlier age for the other four patients, and it may be an outcome specific to this single case, and not CLN7 Batten disease patients as a whole. Other mammalian models for the study of NCLs have provided insight into the mechanisms underlying retinal degeneration.<xref rid=""bib37"" ref-type=""bibr"">37</xref>, <xref rid=""bib38"" ref-type=""bibr"">38</xref>, <xref rid=""bib39"" ref-type=""bibr"">39</xref>, <xref rid=""bib40"" ref-type=""bibr"">40</xref>, <xref rid=""bib41"" ref-type=""bibr"">41</xref> For instance, the retinal degeneration noted in the <italic toggle=""yes"">Cln3</italic><sup><italic toggle=""yes"">Δex7/8</italic></sup> mouse model for CLN3 Batten disease displays a loss of the bipolar cells, and this can be rescued using gene therapy approaches targeting the bipolar cells.<xref rid=""bib42"" ref-type=""bibr""><sup>42</sup></xref> Surprisingly, in the <italic toggle=""yes"">Cln6</italic><sup><italic toggle=""yes"">nclf</italic></sup> mouse model of CLN6 Batten disease, the main retinal cell loss is in the photoreceptors, similar to that shown in the CLN7 mouse model.<xref rid=""bib38"" ref-type=""bibr""><sup>38</sup></xref> However, gene therapy vectors targeting the photoreceptor cells were unable to delay retinal degeneration in the <italic toggle=""yes"">Cln6</italic><sup><italic toggle=""yes"">nclf</italic></sup> mouse, but vectors that targeted the bipolar cells delayed photoreceptor degeneration.<xref rid=""bib43"" ref-type=""bibr""><sup>43</sup></xref> This indicates a possible critical role for the bipolar cells in preserving retinal function in Batten disease. To further investigate the progression of retinal degeneration during CLN7 Batten disease, we utilized the <italic toggle=""yes"">Cln7</italic> KO mouse model.<xref rid=""bib19"" ref-type=""bibr""><sup>19</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid=""bib20"" ref-type=""bibr""><sup>20</sup></xref> This model has its limitations as the neurological deficits arise much later than seen in human patients.<xref rid=""bib19"" ref-type=""bibr""><sup>19</sup></xref> However, retinal degeneration was noted in this preclinical model before one month of age, similar to human patients.

This ability to monitor both rod and cone survival and function over time provides a baseline for testing the efficacy of potential clinical therapeutics on the photoreceptor cells and visual preservation. Furthermore, human CLN7 Batten disease patients show a loss of the bipolar cells of the inner nuclear layer (INL), which has not been previously detected in the <italic toggle=""yes"">Cln7</italic> KO mouse.<xref rid=""bib18"" ref-type=""bibr""><sup>18</sup></xref> In our study, we detected a significant loss of the INL on histological analysis at six months of age, and found that beginning at four months of age there was a significant and progressive decline in the oscillatory potentials. These indicate signalling loss in the inhibitory amacrine and bipolar cells. Immunostaining analysis showed a possible reduction in VGLUT1 in the outer plexiform layer (OPL) at two months of age, suggestive of a defect in photoreceptor to bipolar synaptic signalling. Protein analysis of VGLUT1 did not show a reduction in the <italic toggle=""yes"">Cln7</italic> KO mice at five months of age, but this may be due to the fact that it detected both VGLUT1 in the IPL and OPL, and the change visible on immunostaining in the OPL was not drastic enough to detect with Western blot of whole retinas. There was a similar trend for the bipolar cells, where a reduction was visible by immunostaining at five months of age in the <italic toggle=""yes"">Cln7</italic> KO mice, but this was significant on Western blot analysis only between early- and late-stage <italic toggle=""yes"">Cln7</italic> KO mice, and not when compared to wild-type controls. We did find variability in the rate of degeneration within <italic toggle=""yes"">Cln7</italic> KO mice over time, with some progressing to a significant loss of the ONL and INL by five months of age, while others required six months or longer to show a significant reduction in the INL. In our study, we examined single dependent variables (i.e. scotopic visual response, outer nuclear layer thickness, etc.). There is a potential for confounding variables to play a role on the variables examined in this study. For instance, the cage location within the animal facility where the mice are housed as well as the nesting and social arrangement of the mice within a single cage can impact the light exposure to a given mouse, possibly affecting the rate of retinal degeneration. Additionally, the precise time of day for experimental methods, such as ERG, can play a role in the electrical response obtained. To reduce the likelihood of these confounding factors, we housed our mice in the same row and rack of the same animal facility room, as well as performed ERGs on controls and experimental littermates on the same day and same window of time (morning or afternoon). All of this data opens up the possibility that early in CLN7 Batten disease, defects arise in the synaptic connections to the bipolar cells. These would likely occur prior to the onset of rod and cone functional loss, followed by rod degeneration and secondary death of the cones with a late-onset degeneration of the INL, likely the bipolar cells. As mentioned, recent gene therapy approaches in a preclinical model of CLN6 Batten disease - also caused by a loss of the rod photoreceptors - determined that targeting the bipolar cells was necessary for therapeutic efficacy.<xref rid=""bib7"" ref-type=""bibr""><sup>7</sup></xref> Future studies are needed to test gene therapy vectors targeted specifically to either photoreceptor or bipolar cells using this <italic toggle=""yes"">Cln7</italic> KO mouse model.

We find that care should be taken in treatment of human CLN7 Batten disease patients when prescribing drugs or considering anaesthetic options and routes of delivery. Additionally, lysosomal function is known to be important in controlling autophagy pathways in the retina and has implications in the progression of age-related macular degeneration (AMD).<xref rid=""bib47"" ref-type=""bibr""><sup>47</sup></xref> Some compound heterozygous CLN7 Batten disease patients present with non-syndromic retinal dystrophies, with the most common presentation that of macular dystrophy with central cone involvement.<xref rid=""bib7"" ref-type=""bibr""><sup>7</sup></xref> We found that our <italic toggle=""yes"">Cln7</italic> KO mouse model has an early loss of cone function, supporting its involvement in macular dystrophy.

We therefore hypothesized that TPC2 activation may modulate lysosomal Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling to rescue LSD phenotypes, particularly in LSDs where TRPML1 is impacted. In our study, we focused on MLIV and NPC1 on the one hand, LSDs that both have been shown before to be connected to disrupted lysosomal Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling and TRPML1 dysfunction (Shen <italic toggle=""yes"">et al</italic>, <xref rid=""emmm202115377-bib-0062"" ref-type=""bibr"">2012</xref>). On the other hand, we focused on juvenile neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis (JNCL) or Batten disease, caused by mutations in CLN3, an LSD which shows prominent retinal and neurodegenerative phenotypes with gradual vision loss and progressive cognitive decline as observed in MLIV, and with a similar age‐dependent disease onset and evidence for disturbed lysosomal Ca<sup>2+</sup> homeostasis (Chandrachud <italic toggle=""yes"">et al</italic>, <xref rid=""emmm202115377-bib-0009"" ref-type=""bibr"">2015</xref>). By analyzing disease hallmarks in patient fibroblasts, novel CRISPR/Cas9‐engineered iPSCs/iPSC‐derived neurons, and the MLIV mouse upon treatment with a TPC2 small molecule agonist, TPC2‐A1‐P, we demonstrate that TPC2 activation ameliorates the phenotypes of these LSDs both <italic toggle=""yes"">in vitro</italic> and <italic toggle=""yes"">in vivo</italic>.  Boosting lysosomal trafficking, autophagy, and exocytosis shows a promising therapeutic strategy to improve lysosomal function in several diseases (Medina <italic toggle=""yes"">et al</italic>, <xref rid=""emmm202115377-bib-0043"" ref-type=""bibr"">2011</xref>; Bae <italic toggle=""yes"">et al</italic>, <xref rid=""emmm202115377-bib-0001"" ref-type=""bibr"">2014</xref>; Grimm <italic toggle=""yes"">et al</italic>, <xref rid=""emmm202115377-bib-0031"" ref-type=""bibr"">2014</xref>; Medina <italic toggle=""yes"">et al</italic>, <xref rid=""emmm202115377-bib-0044"" ref-type=""bibr"">2015</xref>; García‐Rúa <italic toggle=""yes"">et al</italic>, <xref rid=""emmm202115377-bib-0026"" ref-type=""bibr"">2016</xref>; Zhong <italic toggle=""yes"">et al</italic>, <xref rid=""emmm202115377-bib-0079"" ref-type=""bibr"">2016</xref>; Grimm <italic toggle=""yes"">et al</italic>, <xref rid=""emmm202115377-bib-0032"" ref-type=""bibr"">2017</xref>; Bonam <italic toggle=""yes"">et al</italic>, <xref rid=""emmm202115377-bib-0003"" ref-type=""bibr"">2019</xref>; Tsunemi <italic toggle=""yes"">et al</italic>, <xref rid=""emmm202115377-bib-0065"" ref-type=""bibr"">2019</xref>). Here, we assessed the effect of TPC2 activation on LSD phenotypes in human fibroblasts and isogenic iPSC‐based neuronal models. We show that TPC2 activation with TPC2‐A1‐P rescues storage phenotypes in MLIV, NPC1, and JNCL cells. Our <italic toggle=""yes"">in vivo</italic> results further indicate that TPC2‐A1‐P restores central nervous system defects, including astrogliosis and accumulation of P62/SQSTM1 inclusions in MLIV mice (Folkerth <italic toggle=""yes"">et al</italic>, <xref rid=""emmm202115377-bib-0023"" ref-type=""bibr"">1995</xref>; Grishchuk <italic toggle=""yes"">et al</italic>, <xref rid=""emmm202115377-bib-0033"" ref-type=""bibr"">2014</xref>; DeRosa <italic toggle=""yes"">et al</italic>, <xref rid=""emmm202115377-bib-0019"" ref-type=""bibr"">2021</xref>), as well as improves their motor performance (rotarod). Endolysosomes depend on the activity of their channels and transporters, dysfunction of which often severely affects organelle function and underlies neurodegenerative disease pathology. TRPML1 and TPC2 are the primary lysosomal Ca<sup>2+</sup> release channels, mediating the Ca<sup>2+</sup> efflux that so often is impaired in neurodegeneration (e.g., NPC1, MLIV, Fabry, and Alzheimer's disease (Feng & Yang, <xref rid=""emmm202115377-bib-0022"" ref-type=""bibr"">2016</xref>)). TRPML1 function is directly affected in MLIV (Chen <italic toggle=""yes"">et al</italic>, <xref rid=""emmm202115377-bib-0011"" ref-type=""bibr"">2014</xref>), while in NPC1 and other LSDs, TRPML1 activity is reduced, e.g., by accumulating sphingomyelin (Shen <italic toggle=""yes"">et al</italic>, <xref rid=""emmm202115377-bib-0062"" ref-type=""bibr"">2012</xref>). In addition, lysosomal pH is often increased in LSDs, affecting the activity of not only many lysosomal enzymes but also TRPML1 (Dong <italic toggle=""yes"">et al</italic>, <xref rid=""emmm202115377-bib-0020"" ref-type=""bibr"">2010</xref>). While TRPML1 activity is pH dependent, decreasing with increasing pH, TPC2 activation by PI(3,5)P<sub>2</sub> is pH independent (Wang <italic toggle=""yes"">et al</italic>, <xref rid=""emmm202115377-bib-0071"" ref-type=""bibr"">2012</xref>), which may be an advantage when targeting TPC2. Our results provide an incentive to further investigate the potential benefit of TPC2 activation in various LSDs. Besides LSDs, TRPML1/TPC2 activation may also have relevance for adult‐onset neurodegenerative disease therapy. Indeed, stimulation of lysosomal exocytosis via TRPML1 has recently been shown to clear α‐synuclein accumulation in Parkinson's disease dopaminergic neurons (Tsunemi <italic toggle=""yes"">et al</italic>, <xref rid=""emmm202115377-bib-0065"" ref-type=""bibr"">2019</xref>), while another study demonstrated that activation of TRPML1 cleared amyloid‐beta (Aβ), which accumulates by unknown mechanisms in the lysosomal and autophagic compartments of neurons in the HIV‐infected brain (Bae <italic toggle=""yes"">et al</italic>, <xref rid=""emmm202115377-bib-0001"" ref-type=""bibr"">2014</xref>). These examples encourage further investigation of targeting TRPML1/TPC2 also in adult‐onset neurodegenerative disease therapy.

"Transmembrane Batten Disease Proteins Interact With a Shared Network of Vesicle Sorting Proteins, Impacting Their Synaptic Enrichment","Batten disease is unique among lysosomal storage disorders for the early and profound manifestation in the central nervous system, but little is known regarding potential neuron-specific roles for the disease-associated proteins. We demonstrate substantial overlap in the protein interactomes of three transmembrane Batten proteins (CLN3, CLN6, and CLN8), and that their absence leads to synaptic depletion of key partners (i.e., SNAREs and tethers) and altered synaptic SNARE complexing <italic toggle=""yes"">in vivo</italic>, demonstrating a novel shared etiology.","Batten disease (also known as Neuronal Ceroid Lipofuscinoses, NCL) is a family of neurodegenerative lysosomal storage disorders caused by mutations in one of at least 13 Ceroid Lipofuscinosis Neuronal (CLN) genes (Johnson et al., <xref rid=""B11"" ref-type=""bibr"">2019</xref>). Batten disease is unique among lysosomal storage disorders for the early and profound disease manifestation in the central nervous system, which has frequently been attributed (with little evidence) to a selective vulnerability of neurons to downstream consequences of lysosomal dysfunction. However, while some forms of Batten disease are caused by mutations in genes encoding for lysosomal machinery including catabolic enzymes, other forms are caused by deficiencies in extralysosomal proteins, suggesting that lysosomal dysfunction could be just one consequence of upstream primary defects that are not entirely understood. To gain insights into upstream neuronal functions, we investigated the protein interactomes of three transmembrane Batten disease proteins: CLN3, CLN6, and CLN8. Decades of research have uncovered a range of secondary dysfunctions present in cell models of these three disorders, and recent studies in non-neuronal cell models have shed light on their participation in pathways important for lysosomal biogenesis. CLN3 influences the recycling of lysosomal cargo receptors by regulating retromer recruitment and post-Golgi trafficking (Metcalf et al., <xref rid=""B12"" ref-type=""bibr"">2008</xref>; Yasa et al., <xref rid=""B18"" ref-type=""bibr"">2020</xref>, <xref rid=""B19"" ref-type=""bibr"">2021</xref>), and CLN6 and CLN8 cooperatively facilitate the anterograde trafficking of lysosomal cargoes (di Ronza et al., <xref rid=""B7"" ref-type=""bibr"">2018</xref>; Bajaj et al., <xref rid=""B3"" ref-type=""bibr"">2020</xref>). However, reliance on non-neuronal cell models has created potential knowledge gaps in our understanding of neuronal etiology. Synaptic dysfunction precedes lysosomal defects and responds differentially to therapies in some <italic toggle=""yes"">in vivo</italic> models of these disorders (Ahrens-Nicklas et al., <xref rid=""B1"" ref-type=""bibr"">2019</xref>, <xref rid=""B2"" ref-type=""bibr"">2021</xref>; Gomez-Giro, <xref rid=""B8"" ref-type=""bibr"">2019</xref>), and little is known regarding how these synaptic deficits manifest. Given the phenotypic, pathological, and cell biological similarities between CLN3, CLN6, and CLN8 Batten disease, and their overlapping expression patterns in cortical neurons (<xref rid=""F1"" ref-type=""fig"">Figure 1A</xref>), we hypothesized that the three proteins may participate in shared pathways essential for neuronal function. We performed proximity-dependent biotin identification (BioID) screens for each of the three proteins in neuroblastoma cells to elucidate their protein interactomes in a neuron-like cell line (<xref rid=""SM1"" ref-type=""supplementary-material"">Supplementary Figure 1</xref>). This identified a large number of enriched proteins in CLN3 (832), CLN6 (515), and CLN8 (1678) samples. Remarkably, there was a substantial degree of overlap between the three groups, with a core set of 263 shared proteins (<xref rid=""F1"" ref-type=""fig"">Figure 1B</xref>). Within this shared interactome, pathway analysis demonstrated enrichment for proteins involved in vesicle identity, fusion, and composition [i.e., soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor attachment protein receptor (SNAREs), tethers, and adapter proteins; <xref rid=""F1"" ref-type=""fig"">Figures 1C,D</xref>], as well as proteins essential for synaptic vesicle function (<xref rid=""F1"" ref-type=""fig"">Figure 1E</xref>). We confirmed a number of these interactions with co-immunoprecipitation using neuroblastoma cells and mouse cortical lysates, validating the specificity of our BioID screen (<xref rid=""F2"" ref-type=""fig"">Figures 2A–C</xref>; <xref rid=""SM1"" ref-type=""supplementary-material"">Supplementary Table 1</xref>). While these shared interactions may be due to interactions between CLN3, CLN6, and CLN8, there was no enrichment between these proteins based on our BioID screens. To investigate the functional relevance of the shared interactions captured in our screen, we examined the subcellular localization of a subset of proteins with roles in vesicle fusion and presynaptic function. Fresh brain cortices were micro-dissected from postnatal day 30 wild type, <italic toggle=""yes"">Cln3</italic><sup>Δ<italic toggle=""yes"">ex</italic>7/8</sup>, <italic toggle=""yes"">Cln6</italic><sup><italic toggle=""yes"">nclf</italic></sup>, and <italic toggle=""yes"">Cln8</italic><sup><italic toggle=""yes"">mnd</italic></sup> mice [loss of function models for Batten disease (Bronson et al., <xref rid=""B5"" ref-type=""bibr"">1993</xref>; Cotman et al., <xref rid=""B6"" ref-type=""bibr"">2002</xref>; Morgan et al., <xref rid=""B13"" ref-type=""bibr"">2013</xref>)], followed by synaptic and cytosolic isolation by density separation (<xref rid=""SM1"" ref-type=""supplementary-material"">Supplementary Figure 2F</xref>). This revealed striking defects in synaptic composition across all three genotypes (<xref rid=""F2"" ref-type=""fig"">Figures 2D–F</xref>; <xref rid=""SM1"" ref-type=""supplementary-material"">Supplementary Figures 2A–E</xref>; <xref rid=""SM1"" ref-type=""supplementary-material"">Supplementary Table 2</xref>). Some targets displayed decreased synaptic abundance in all three genotypes, including ATPase H+ Transporting V1 Subunit H [ATP6V1H, a component of the vacuolar ATPase complex that acidifies lysosomes and synaptic vesicles, facilitating neurotransmitter loading and SNARE-mediated exoctytosis (Hiesinger et al., <xref rid=""B10"" ref-type=""bibr"">2005</xref>; Poëa-Guyon et al., <xref rid=""B15"" ref-type=""bibr"">2013</xref>; Bodzeta et al., <xref rid=""B4"" ref-type=""bibr"">2017</xref>); <xref rid=""F2"" ref-type=""fig"">Figure 2E</xref>], and Synaptobrevin homolog YKT6 [YKT6, a neuron-enriched SNARE protein localized to a novel vesicular compartment (Hasegawa et al., <xref rid=""B9"" ref-type=""bibr"">2003</xref>), <xref rid=""F2"" ref-type=""fig"">Figure 2F</xref>], while other targets displayed genotype-specific patterns of depletion, including Syntaxin 7 [STX7, an endosomal Q-SNARE that defines a specialized synaptic vesicle pool in hippocampal neurons (Mori et al., <xref rid=""B14"" ref-type=""bibr"">2021</xref>), <xref rid=""SM1"" ref-type=""supplementary-material"">Supplementary Figures 2A,E</xref>] and ATPase H+ Transporting V0 subunit D1 (ATP6V0D1, another component of the vacuolar ATPase that acidifies lysosomes and synaptic vesicles <xref rid=""SM1"" ref-type=""supplementary-material"">Supplementary Figures 2C,E</xref>) in <italic toggle=""yes"">Cln3</italic><sup>Δ<italic toggle=""yes"">ex</italic>7/8</sup>, and mammalian uncoordinated-18 [MUNC18, an essential component of the synaptic vesicle SNARE complex (Verhage et al., <xref rid=""B17"" ref-type=""bibr"">2000</xref>), <xref rid=""SM1"" ref-type=""supplementary-material"">Supplementary Figures 2D,E</xref>] in <italic toggle=""yes"">Cln6</italic><sup><italic toggle=""yes"">nclf</italic></sup>. In many cases, synaptic depletion was accompanied by cytosolic enrichment, suggesting defects in soma to synaptic terminal sorting or trafficking. Synaptic terminal composition is tightly regulated and altered stoichiometry of key partners could lead to impaired function. To investigate this possibility, we examined the synaptic vesicle SNARE association state in our disease models. When functioning properly, synaptic vesicles dock and fuse <italic toggle=""yes"">via</italic> engagement between vesicular SNAREs on synaptic vesicles (e.g., Synaptobrevin 2, VAMP2) and target snares on the plasma membrane (e.g., Syntaxins 1A and/or 1B, STX1A/STX1B; Synaptosome associated protein 25, SNAP-25). Following neurotransmitter exocytosis, the vesicle fusing ATPase (NSF) dissociates the SNARE complex allowing for vesicle recycling and further rounds of loading and release. Thus, physical associations between these SNARE components can be used to monitor the extent of docking and fusion of synaptic vesicles (Sharma et al., <xref rid=""B16"" ref-type=""bibr"">2011</xref>). We performed SNAP25 coimmunoprecipitations on mouse cortices and quantified levels of bound STX1 and VAMP2, finding prominent aberrations in all three disease models (<xref rid=""F3"" ref-type=""fig"">Figures 3A–C</xref>). Levels of bound STX1 were significantly increased by at least 2-fold in <italic toggle=""yes"">Cln3</italic><sup>Δ<italic toggle=""yes"">ex</italic>7/8</sup>, <italic toggle=""yes"">Cln6</italic><sup><italic toggle=""yes"">nclf</italic></sup>, and <italic toggle=""yes"">Cln8</italic><sup><italic toggle=""yes"">mnd</italic></sup>. VAMP2 trended toward greater levels in <italic toggle=""yes"">Cln3</italic><sup>Δ<italic toggle=""yes"">ex</italic>7/8</sup> and <italic toggle=""yes"">Cln8</italic><sup><italic toggle=""yes"">mnd</italic></sup> but was bound at significantly lower levels in <italic toggle=""yes"">Cln6</italic><sup><italic toggle=""yes"">nclf</italic></sup> cortices. These results suggest synaptic SNARE complex formation or dissociation may be altered in all three of these Batten disease models as a consequence of disrupted abundance in various cellular compartments. Collectively, our results demonstrate a new etiology shared across three neurodegenerative lysosomal storage disorders and demonstrate novel neuron-specific roles for CLN3, CLN6, and CLN8 in the regulation of synaptic composition. The fact that key regulators of vesicle targeting (i.e., SNAREs and tethers) are dysregulated similarly to lysosomal proteins (e.g., vacuolar ATPase subunits), provides an intriguing link between seemingly disparate dysfunctions in synapses and lysosomes. Further work will be required to define the molecular-level causes of these defects and the relative contributions of the various synaptically depleted interacting proteins. This work suggests that these transmembrane Batten proteins interact with a diverse repertoire of proteins important for cellular trafficking and vesicular sorting and supports a multi-faceted disease etiology wherein lysosomal dysfunction is only one salient consequence.

"Towards Understanding Behaviour and Emotions of Children with CLN3 Disease (Batten Disease): Patterns, Problems and Support for Child and Family","The juvenile variant of Neuronal Ceroid Lipofuscinosis (CLN3 disease/Batten disease) is a rare progressive brain disease in children and young adults, characterized by vision loss, decline in cognitive and motor capacities and epilepsy. Children with CLN3 disease often show disturbed behaviour and emotions. The aim of this study is to gain a better understanding of the behaviour and emotions of children with CLN3 disease and to examine the support that the children and their parents are receiving. A combination of qualitative and quantitative analysis was used to analyse patient files and parent interviews. Using a framework analysis approach a codebook was developed, the sources were coded and the data were analysed. The analysis resulted in overviews of (1) typical behaviour and emotions of children as a consequence of CLN3 disease, (2) the support children with CLN3 disease receive, (3) the support parents of these children receive, and (4) the problems these parents face. For a few children their visual, physical or cognitive deterioration was found to lead to specific emotions and behaviour. The quantitative analysis showed that anxiety was reported for all children. The presented overviews on support contain tacit knowledge of health care professionals that has been made explicit by this study. The overviews may provide a lead to adaptable support-modules for children with CLN3 disease and their parents.","CLN3 disease (also known as Batten disease or Neuronal Ceroid Lipofuscinosis (NCL) type 3) is a neurodegenerative disorder of childhood onset. Every year, around 1 per 100,000 children are born with NCL [<xref rid=""B1-ijerph-19-05895"" ref-type=""bibr"">1</xref>], of which type 3 is one of the four primary forms [<xref rid=""B2-ijerph-19-05895"" ref-type=""bibr"">2</xref>], also referred to as the most common type of NCL [<xref rid=""B3-ijerph-19-05895"" ref-type=""bibr"">3</xref>]. In the Netherlands, about 30 children suffer from this disease [<xref rid=""B4-ijerph-19-05895"" ref-type=""bibr"">4</xref>]. CLN3 disease is caused by bi-allelic mutations in the <italic toggle=""yes"">CLN3</italic> gene, encoding CLN3, a presumed lysosomal protein of a yet unknown function [<xref rid=""B5-ijerph-19-05895"" ref-type=""bibr"">5</xref>,<xref rid=""B6-ijerph-19-05895"" ref-type=""bibr"">6</xref>,<xref rid=""B7-ijerph-19-05895"" ref-type=""bibr"">7</xref>,<xref rid=""B8-ijerph-19-05895"" ref-type=""bibr"">8</xref>]. Without proper functioning of CLN3, ceroid lipopigments accumulate in all body cells, predominantly affecting the retina and the brain [<xref rid=""B9-ijerph-19-05895"" ref-type=""bibr"">9</xref>]. CLN3 disease has a progressive course increasingly damaging the nervous system. The typical clinical course of CLN3 disease involves vision loss at an age of 5–7 years [<xref rid=""B5-ijerph-19-05895"" ref-type=""bibr"">5</xref>,<xref rid=""B10-ijerph-19-05895"" ref-type=""bibr"">10</xref>], followed by epileptic seizures, (Parkinson-like) motor decline, (dementia-like) cognitive decline and behavioural disturbances [<xref rid=""B11-ijerph-19-05895"" ref-type=""bibr"">11</xref>,<xref rid=""B12-ijerph-19-05895"" ref-type=""bibr"">12</xref>], although there is variability in the temporal order of symptom onset and rate of disease progression [<xref rid=""B13-ijerph-19-05895"" ref-type=""bibr"">13</xref>]. Adaptive skills and cognitive function are significantly negatively correlated with disease duration [<xref rid=""B10-ijerph-19-05895"" ref-type=""bibr"">10</xref>,<xref rid=""B14-ijerph-19-05895"" ref-type=""bibr"">14</xref>]. Currently, no treatment can cure or slow down the pace of the disease. In CLN3 disease, treatment is symptomatic and supportive [<xref rid=""B15-ijerph-19-05895"" ref-type=""bibr"">15</xref>]. This means that eventually, children with CLN3 disease lose all communication skills and become completely bedridden. Generally, they do not become older than 23 years. Research on behaviour in children with CLN3 disease reports emotional and behavioural problems in 50–75% of the children [<xref rid=""B5-ijerph-19-05895"" ref-type=""bibr"">5</xref>,<xref rid=""B16-ijerph-19-05895"" ref-type=""bibr"">16</xref>,<xref rid=""B17-ijerph-19-05895"" ref-type=""bibr"">17</xref>]. Studies are consistent in the finding that there is a higher level of these problems in this group than in peers with typical development [<xref rid=""B10-ijerph-19-05895"" ref-type=""bibr"">10</xref>,<xref rid=""B16-ijerph-19-05895"" ref-type=""bibr"">16</xref>,<xref rid=""B18-ijerph-19-05895"" ref-type=""bibr"">18</xref>,<xref rid=""B19-ijerph-19-05895"" ref-type=""bibr"">19</xref>]. Abnormalities in emotions and behaviour have an increase in puberty and a decrease during the later years of life. These include behavioural problems such as verbal and physical aggression towards others, self-injury and aggression towards objects and emotional reactions such as anxiety, depression, passivity and excessive sadness. In addition, psychotic symptoms, particularly visual hallucinations and delusions, and obsessive–compulsive symptoms have been reported [<xref rid=""B16-ijerph-19-05895"" ref-type=""bibr"">16</xref>,<xref rid=""B20-ijerph-19-05895"" ref-type=""bibr"">20</xref>,<xref rid=""B21-ijerph-19-05895"" ref-type=""bibr"">21</xref>]. Due to the devastating disease course and associated emotional and behavioural problems CLN3 disease has an enormous impact on the quality of life of the child and their family (e.g., parents and siblings) [<xref rid=""B17-ijerph-19-05895"" ref-type=""bibr"">17</xref>,<xref rid=""B22-ijerph-19-05895"" ref-type=""bibr"">22</xref>,<xref rid=""B23-ijerph-19-05895"" ref-type=""bibr"">23</xref>]. During the course of approximately 15 years of the disease, parents of a child with CLN3 disease have to deal with the medical conditions, disturbed behaviour and emotions of their child, as well as their own emotions [<xref rid=""B20-ijerph-19-05895"" ref-type=""bibr"">20</xref>]. Parents of children with health problems have a substantially greater chance of reporting chronic conditions, activity limitations, poor general health, and symptoms of depression than caregivers of healthy children [<xref rid=""B24-ijerph-19-05895"" ref-type=""bibr"">24</xref>,<xref rid=""B25-ijerph-19-05895"" ref-type=""bibr"">25</xref>,<xref rid=""B26-ijerph-19-05895"" ref-type=""bibr"">26</xref>]. In addition, they must learn to deal with these problems that occur more often in children with a chronic illness than in healthy children [<xref rid=""B27-ijerph-19-05895"" ref-type=""bibr"">27</xref>]. Progressive diseases such as CLN3 increase the demands on the family system as the child’s functionality decreases and the need for care increases [<xref rid=""B28-ijerph-19-05895"" ref-type=""bibr"">28</xref>,<xref rid=""B29-ijerph-19-05895"" ref-type=""bibr"">29</xref>,<xref rid=""B30-ijerph-19-05895"" ref-type=""bibr"">30</xref>]. Caring for a child with CLN3 disease places a very significant burden on the family system and includes parental feelings of loss, impact on family relationships and lack of understanding within the health/social insurance systems. While taking care of a child with deteriorating functions, they must also struggle to ensure that the child receives the supports and care they need from the health and social care system [<xref rid=""B31-ijerph-19-05895"" ref-type=""bibr"">31</xref>]. Exactly how CLN3 disease leads to specific behaviour and emotions is not yet fully understood. Research shows that both internalizing and externalizing symptoms are clinically elevated in children with CLN3 disease. The internalizing symptoms are significantly related to parents’ self-rated quality of life and may provide input for further study and intervention [<xref rid=""B16-ijerph-19-05895"" ref-type=""bibr"">16</xref>]. In the current study, we want to further explore the behaviour and emotions of children with CLN3 disease. Although support programs have been developed for children with behavioural problems, behavioural interventions have not been specifically evaluated for children with CLN3 disease [<xref rid=""B16-ijerph-19-05895"" ref-type=""bibr"">16</xref>]. Children with a decline in memory and attention may have limited abilities to benefit from behaviour management programs [<xref rid=""B32-ijerph-19-05895"" ref-type=""bibr"">32</xref>]. An educational and social support program has been developed for children with CLN3 disease, including for example music therapy and braille education [<xref rid=""B33-ijerph-19-05895"" ref-type=""bibr"">33</xref>]. However, no behavioural support or a formalisation on manners or contact with respect to these children has been formalised. In the Dutch NCL centre of expertise (a collaboration between Bartiméus, Royal Visio and the Wilhelmina Children’s Hospital) children with CLN3 disease receive medical care, counselling and acquire additional therapy (e.g., speech therapy, physiotherapy and behavioural support). Parents of these children receive support as well. Therefore, health professionals working with these children and their parents have a lot of knowledge on specific CLN3-support. This study aims at making this knowledge explicit.  For the quantitative analysis, the UBDRS-data were used. However, since UBDRS-data of only seven clients were available, only basic statistics could be used. In <xref rid=""app1-ijerph-19-05895"" ref-type=""app"">Appendix A</xref>, an overview of the data is presented (<xref rid=""ijerph-19-05895-t0A2"" ref-type=""table"">Table A2</xref>). The UBDRS-data show that the seven clients for whom UBDRS-data was available are all dealing with anxiety (<xref rid=""app1-ijerph-19-05895"" ref-type=""app"">Appendix A</xref>, <xref rid=""ijerph-19-05895-t0A3"" ref-type=""table"">Table A3</xref>). Some emotional and behavioural symptoms increase in frequency and intensity and some decrease (<xref rid=""app1-ijerph-19-05895"" ref-type=""app"">Appendix A</xref>, <xref rid=""ijerph-19-05895-f0A1"" ref-type=""fig"">Figure A1</xref>). No typical pattern (such as an n-shape, observed by Adams et al. [<xref rid=""B16-ijerph-19-05895"" ref-type=""bibr"">16</xref>]) was found. Below, the results of the qualitative analyses are presented, following the order of the overarching questions listed in the previous paragraph. An overview of behavioural, emotional and psychological symptoms resulted from the analysis, together with examples, where eleven distinct categories could be observed (See <xref rid=""ijerph-19-05895-t002"" ref-type=""table"">Table 2</xref>). Only instances of symptoms where an example could be given (the client number is given within parentheses), were listed. This means that the UBDRS-data in which only the prevalence of certain symptoms was indicated, have not been used here. To identify typical combinations and development of symptoms for each client, all behavioural and emotional symptoms were listed in chronological order and compared to symptoms of other clients. In this way, combinations of occurring symptoms, as well as typical sequences of symptoms: two or more (particular) consecutive symptoms that occur with several clients, could be identified. However, no typical combinations of symptoms and no typical development of symptoms could be identified. Every client showed a unique situation. To identify events or situations leading to (beginnings and endings) of behavioural and emotional symptoms data was investigated to see whether these symptoms were cooccurring with other information, such as physical symptoms of CLN3 disease. However, not all cooccurring pieces of information are necessarily connected to each other. Two cooccurring items were marked as a connection if these items started at the same time. Additionally, if a relation between two items was mentioned in the patient file or in an interview by either the parents or a health professional, this was notated as a connection as well. Note that, because of this method, no slowly progressing connections could be found. Only results accompanied by a substantial change at a certain moment are shown. In this way, for some clients, a situation or event leading to a beginning or ending of a certain behaviour or emotion was identified. These are listed below. From the list, no typical situations or events leading to behavioural and emotional symptoms could be identified.

However, from our analysis, no protective factors emerged. The severity of the behavioural symptoms does not seem to coincide with environmental or situational factors, such as, for example, the stability of the family. Illustrative of this is the fact that our data contained information on two brothers (clients 3 and 6) who both have CLN3 disease, one of whom has many behavioural symptoms while the other has not. The support that children with CLN3 disease receive can be divided into several categories. There is practical support, for example from physiotherapists and behavioural therapists; secondary support, consisting of advice from health professionals to teachers and parents; and (behavioural) medication. Furthermore, seven categories of specific CLN3 support could be identified that are used when being in direct contact with children with CLN3 disease, concerning the visual and cognitive decline faced by the children:<list list-type=""bullet""><list-item><p>Expressing in words what the environment looks like and what is happening</p></list-item><list-item><p>Offering structure: clear daily routines, rules and boundaries</p></list-item><list-item><p>Offer extra explanation and attention</p></list-item><list-item><p>Clarify communication and support social contact</p></list-item><list-item><p>Help to memorize things and to keep memories alive</p></list-item><list-item><p>Stimulation and encouragement</p></list-item><list-item><p>Acknowledging emotions and helping to control them</p></list-item></list> The observed support parents receive, could be categorised into four categories, displayed in <xref rid=""ijerph-19-05895-t003"" ref-type=""table"">Table 3</xref>. Finally, an overview of the problems that parents run into was made, see <xref rid=""ijerph-19-05895-t004"" ref-type=""table"">Table 4</xref>. The first four categories of this list: ‘emotions, interactions with the child, future prospect and practical issues’, correspond with the items in <xref rid=""ijerph-19-05895-t003"" ref-type=""table"">Table 3</xref>, which means that although these problems were mentioned, support concerning these problems was also mentioned. The bottom four categories consist of problems which were not mentioned in combination with support. In this study, data of children with CLN3 disease were analysed using a primarily qualitative approach. The focus was to examine the behavioural and emotional experiences, and support for the child and family. The results list the behavioural, emotional and psychological symptoms these children show. Additionally, overviews were made of the support these children and their parents receive. Furthermore, the problems that these parents face were listed. The analysis showed that for some children, certain behavioural and emotional symptoms are a direct consequence of CLN3 disease symptoms. The examples given in the qualitative analysis illustrate the findings. Finally, anxiety was noted for all clients whose UBDRS-data was available. The connections found (for some children) between emotions and behaviour and the CLN3 disease symptoms varied, and no general conclusions could be drawn. Cognitive decline could, for example, lead to anger but also to sadness, and physical decline could lead to sadness but also to anxiety. This means that, according to our analysis, every child reacts in a personal way to symptoms of CLN3 disease. It may be possible that the dataset was not big enough and too few clients were analysed to show significant behavioural and emotional patterns. Future research could shed light on this question. However, the present results are in line with research by Von Tetzchner et al. [<xref rid=""B17-ijerph-19-05895"" ref-type=""bibr"">17</xref>] who conclude that children with CLN3 disease react to their difficult life situation in diverse ways, both emotionally and behaviourally. The categories for the behavioural, emotional and psychological symptoms found in this study differ slightly from the standard UBDRS-categories ([<xref rid=""B18-ijerph-19-05895"" ref-type=""bibr"">18</xref>] See also <xref rid=""ijerph-19-05895-t0A2"" ref-type=""table"">Table A2</xref> in the <xref rid=""app1-ijerph-19-05895"" ref-type=""app"">Appendix A</xref>), since a data-driven approach was used where the categories emerged from the data. One of the categories, ‘passive’ is close to the UBDRS-category ‘apathy’ but differs in the sense that the passive behaviour did not necessarily include indifference and lack of emotion, which are implied by the term apathy. ‘Stereotype behaviour’ and ‘compulsion’, which are separate categories in the UBDRS, blended in our data-analysis. Four extra categories emerged from our analysis: ‘rebellious behaviour’, ‘demanding behaviour’, ‘focussing on the familiar’ and ‘increased sensitivity’. From the connections between CLN3 disease symptoms and emotions, and from the fact that anxiety was noted in all UBDRS-files, it can be concluded that emotions play a key role in the behaviour of these children. This is in line with Adams et al. [<xref rid=""B13-ijerph-19-05895"" ref-type=""bibr"">13</xref>] who found correlations between some emotions and behaviour. Possibly, typical behavioural of children with CLN3 disease may come from different causes: first, behaviour that can be seen as a direct consequence of the deterioration of certain brain functions, such as uninhibited behaviour, and second, behaviour that is a consequence of certain emotions, for example anxiety, that could lead to behaviour to look for control when one is slowly losing control, such as ‘focussing on the familiar’ and ‘demanding behaviour’. It is known that emotions can sometimes act as mediator between stimuli and behaviour [<xref rid=""B42-ijerph-19-05895"" ref-type=""bibr"">42</xref>] and the question is whether that is the case here. Future research is needed to investigate the connection between emotion and behaviour in CLN3 disease and the question whether a distinction can be made, dividing behaviour based on its cause. Results may contribute to better behavioural support for children with CLN3 disease. While educational and social support modules for children with CLN3 disease have been developed and focus for example on music therapy and braille [<xref rid=""B33-ijerph-19-05895"" ref-type=""bibr"">33</xref>], no list of advice on direct contact with these children has been formalised. With the list of seven categories of specific CLN3 support, tacit knowledge of professionals working with children with CLN3 disease has been made explicit. This list may form the beginning of a more formalised adaptable support-module, and professionals working with children with CLN3 disease, such as teachers and therapists, can use this list as a guide. The eight categories of problems of parents describe the different problems parents face from the moment that they are confronted with the diagnoses of their child. The families taking part in this study included children living at home as well as children part-time living in a specialized home care facility. These perspectives may give rise to different parental problems both included (however blended) in <xref rid=""ijerph-19-05895-t004"" ref-type=""table"">Table 4</xref>. These categories of problems can be compared with the themes resulting from the study by Krantz and colleagues [<xref rid=""B31-ijerph-19-05895"" ref-type=""bibr"">31</xref>] on parental experiences of having a child with CLN3 disease. Their theme ‘recurring losses’, referring to the feeling of losing a healthy child, the child’s loss of abilities and the loss of relationships is close to our category ‘emotions’ that includes sadness, anger and despair resulting primarily from these losses. Their theme ‘disruption of the family system’ relates to our category ‘interaction with other people’, since both include the changed relation with (and attention for) other children in the family and romantic relationships that are under pressure. Finally, the theme ‘Society is not developed for a progressive disease’ included difficulties parents faced with respect to contact with the health system, which is described in our category ‘interaction with health professionals’. Comparing our categories to another study, on the psychosocial impact of parenting a child with a lysosomal storage disorder [<xref rid=""B43-ijerph-19-05895"" ref-type=""bibr"">43</xref>], overlap can be found as well. In this study, two themes, ‘uncertainty and the unknown’ and ‘finding a way forward’ are both related to our category ‘future prospect’, while the theme ‘finding a way forward’ is also related to our category ‘choices with respect to CLN3 disease’. Their theme ‘all-encompassing impact’ includes subthemes ‘behaviour’, ‘emotions’ and ‘physical demands’ which correspond to our categories ‘interaction with the child’, ‘emotions’ and ‘practical issues’, respectively. Despite all problems parents with a child with CLN3 disease face, no official support module has been developed. However, parents with a child with CLN3 disease do receive support and this study has made the different kinds of support that parents receive explicit. The categories of support for parents are outlined in <xref rid=""ijerph-19-05895-t003"" ref-type=""table"">Table 3</xref>. It is worth noticing that three of the four categories include examples of contact with other parents with a child with CLN3 disease, either via the patient association or direct contact. This is in line with the study by Cozart et al. [<xref rid=""B22-ijerph-19-05895"" ref-type=""bibr"">22</xref>] showing that parents with a child with CLN3 disease expressed an interest in and preference for parent-to-parent communication for support and information about the disease. By comparing the categories of support with the categories of problems, it becomes clear that for some problems support is difficult to organise or has not been developed. The support categories outlined in <xref rid=""ijerph-19-05895-t003"" ref-type=""table"">Table 3</xref> and problem categories from <xref rid=""ijerph-19-05895-t004"" ref-type=""table"">Table 4</xref> may serve as point of departure for a support-module for parents with a child with CLN3 disease. The fact that many differences exist between children with CLN3 disease, indicates that case-sensitive or adaptable modules are needed. A limitation of the study was the non-uniformity of the data with respect to age and incompleteness of the data. In addition, the amount of data per client varied widely. For some clients, many reports were included in the patient files, while for others, only a few reports were available. The same was true for the UBDRS data: no structural periodic measurements were carried out for all clients. Furthermore, no perfect agreement between the UBDRS data and patient files of clients in a specific period was present. For example, if anxiety was reported in the UBDRS, one would expect to find anxiety also reported in the patient file of the same period, but this was not always the case. It can be concluded that relevant information is still missing, so certain connections (e.g., typical combinations of/connection between symptoms) were not found. Due to missing information in the patient files, the different stages of the CLN3 disease could also not be identified. CLN3 disease can be divided into four stages where the boundaries between the stages are marked by moments of increased physical deterioration [<xref rid=""B41-ijerph-19-05895"" ref-type=""bibr"">41</xref>]. In this study it was not possible to identify typical behaviour or emotions linked to a certain stage of the CLN3 disease. It is important to monitor the stage of disease together with the UBDRS, so more can be learned about behaviour and emotions regarding the stage of the disease and to offer specialized care and support. Since many differences exist between children with CLN3 disease, we recommend working towards case-sensitive or adaptable modules. Finally, although the experiences of siblings of children with CLN3 disease were not investigated in this research, from the interviews it became clear that many siblings face similar challenges as the parents. Therefore, in future research on support programmes for families, siblings deserve distinct attention. CLN3 disease is a rare neurodegenerative disease causing not only vision loss and decline in cognitive and motor skills, but also typical behaviour and emotions. Decline in physical and cognitive skills give rise to certain emotions and behaviour. These behavioural and emotional symptoms are different for each individual, although general characteristics can be found. More research is needed to examine the connection between emotions and behaviour. The examples resulting from the qualitative analysis illustrate the symptoms and problems that these children and families deal with and the support that they are currently receiving. The overviews may provide a lead to support-modules for children with CLN3-disease, focusing on behaviour and emotions, and for the families as a whole.",N/A,12 5 2022
Value of genetic testing for pediatric epilepsy: Driving earlier diagnosis of ceroid lipofuscinosis type 2 Batten disease,"This study assessed the effectiveness of genetic testing in shortening the time to diagnosis of late infantile neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis type 2 (CLN2) disease. Individuals who received epilepsy gene panel testing through Behind the Seizure<sup>®</sup>, a sponsored genetic testing program (Cohort A), were compared to children outside of the sponsored testing program during the same period (Cohort B). Two cohorts were analyzed: children aged ≥24 to ≤60 months with unprovoked seizure onset at ≥24 months between December 2016 and January 2020 (Cohort 1) and children aged 0 to ≤60 months at time of testing with unprovoked seizure onset at any age between February 2019 and January 2020 (Cohort 2). The diagnostic yield in Cohort 1A (<italic toggle=""yes"">n</italic> = 1814) was 8.4% (<italic toggle=""yes"">n</italic> = 153). The <italic toggle=""yes"">TPP1</italic> diagnostic yield within Cohort 1A was 2.9‐fold higher compared to Cohort 1B (1.0%, <italic toggle=""yes"">n</italic> = 18/1814 vs. .35%, <italic toggle=""yes"">n</italic> = 8/2303; <italic toggle=""yes"">p</italic> = .0157).

In February 2019, the eligibility criteria expanded to include children aged 0 to ≤60 months at the time of testing with unprovoked seizure onset at any age. Ordering clinicians completed the required eligibility criteria and optional medical history (e.g., language or developmental delays, motor disturbance, family history of epilepsy).

</xref> Variants were categorized as pathogenic (P), likely pathogenic (LP), variant of uncertain significance, likely benign, or benign. A molecular diagnosis (molecular diagnosis/diagnoses [MDx]) was determined based on inheritance patterns (e.g., two P/LP variants in genes associated with autosomal recessive disorders, one P/LP variant in genes associated with autosomal dominant disorders, X‐linked dominant disorders, or X‐linked recessive disorders [male only]). A negative result (No MDx) was defined as the absence of an MDx. Diagnostic yield was calculated based on the proportion of children with any MDx (All MDx) or an MDx in <italic toggle=""yes"">TPP1</italic> (CLN2 disease MDx). Two cohorts tested through the sponsored program were compared to children tested outside of the program. Cohort MDx1A included children aged ≥24 to ≤60 months at the time of testing with unprovoked seizure onset at ≥24 months who were tested through the BTS program at any time during the study period. Cohort 1A was compared to children aged ≥24 to ≤60 months with seizure onset at any age who were tested outside of the program during the same time period (Cohort 1B). Cohort 2A included children aged 0 to ≤60 months at the time of testing with unprovoked seizure onset prior to testing who received testing through the BTS program between February 2019 and January 2020. Cohort 2A was compared to children aged 0 to ≤60 months who were tested outside of the BTS program during the same time period (Cohort 2B).

Four (.22%) children had a CLN2 disease MDx (Figure <xref rid=""epi17269-fig-0001"" ref-type=""fig"">1B</xref>). The rate of CLN2 disease MDx in Cohort 2A was 1.5‐fold higher compared to Cohort 2B, although age at time of testing was statistically (but not clinically) different (27.5 ± 18.1 vs. 26.0 ± 17.9, <italic toggle=""yes"">p</italic> = .00253; Table <xref rid=""epi17269-sup-0001"" ref-type=""supplementary-material"">S1</xref>), demonstrating the effectiveness of targeted testing programs in enriching testing cohorts for rare diseases. Differences in timing of genetic testing and clinical characteristics based on genetic testing results (i.e., No MDx, All MDx, CLN2 disease MDx) were assessed in Cohort 1A. Average time from seizure onset to testing for No MDx, All MDx, and CLN2 disease MDx was 8.4 months, 6.9 months, and 9.8 months, respectively. A significant difference was observed in the mean time from first seizure to genetic testing among the No MDx and All MDx groups (8.4 vs. 6.9 months, <italic toggle=""yes"">p</italic> < .05). CLN2 disease was diagnosed significantly earlier in individuals than is typically the case for this disease (average time from first symptom = 9.8 ± 7.4 months vs. 22.7 ± 9.8 months,<xref rid=""epi17269-bib-0008"" ref-type=""bibr"">

<italic toggle=""yes"">p</italic> < .001). Average age at time of testing was similar for all three groups (Figure <xref rid=""epi17269-sup-0003"" ref-type=""supplementary-material"">S2</xref>). Differences in the clinical presentation were observed; those in the All MDx or CLN2 Disease MDx groups more often had language and/or motor delay, an abnormal electroencephalogram, and an abnormal magnetic resonance imaging compared to the No MDx cohort (<italic toggle=""yes"">p</italic> < .05 in all comparisons; Table <xref rid=""epi17269-tbl-0001"" ref-type=""table"">1</xref>, Figure <xref rid=""epi17269-sup-0004"" ref-type=""supplementary-material"">S3</xref>).

Family history of epilepsy was not associated with molecular genetic testing outcome (25.5%, All MDx; 36.9%, No MDx; <italic toggle=""yes"">p</italic> = .13).

<sup>14</sup>
</xref> genetic testing is underutilized, and there are limited professional consensus guidelines advocating such testing early in the diagnostic workup in routine clinical practice.

<sup>5</sup>
</xref> The offering of an expanded genetic testing panel allowed the BTS program to provide an MDx to children affected with both CLN2 disease and other genetic epilepsies even when that program had targeted a clinical presentation consistent with CLN2 disease. A CLN2 disease MDx was returned to 1.0% of children in Cohort 1A, representing 11.8% of all MDx in Cohort 1A (<italic toggle=""yes"">n</italic> = 18/153), and was 2.9‐fold higher compared to Cohort 1B, demonstrating how the program has helped identify affected individuals for a rare condition with a nonspecific phenotype by increasing awareness among clinicians and reducing barriers for patients to pursue testing. The overall MDx rate was lower in Cohort 1A (8.4%) compared to all other cohorts (1B, 15.0%; 2A, 16.2%; 2B, 19.5%). Although the diagnostic yield is expected to be lower for the older cohort, the variance is likely due not only to differences in age at testing but also to age at seizure onset per eligibility criteria (≥24 months), highlighting the benefits of expanding the eligibility criteria of the sponsored program. Furthermore, the average time from the first symptom to CLN2 disease MDx in the sponsored program was significantly shorter (by approximately 1 year) compared to the natural history published average (9.8 vs. 22.7 months<xref rid=""epi17269-bib-0008"" ref-type=""bibr"">

Early MDx has significant clinical impact in children with epilepsy by enabling earlier initiation of treatment that may attenuate clinical deterioration (e.g., US Food and Drug Administration‐approved treatments for CLN2 disease<xref rid=""epi17269-bib-0011"" ref-type=""bibr"">

Although this study was limited by the change in eligibility criteria and limited clinical information from children tested outside of the program, the data presented here support the calls for clinical practice guidelines to consider the utilization of genetic testing as a first‐tier test for individuals with epilepsy early in the diagnostic journey, or with neurodegenerative diseases presenting with epilepsy, such as CLN2 disease.<xref rid=""epi17269-bib-0018"" ref-type=""bibr"">

"Aggregation chimeras provide evidence of <italic toggle=""yes"">in vivo</italic> intercellular correction in ovine CLN6 neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis (Batten disease)","The neuronal ceroid lipofuscinoses (NCLs; Batten disease) are fatal, mainly childhood, inherited neurodegenerative lysosomal storage diseases. Sheep affected with a CLN6 form display progressive regionally defined glial activation and subsequent neurodegeneration, indicating that neuroinflammation may be causative of pathogenesis. In this study, aggregation chimeras were generated from homozygous unaffected normal and CLN6 affected sheep embryos, resulting in seven chimeric animals with varied proportions of normal to affected cells. These sheep were classified as affected-like, recovering-like or normal-like, based on their cell-genotype ratios and their clinical and neuropathological profiles. Neuropathological examination of the affected-like animals revealed intense glial activation, prominent storage body accumulation and severe neurodegeneration within all cortical brain regions, along with vision loss and decreasing intracranial volumes and cortical thicknesses consistent with ovine CLN6 disease. In contrast, intercellular communication affecting pathology was evident at both the gross and histological level in the normal-like and recovering-like chimeras, resulting in a lack of glial activation and rare storage body accumulation in only a few cells. Initial intracranial volumes of the recovering-like chimeras were below normal but progressively recovered to about normal by two years of age. All had normal cortical thicknesses, and none went blind. Extended neurogenesis was evident in the brains of all the chimeras. This study indicates that although CLN6 is a membrane bound protein, the consequent defect is not cell intrinsic. The lack of glial activation and inflammatory responses in the normal-like and recovering-like chimeras indicate that newly generated cells are borne into a microenvironment conducive to maturation and survival.","The neuronal ceroid lipofuscinoses (NCLs; Batten disease) are fatal lysosomal storage diseases that collectively constitute one of the most common childhood inherited neurodegenerative diseases. They also occur in animals. Different forms are caused by mutations in any one of 13 different genes, designated <italic toggle=""yes"">CLNs 1–8</italic> and <italic toggle=""yes"">10–14</italic> ([<xref rid=""pone.0261544.ref001"" ref-type=""bibr"">1</xref>], <ext-link http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink href=""http://www.ucl.ac.uk/ncl"" ext-link-type=""uri"">http://www.ucl.ac.uk/ncl</ext-link>). The group is defined by the near ubiquitous accumulation of protein, either the c subunit of mitochondrial ATP synthase or the sphingolipid activator proteins (SAPs) A and D, in lysosome-derived storage bodies in neurons and most somatic cells [<xref rid=""pone.0261544.ref001"" ref-type=""bibr"">1</xref>–<xref rid=""pone.0261544.ref004"" ref-type=""bibr"">4</xref>]. The other defining feature of the NCLs is regionally specific neurodegeneration and brain atrophy [<xref rid=""pone.0261544.ref005"" ref-type=""bibr"">5</xref>]. Clinical features are progressive mental and motor deterioration, blindness and seizures leading to premature death, usually between 7 years of age and early adulthood [<xref rid=""pone.0261544.ref001"" ref-type=""bibr"">1</xref>, <xref rid=""pone.0261544.ref002"" ref-type=""bibr"">2</xref>]. The best characterised large animal model of the disease is a CLN6 form in New Zealand South Hampshire sheep in which disease progression closely parallels that of variant late infantile human CLN6 [<xref rid=""pone.0261544.ref006"" ref-type=""bibr"">6</xref>–<xref rid=""pone.0261544.ref009"" ref-type=""bibr"">9</xref>]. CLN6 affected sheep develop clinical symptoms between 10 and 14 months, namely loss of vision and progressive neurological decline, and die prematurely, usually before 24 months [<xref rid=""pone.0261544.ref006"" ref-type=""bibr"">6</xref>]. Regionally defined and selective loss of cortical neurons in the CLN6 affected sheep is preceded by prenatal neuroinflammation, beginning in particular cortical foci which are associated with later symptomology [<xref rid=""pone.0261544.ref010"" ref-type=""bibr"">10</xref>–<xref rid=""pone.0261544.ref013"" ref-type=""bibr"">13</xref>]. Understanding the interconnections between the genetic lesion, lysosomal storage, and neurodegeneration is pivotal for determining options for therapy. <italic toggle=""yes"">CLN6</italic> encodes an endoplasmic reticulum resident protein of uncertain function [<xref rid=""pone.0261544.ref014"" ref-type=""bibr"">14</xref>–<xref rid=""pone.0261544.ref016"" ref-type=""bibr"">16</xref>], thus CLN6 disease is usually regarded as a cell intrinsic disorder unlikely to benefit from a therapeutic strategy reliant on cross-correction, whereby soluble lysosomal proteins secreted from cells are endocytosed into protein-deficient cells [<xref rid=""pone.0261544.ref017"" ref-type=""bibr"">17</xref>, <xref rid=""pone.0261544.ref018"" ref-type=""bibr"">18</xref>]. However the cellular loss in affected sheep is primarily restricted to the central nervous system (CNS) despite widespread storage body accumulation in most somatic cells, suggesting that location and connectivity, not phenotype or storage burden, determine neuronal survival in ovine CLN6 [<xref rid=""pone.0261544.ref003"" ref-type=""bibr"">3</xref>, <xref rid=""pone.0261544.ref012"" ref-type=""bibr"">12</xref>]. Furthermore, there is much evidence in the literature to suggest that some degree of intercellular transport and cross-correction could occur in CLN6 disease. For example, it is possible if the membrane bound CLN6 processes a soluble factor, perhaps in a way similar to reports that CLN7 processes CLN5 [<xref rid=""pone.0261544.ref019"" ref-type=""bibr"">19</xref>] or as part of a CLN6-CLN8 complex that recruits lysosomal enzymes at the ER for Golgi transfer [<xref rid=""pone.0261544.ref020"" ref-type=""bibr"">20</xref>], or if it modulates the expression of other glycosylated lysosomal hydrolases as suggested in CLN6 affected <italic toggle=""yes"">nclf</italic> mouse studies [<xref rid=""pone.0261544.ref021"" ref-type=""bibr"">21</xref>]. The generation of chimeric animal models provides a direct way to test whether affected cells are amenable to correction by unaffected normal cells <italic toggle=""yes"">in vivo</italic> [<xref rid=""pone.0261544.ref022"" ref-type=""bibr"">22</xref>–<xref rid=""pone.0261544.ref025"" ref-type=""bibr"">25</xref>]. For this study, aggregation chimeras were generated from homozygous unaffected normal and CLN6 affected sheep 16–32 cell morula stage embryos. The resultant chimeras possessed varying proportions of normal and affected cells and clinical and neuropathological profiles somewhere between those of affected and normal animals. Factors analysed in the chimeras included cortical atrophy, a definitive hallmark of NCL, neuroinflammation that has been strongly implicated in disease pathogenesis [<xref rid=""pone.0261544.ref011"" ref-type=""bibr"">11</xref>, <xref rid=""pone.0261544.ref013"" ref-type=""bibr"">13</xref>] and evidence of extended neurogenesis and clusters of newly generated neurons in the affected brain [<xref rid=""pone.0261544.ref026"" ref-type=""bibr"">26</xref>].  Simplistically the chimera generation strategy of fusing half the blastomeres from homozygous affected embryos and homozygous normal embryos (<xref rid=""pone.0261544.g001"" ref-type=""fig"">Fig 1A</xref>) should result in 50:50 affected:normal cell chimeras, however the lambs generated here had a wide range of affected:normal cell ratios, which also varied between different tissues within each animal. Contributions to chimerism in each lamb were assessed from coat-colour patterns (<xref rid=""pone.0261544.g001"" ref-type=""fig"">Fig 1B</xref>), blood DNA analysis and monitoring for any signs of clinical disease. Of the 15 lambs generated during this study, seven were classed as chimeric and kept for further analysis, while six were disregarded as 100% normal and two as 100% affected. As with other lysosomal storage diseases, the NCLs caused by soluble enzyme deficiencies are more likely to benefit from cross-correction than are diseases caused by intracellularly contained membrane bound proteins. Exogenous soluble enzymes can be provided by enzyme replacement, stem cell or gene therapies, as has been achieved in animal models and human patients [<xref rid=""pone.0261544.ref033"" ref-type=""bibr"">33</xref>–<xref rid=""pone.0261544.ref037"" ref-type=""bibr"">37</xref>]. Defects in membrane-bound proteins, including CLN6, an endoplasmic reticulum resident protein of unknown function [<xref rid=""pone.0261544.ref014"" ref-type=""bibr"">14</xref>–<xref rid=""pone.0261544.ref016"" ref-type=""bibr"">16</xref>], are considered harder therapeutic targets as the disease mechanism is anticipated to be intracellular. However, intracerebroventricular delivery of CLN6 gene therapy to the neonatal <italic toggle=""yes"">Cln6</italic> mutant mouse has been shown to prevent or drastically reduce all the pathological hallmarks of NCL, as well as improving behaviour and extending survival [<xref rid=""pone.0261544.ref038"" ref-type=""bibr"">38</xref>]. Safety and CNS targeting was confirmed in non-human primates [<xref rid=""pone.0261544.ref038"" ref-type=""bibr"">38</xref>] and a phase I/II CLN6 gene therapy trial is underway (Clinical trial.gov identifier: NCT02725580). However, brain size and complexity are important and it is not at all clear if the rescue of some cells can rescue the phenotype of a larger complex brain where cells are less accessible to transfection. In ovine CLN6, there is widespread storage body accumulation throughout the cells of the body [<xref rid=""pone.0261544.ref039"" ref-type=""bibr"">39</xref>] implying that the underlying pathological insult must be similar in all cells, yet severe degeneration is confined to the CNS and is regionally defined [<xref rid=""pone.0261544.ref013"" ref-type=""bibr"">13</xref>]. Cellular location and interconnectivity, rather than phenotype, are considered major determinants of neuron survival [<xref rid=""pone.0261544.ref012"" ref-type=""bibr"">12</xref>], indicating that intercellular interactions may be possible. Having normal and CLN6 affected cells intermixed within tissues, as in the chimeric sheep here, is a direct way to establish whether neuronal cells expressing the CLN6 protein influence other non-expressing neuronal cells at a cell biology level and whether therapies based on cellular cross-correction can affect the complex neurodegeneration and neuroinflammation characteristic of CLN6 NCL in a complex large animal brain.

The Unified Batten Disease Rating Scale (UBDRS): Validation and reliability in an independent CLN3 disease sample,,Full text not available in PMC,N/A,13 1 2023
Parental experiences of having a child with CLN3 disease (juvenile Batten disease) and how these experiences relate to family resilience,,"While individual rare diseases (RDs) are by definition of low prevalence (In Europe defined as <1 person in 2000) (<ext-link http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink href=""https://www.eurordis.org/content/what-rare-disease"" ext-link-type=""uri"">https://www.eurordis.org/content/what-rare-disease</ext-link> accessed 5 December 2021), the total number of affected individuals is high, about 3.5%–5.9% of the population (Wakap et al., <xref rid=""cch12993-bib-0025"" ref-type=""bibr"">2020</xref>). Most have neurological manifestations, involving central, peripheral nerve and muscle (Lancet Neurology, <xref rid=""cch12993-bib-0012"" ref-type=""bibr"">2011</xref>). Additionally, most RDs are associated with high unmet needs due to the lack of available and effective diagnosis and treatment measures as well as the relative lack of research to develop such measures (Reinhard et al., <xref rid=""cch12993-bib-0017"" ref-type=""bibr"">2021</xref>). As a response to the challenges of RD, the European Union has established European Reference Networks (ERNs) so that affected individual patients across Europe might benefit from improved diagnosis, care and treatment opportunities. As part of this initiative, patient involvement is emphasized with a focus on active involvement of Patient Advocacy Groups (ePAGs) representatives (Reinhard et al., <xref rid=""cch12993-bib-0017"" ref-type=""bibr"">2021</xref>) highlighting the need to understand the lived experience of patients and their families. CLN3 disease also known as juvenile Batten disease is a rare neurodegenerative condition caused by a mutation in the Ceroid‐Lipofuscinosis Neuronal 3 gene (Østergaard, <xref rid=""cch12993-bib-0015"" ref-type=""bibr"">2016</xref>). It is part of the neuronal ceroid lipofuscinoses (NCLs), monogenic inherited neurodegenerative disorders that typically present in the first decade of life (Mole et al., <xref rid=""cch12993-bib-0013"" ref-type=""bibr"">2019</xref>). CLN3 disease is believed to the most common form of NCL worldwide. The incidence of CLN3 varies in different countries, with the highest figures having been reported from Scandinavia (Uvebrant & Hagberg, <xref rid=""cch12993-bib-0024"" ref-type=""bibr"">1997</xref>). The incidence was 2.2 per 100,000 live births in Sweden, 4.8 in Finland, 3.7 in Norway, 2.0 in Denmark, and 7.0 in Iceland. Currently, all forms of NCLs are fatal (Mole et al., <xref rid=""cch12993-bib-0013"" ref-type=""bibr"">2019</xref>). In CLN3, treatment is symptomatic and supportive (Bäckman et al., <xref rid=""cch12993-bib-0003"" ref-type=""bibr"">2005</xref>). The children have normal development before disease onset. The first symptoms usually appear at 5–7 years with progressive visual impairment the first symptom in 80% of cases (Østergaard, <xref rid=""cch12993-bib-0015"" ref-type=""bibr"">2016</xref>), followed by cognitive decline, speech impairment, loss of motor skills and epilepsy in early adolescence (Østergaard, <xref rid=""cch12993-bib-0015"" ref-type=""bibr"">2016</xref>). Behavioural difficulties include social, thought and attention problems, aggression and sleep disturbances (Bäckman et al., <xref rid=""cch12993-bib-0003"" ref-type=""bibr"">2005</xref>). Psychotic symptoms, particularly visual hallucinations and delusions, and obsessive–compulsive symptoms have been reported (Adams et al., <xref rid=""cch12993-bib-0001"" ref-type=""bibr"">2013</xref>). Children are wheelchair‐bound by late adolescence and death usually occurs in third decade of life (Østergaard et al., <xref rid=""cch12993-bib-0014"" ref-type=""bibr"">2011</xref>). In a family system, members strive to maintain balance by using and developing their resources to cope with challenges. A crisis arises when challenges exceed existing resources leading to imbalance. Balance can be restored by the family adapting, acquiring new abilities, reducing the demands they face and creating meaning around their situation (Patterson & Garwick, <xref rid=""cch12993-bib-0016"" ref-type=""bibr"">1994</xref>). The presence of disease significantly affects the family system exposing the system to multiple stressors requiring adaption (Patterson & Garwick, <xref rid=""cch12993-bib-0016"" ref-type=""bibr"">1994</xref>). Progressive diseases such as CLN3 can with time increase the demands on the family system as the child's functionality decreases and the need for care increases (Zurynski et al., <xref rid=""cch12993-bib-0029"" ref-type=""bibr"">2017</xref>). Increasing care needs, a changed perspective on the future, loss of private life and spontaneity and expectations of, or uncertainty around death can lead to increased strains (Stabile & Allin, <xref rid=""cch12993-bib-0022"" ref-type=""bibr"">2012</xref>). The presence of care staff/assistants in the home can further impact on family structure as the nature of their participation in the family may be unclear and changeable (Goldstein & Kenet, <xref rid=""cch12993-bib-0009"" ref-type=""bibr"">2002</xref>; Zurynski et al., <xref rid=""cch12993-bib-0029"" ref-type=""bibr"">2017</xref>). Unpredictable symptoms such as epileptic seizures can further add to uncertainty and stress (Rodenburg et al., <xref rid=""cch12993-bib-0019"" ref-type=""bibr"">2007</xref>). Family resilience is the capacity of the family to withstand and rebound from stressful life challenges—emerging strengthened and more resourceful (Walsh, <xref rid=""cch12993-bib-0026"" ref-type=""bibr"">2003</xref>). Resilience entails more than managing stressful conditions, shouldering a burden or surviving an ordeal. It involves the potential for personal and relational transformation and positive growth that can be forged out of adversity (Walsh, <xref rid=""cch12993-bib-0027"" ref-type=""bibr"">2016</xref>). Walsh (<xref rid=""cch12993-bib-0026"" ref-type=""bibr"">2003</xref>) has identified nine processes organized into three domains that contribute to family resilience (see <xref rid=""cch12993-supitem-0001"" ref-type=""supplementary-material"">Supporting Information S1</xref>). The processes should be understood as interacting and dynamic where families can mobilize them depending on the challenges they face (Walsh, <xref rid=""cch12993-bib-0027"" ref-type=""bibr"">2016</xref>). The domain ‘belief systems’ includes three processes: making meaning of adversity, positive outlook and transcendence and spirituality. The domain ‘organizational processes’ includes the processes of flexibility, connectedness and mobilize social and economic resources. The domain ‘communication/problem solving’ includes clarity, open emotional sharing and collaborative problems solving. Research into supporting parental caregivers of children living with life‐threatening or life‐limiting illnesses suggests that caregiver themes include the need to organize basic needs; connect with others; prioritize self‐care; obtain meaningful information; take things day by day; advocate for parental participation; manifest positivity; and celebrate milestones (Smith et al., <xref rid=""cch12993-bib-0021"" ref-type=""bibr"">2018</xref>). This study involved caregivers and professionals of children with a range of life limiting diseases including cystic fibrosis, inoperable congenital heart defects, mucopolyscarridosis, paediatric cancers and severe hypoxic ischemic encephalopathy. Research regarding the specific impact of CLN3 on the family is limited. Schulz et al. (<xref rid=""cch12993-bib-0020"" ref-type=""bibr"">2020</xref>) examined the challenges of living with and caring for children with CLN2 disease, another NCL condition. Disease onset is earlier than in CLN3, and main symptoms are language and motor difficulties and seizures (Mole et al., <xref rid=""cch12993-bib-0013"" ref-type=""bibr"">2019</xref>). Families of children with CLN2 report lower quality of life, life satisfaction and lower satisfaction with their partner compared with the normal population (Schulz et al., <xref rid=""cch12993-bib-0020"" ref-type=""bibr"">2020</xref>). We are not aware of any research concerning resilience in the NCLs despite its importance in understanding adaptation to disease. The aim of the current study was thus to investigate parents' experience of having a child with CLN3 and how these experiences can be related to family resilience. A qualitative research approach employing semi‐structured interviews and convenience sampling was adopted. Participants were parents of children diagnosed with CLN3 disease attending or who had attended Queen Silvia's Hospital in Gothenburg, Sweden. Seven children with CLN3 disease were identified, and their parents were contacted by the research team in February/March 2021. Parents of all seven children expressed an interest in taking part. However, the parents of one child were unable to participate during the data collection period (March/April 2021). The parents of another child were not native Swedish speakers, and it was not possible to arrange a translator during the data collection period. Informed consent was provided by all participating parents. Eight parents (five mothers aged 41–51 and three fathers aged 40–51 years) of five children (three male and two female) diagnosed with CLN3 (aged 11–24 years, one deceased; see Table <xref rid=""cch12993-tbl-0001"" ref-type=""table"">1</xref> for further demographic information) were recruited. Two fathers did not participate in the interviews. The thematic analysis resulted in four main themes: ‘recurring losses’, ‘disruptions to the family system’, ‘society is not created for progressive disease’ (see Figure <xref rid=""cch12993-fig-0001"" ref-type=""fig"">1</xref>) and ‘expressions of resilience’ (see Figure <xref rid=""cch12993-fig-0002"" ref-type=""fig"">2</xref>) with six subthemes. The first three themes mainly focused on the difficulties caused by the disease, and the final theme focused on how the family adapted to these strains. This study is the first to our knowledge to examine the experiences of parenting a child with CLN3 and how these experiences relate to family resilience. The theme ‘recurring losses’ highlights the families of children with CLN3 experience recurring feelings of loss during the course of the disease. This feeling of recurring loss or grief has previously been described in accounts of parenting children with chronic illness (George et al., <xref rid=""cch12993-bib-0008"" ref-type=""bibr"">2007</xref>) and meant that parents had to constantly find ways to adapt to new circumstances and sometimes did not have time to adapt until the next loss occurred. At time of diagnosis, parents felt the loss of a healthy child and many of associated hopes and dreams they had for the child. This time of diagnosis and feelings of loss have been identified as often the most difficult periods of a child's illness (Clements et al., <xref rid=""cch12993-bib-0007"" ref-type=""bibr"">1990</xref>). Parents perceive further loss as the child regresses and loses skills across a range of functions. The advanced stage of the child's disease may include the perceived loss of the child's personality as they experience more difficult mental health/psychiatric difficulties. Children with CLN3 can develop symptoms of psychosis and parenting children with psychotic symptoms has been identified as associated with feelings of loss related to the child and the parent (Young et al., <xref rid=""cch12993-bib-0028"" ref-type=""bibr"">2019</xref>). Finally, parents may not only lose to the child to death but also part of their own identity. Previous research suggests that the loss of identity can lead to parents struggling with their sense of competence, mourning the lost parent–child bond and feel a loss of parental hopes for the future (Brotherson, <xref rid=""cch12993-bib-0006"" ref-type=""bibr"">2000</xref>). The theme ‘disruptions to family system’ includes the increasing care needs of child and how this can challenge the family system. The high care needs reported in this study mirrors that has also been found in parents of children with Sturge–Weber syndrome where it leads to a negative impact on sleep, difficulties to recharge/recover and hard to find time for oneself (Hilbert et al., <xref rid=""cch12993-bib-0010"" ref-type=""bibr"">2000</xref>). In parents of children with CLN3, there is a feeling of failure and guilt regarding the impact of the disease on siblings. Previous research has shown that the greatest negative effect on healthy siblings can be seen in families with children with a chronic illness that requires a lot of time, attention and daily care from parents (Sharpe & Rossiter, <xref rid=""cch12993-bib-0031"" ref-type=""bibr"">2002</xref>). The progressive nature of CLN3 means that the need for care increases, which may mean that siblings are negatively affected by the increased time required for the sick child's care. The impact on romantic relationships between the parents was also broached by parents in the current study and has been noted in previous studies of children with chronic illnesses (Kratz et al., <xref rid=""cch12993-bib-0011"" ref-type=""bibr"">2009</xref>). One of the main reasons for the strain was lack of time together highlighting the need for supports such as respite care to allow both parents to spend time together. The theme ‘society is not developed for a progressive disease’ highlights that families of children with CLN3 may have to deal with a lack of supportive environment outside of the family. It echoes previous research suggesting that parents of children with chronic illness often find dealing with health and social care systems as the most stressful aspects of their child's condition (George et al., <xref rid=""cch12993-bib-0008"" ref-type=""bibr"">2007</xref>). A family in crisis can function and maintain their well‐being depending not only on how the system mobilizes resources within the family (Ungar, <xref rid=""cch12993-bib-0023"" ref-type=""bibr"">2016</xref>) but also on the supports receives from the wider community. Thus, a perceived lack of support from community resources can impact negatively on the family and parental well‐being. Lack of knowledge among health care professionals of the disease is also an important aspect that the parents in this study highlighted and has also emerged in previous studies of families with children with progressive neurodegenerative diseases (Retzlaff, <xref rid=""cch12993-bib-0018"" ref-type=""bibr"">2007</xref>). In this study, we found that family resilience theory was applicable to the parents' experiences and that it was possible to identify expressions of resilience. The resilience model consists of nine processes that interact with each other; however, families do not have to mobilize all these processes to be seen as resilient. In terms of ‘shared belief systems’, a crisis can bring together and strengthen the family system through a unified view and insights into what is important and in the current study the parents managed to create meaning in a difficult situation. With respect to organizational processes, the current study suggest that affected families can show flexibility and positively adapt to the new situation. However, mobilizing social and economic resources can be hampered by factors outside the family system such as how well the health and social care mobilize to support the family. Families often perceived these as deficient, and therefore, they became a source of frustration and additional stress instead of promoting family resilience. With respect to communication and problem solving, open emotional sharing and collaborative problems solving were evident but was not possible in all families. It must be noted that it may not be possible to identify expressions of all aspects of family resilience and thus the family resilience approach or some of its aspects may not be a useful lens for all families. Trying to achieve a unified vision and common path in life is difficult and may in some cases be impossible as the challenges become too many and the resources within and outside the family too scarce (Walsh, <xref rid=""cch12993-bib-0027"" ref-type=""bibr"">2016</xref>). The current study is one of the first to focus on the impact of CLN3 disease on family functioning. Findings suggest that caring for a child with CLN3 disease places a very significant burden on the family system including parental feelings of loss, impact on family relationships and lack of understanding within the health/social insurance systems. Parents experience emotional and practical difficulties during the course of the disease. While taking care of a child with deteriorating function, they must also struggle to ensure that the child receives the supports and care they need from the health and social care system that often seems unprepared for the challenges of meeting the needs of children with progressive disease. Despite the challenges placed on the family system, it was possible to identify examples of family resilience. Parents can see life from a new perspective and shared memories and beliefs within the family promote resilience. Parents can create new networks with other families who also have a child with a disability. Parents may develop more effective ways of communicating and sharing of emotions. The results of the current study suggest that the concept of family resilience may be useful in understanding the experiences of families affected by CLN3 and other paediatric neurodegenerative conditions. Future research needs to focus on larger samples and include more formal measures of family resilience. The authors have no relevant conflicts of interest. This study was supported by the Swedish state under the agreement between the Swedish government and the country councils (ND: ALFGBG‐718681) and Ann‐Mari and Per Ahlqvist Foundation. The study had been approved by the national ethics committee (no. 2019–05101). ",N/A,04 3 2022
Autophagy in the Neuronal Ceroid Lipofuscinoses (Batten Disease),"The neuronal ceroid lipofuscinoses (NCLs), also referred to as Batten disease, are a family of neurodegenerative diseases that affect all age groups and ethnicities around the globe. At least a dozen NCL subtypes have been identified that are each linked to a mutation in a distinct ceroid lipofuscinosis neuronal (<italic toggle=""yes"">CLN</italic>) gene. Mutations in <italic toggle=""yes"">CLN</italic> genes cause the accumulation of autofluorescent lipoprotein aggregates, called ceroid lipofuscin, in neurons and other cell types outside the central nervous system. The mechanisms regulating the accumulation of this material are not entirely known. The <italic toggle=""yes"">CLN</italic> genes encode cytosolic, lysosomal, and integral membrane proteins that are associated with a variety of cellular processes, and accumulated evidence suggests they participate in shared or convergent biological pathways. Research across a variety of non-mammalian and mammalian model systems clearly supports an effect of <italic toggle=""yes"">CLN</italic> gene mutations on autophagy, suggesting that autophagy plays an essential role in the development and progression of the NCLs. In this review, we summarize research linking the autophagy pathway to the NCLs to guide future work that further elucidates the contribution of altered autophagy to NCL pathology.","The neuronal ceroid lipofuscinoses (NCLs) are a family of neurodegenerative diseases that affect all ethnicities and ages but predominantly affect children (<xref rid=""B322"" ref-type=""bibr"">Williams, 2011</xref>; <xref rid=""B180"" ref-type=""bibr"">Mole and Cotman, 2015</xref>). Commonly known as Batten disease, the different subtypes are each caused by a mutation in a distinct ceroid lipofuscinosis neuronal (<italic toggle=""yes"">CLN</italic>) gene (<italic toggle=""yes"">PPT1/CLN1</italic>, <italic toggle=""yes"">TPP1/CLN2</italic>, <italic toggle=""yes"">CLN3</italic>, <italic toggle=""yes"">DNAJC5/CLN4, CLN5</italic>, <italic toggle=""yes"">CLN6</italic>, <italic toggle=""yes"">MFSD8/CLN7</italic>, <italic toggle=""yes"">CLN8</italic>, <italic toggle=""yes"">CTSD/CLN10</italic>, <italic toggle=""yes"">PGRN/CLN11</italic>, <italic toggle=""yes"">ATP13A2/CLN12</italic>, <italic toggle=""yes"">CTSF/CLN13</italic>) (<xref rid=""T1"" ref-type=""table"">Table 1</xref>). In addition to these genes, previous research indicates that mutations in potassium channel tetramerization domain containing 7 <italic toggle=""yes"">(KCTD7)/CLN14</italic> may also cause a subtype of NCL called CLN14 disease (<xref rid=""B244"" ref-type=""bibr"">Staropoli et al., 2012</xref>) (<xref rid=""T1"" ref-type=""table"">Table 1</xref>). However, recent evidence points towards the majority of CLN14 disease cases being progressive myoclonus epilepsy with an autophagy-lysosome defect but without the classic NCL-type storage material present (<xref rid=""B130"" ref-type=""bibr"">Kousi et al., 2012</xref>; <xref rid=""B169"" ref-type=""bibr"">Metz et al., 2018</xref>). In addition, recent work suggests that mutations in TBC1 domain-containing kinase (TBCK)<italic toggle=""yes"">/CLN15</italic> may cause a new subtype of NCL referred to as CLN15 disease (<xref rid=""T1"" ref-type=""table"">Table 1</xref>) (<xref rid=""B147"" ref-type=""bibr"">Liu et al., 2013</xref>; <xref rid=""B47"" ref-type=""bibr"">Chong et al., 2016</xref>; <xref rid=""B15"" ref-type=""bibr"">Beck-Wödl et al., 2018</xref>). Mutations in <italic toggle=""yes"">CLN</italic> genes cause the lysosomal accumulation of ceroid lipofuscin, which is an autofluorescent material composed of lipid-protein aggregates (<xref rid=""B191"" ref-type=""bibr"">Palmer et al., 1992</xref>; <xref rid=""B209"" ref-type=""bibr"">Radke et al., 2015</xref>). NCL patients experience a variety of clinical symptoms including seizures, progressive loss in vision, movement, and cognitive capability, and premature death (<xref rid=""B233"" ref-type=""bibr"">Schulz et al., 2013</xref>). The proposed functions of CLN proteins are varied, where some function as lysosomal enzymes, others are predicted to regulate intracellular trafficking or transport across membranes (<xref rid=""B36"" ref-type=""bibr"">Cárcel-Trullols et al., 2015</xref>). Unfortunately, the cellular roles of most of the CLN proteins are not fully understood, which has motivated the use of a diversity of model systems to study the NCLs, ranging from lower eukaryotic model organisms such as yeast and the social amoeba <italic toggle=""yes"">Dictyostelium discoideum</italic> to animal models and patient-derived cell lines (<xref rid=""B96"" ref-type=""bibr"">Huber et al., 2020</xref>; <xref rid=""B171"" ref-type=""bibr"">Minnis et al., 2020</xref>). Accumulated research across a variety of model systems supports autophagy as a central process disrupted in multiple NCL subtypes. Autophagy is a cellular process that provides cells with energy during periods of stress, degrades unnecessary or dysfunctional intracellular material (e.g., organelles and misfolded proteins), and plays a role in neuroprotection (<xref rid=""B263"" ref-type=""bibr"">Tsukada and Ohsumi, 1993</xref>; <xref rid=""B258"" ref-type=""bibr"">Thumm et al., 1994</xref>; <xref rid=""B175"" ref-type=""bibr"">Mizushima et al., 2002</xref>; <xref rid=""B159"" ref-type=""bibr"">Cuervo, 2004</xref>; <xref rid=""B139"" ref-type=""bibr"">Levine and Klionsky, 2004</xref>; <xref rid=""B301"" ref-type=""bibr"">Yorimitsu and Klionsky, 2005</xref>; <xref rid=""B21"" ref-type=""bibr"">Bossy et al., 2008</xref>; <xref rid=""B81"" ref-type=""bibr"">Glick et al., 2010</xref>). In this review, we summarize the impact of loss-of-function mutations in <italic toggle=""yes"">CLN</italic> genes on the autophagy pathway, and we describe how further studies on this pathway in NCL model systems will establish important mechanistic insights and the potential for autophagy as a therapeutic target. Since research on KCTD7 and TBCK in the context of the NCLs and autophagy is limited, they will not be discussed in this review. Autophagic dysregulation has been studied in several neurodegenerative diseases and accumulated evidence indicates it contributes to NCL pathology (<xref rid=""B52"" ref-type=""bibr"">Croce and Yamamoto, 2019</xref>; <xref rid=""B94"" ref-type=""bibr"">Hou et al., 2020</xref>; <xref rid=""B73"" ref-type=""bibr"">Festa et al., 2021</xref>). There are many forms of autophagy, but three main forms in mammals are microautophagy (cytoplasmic material taken up directly by lysosomes/cytoplasmic vacuoles), chaperone-mediated autophagy (selective lysosomal uptake of cytoplasmic macromolecules), and macroautophagy (reviewed in <xref rid=""B156"" ref-type=""bibr"">Majeski and Dice, 2004</xref>; <xref rid=""B141"" ref-type=""bibr"">Li et al., 2012</xref>; <xref rid=""B71"" ref-type=""bibr"">Feng et al., 2014</xref>; <xref rid=""B215"" ref-type=""bibr"">Riebisch et al., 2021</xref>). Macroautophagy involves the degradation of cytoplasmic macromolecules and organelles during times of cellular stress such as starvation, and this form of autophagy will be the focus of this review. Hereafter, we will use “autophagy” only to refer to macroautophagy. In autophagy, a double-membrane vesicle called an autophagosome forms around intracellular material slated for degradation. The autophagosome is formed through a series of steps that starts with the Unc-51 like autophagy activating kinase 1 (ULK1) complex (<xref rid=""F1"" ref-type=""fig"">Figure 1</xref>) (<xref rid=""B176"" ref-type=""bibr"">Mizushima, 2010</xref>; <xref rid=""B207"" ref-type=""bibr"">Quan and Lee, 2013</xref>; <xref rid=""B18"" ref-type=""bibr"">Bento CF. et al., 2016</xref>; <xref rid=""B105"" ref-type=""bibr"">Hurley and Young, 2017</xref>). The ULK1 complex is composed of four proteins; serine/threonine-protein kinase ULK1, autophagy-related protein 101 (ATG101), autophagy-related protein 13 (ATG13), and focal adhesion kinase family interacting protein of 200 kDa (FIP200), which initiate the formation of the autophagosomal membrane (also known as a phagophore) (<xref rid=""B176"" ref-type=""bibr"">Mizushima, 2010</xref>; <xref rid=""B207"" ref-type=""bibr"">Quan and Lee, 2013</xref>; <xref rid=""B18"" ref-type=""bibr"">Bento CF. et al., 2016</xref>; <xref rid=""B105"" ref-type=""bibr"">Hurley and Young, 2017</xref>). The ULK1 complex is regulated by mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) complex 1 (mTORC1) and protein kinase B (PKB, also known as Akt), whose activation are dependent upon the availability of nutrients, particularly free amino acids (<xref rid=""B176"" ref-type=""bibr"">Mizushima, 2010</xref>; <xref rid=""B182"" ref-type=""bibr"">Mrschtik and Ryan, 2015</xref>; <xref rid=""B105"" ref-type=""bibr"">Hurley and Young, 2017</xref>). Akt is a serine/threonine protein kinase that is activated by phosphatidylinositol-3,4,5-triphosphate (PIP3), which is generated by phosphoinositide-3-kinase (PI3K) signal transduction (<xref rid=""B4"" ref-type=""bibr"">Alessi and Cohen, 1998</xref>; <xref rid=""B63"" ref-type=""bibr"">Dibble and Cantley, 2015</xref>). Activated Akt indirectly activates mTORC1 through a series of protein interactions, including dissociation of the tuberous sclerosis complex and GTPase Ras homolog enriched in brain (RHEB) in its GDP form (<xref rid=""B63"" ref-type=""bibr"">Dibble and Cantley, 2015</xref>). After dissociation occurs, GTP-bound RHEB is formed, which initiates mTORC1 activity (<xref rid=""B63"" ref-type=""bibr"">Dibble and Cantley, 2015</xref>). mTORC1 is a serine/threonine kinase in the mTOR pathway that is involved in many cellular processes including, but not limited to, autophagy, protein synthesis, and lysosomal biogenesis (<xref rid=""B182"" ref-type=""bibr"">Mrschtik and Ryan, 2015</xref>; <xref rid=""B229"" ref-type=""bibr"">Saxton and Sabatini, 2017</xref>). In nutrient-rich conditions, Akt is phosphorylated, which leads to mTORC1 activation (<xref rid=""F1"" ref-type=""fig"">Figure 1</xref>) (<xref rid=""B176"" ref-type=""bibr"">Mizushima, 2010</xref>; <xref rid=""B207"" ref-type=""bibr"">Quan and Lee, 2013</xref>; <xref rid=""B105"" ref-type=""bibr"">Hurley and Young, 2017</xref>; <xref rid=""B229"" ref-type=""bibr"">Saxton and Sabatini, 2017</xref>). Activated mTORC1 then phosphorylates ATG13, which inhibits ULK1 complex kinase activity, consequently preventing autophagosome formation (<xref rid=""B176"" ref-type=""bibr"">Mizushima, 2010</xref>; <xref rid=""B207"" ref-type=""bibr"">Quan and Lee, 2013</xref>; <xref rid=""B105"" ref-type=""bibr"">Hurley and Young, 2017</xref>; <xref rid=""B229"" ref-type=""bibr"">Saxton and Sabatini, 2017</xref>). Conversely, starvation inhibits mTORC1 activity, which facilitates autophagosomal formation via the ULK1 complex. The kinase activity of ULK1 in the ULK1 complex causes vacuolar protein sorting (VPS) 34 (VPS34) to associate with the phagophore (<xref rid=""F1"" ref-type=""fig"">Figure 1</xref>) (<xref rid=""B18"" ref-type=""bibr"">Bento CF. et al., 2016</xref>). VPS34 is part of a tetramer complex composed of serine/threonine-protein kinase VPS15, beclin-1 (BECN1), and either BECN1-associated autophagy-related key regulator (ATG14) or UV radiation resistance-associated gene (UVRAG) (denoted as Class III PI3K complex I or Class III PI3K complex II, respectively) (<xref rid=""B119"" ref-type=""bibr"">Kang et al., 2011</xref>; <xref rid=""B207"" ref-type=""bibr"">Quan and Lee, 2013</xref>; <xref rid=""B18"" ref-type=""bibr"">Bento CF. et al., 2016</xref>). The Class III PI3K complex I generates PI3P at the phagophore, which is required for the attachment of microtubule-associated protein 1A/1B-light chain 3 (LC3, also referred to as both LC3-b and autophagy-related protein 8, ATG8, but will be referred to as LC3 from hereon) to the phagophore for autophagosome formation. The Class III PI3K complex II is involved in autophagosome maturation (<xref rid=""F1"" ref-type=""fig"">Figure 1</xref>) (<xref rid=""B66"" ref-type=""bibr"">Dooley et al., 2014</xref>; <xref rid=""B18"" ref-type=""bibr"">Bento CF. et al., 2016</xref>). Phagophore closure is regulated by several autophagy proteins (<xref rid=""F1"" ref-type=""fig"">Figure 1</xref>) (<xref rid=""B119"" ref-type=""bibr"">Kang et al., 2011</xref>; <xref rid=""B207"" ref-type=""bibr"">Quan and Lee, 2013</xref>; <xref rid=""B18"" ref-type=""bibr"">Bento CF. et al., 2016</xref>). Cysteine protease ATG4 (ATG4) is a cysteine protease that cleaves LC3 to expose the C-terminal glycine which results in the formation of LC3-I (<xref rid=""F1"" ref-type=""fig"">Figure 1</xref>) (<xref rid=""B18"" ref-type=""bibr"">Bento CF. et al., 2016</xref>; <xref rid=""B162"" ref-type=""bibr"">Maruyama and Noda, 2018</xref>). Ubiquitin (Ub)-like modifier-activating enzyme ATG7 (ATG7) further processes LC3-I through ATP-dependent adenylation, thus forming an ATG7-LC3-I thioester-linked intermediate (<xref rid=""B18"" ref-type=""bibr"">Bento CF. et al., 2016</xref>; <xref rid=""B162"" ref-type=""bibr"">Maruyama and Noda, 2018</xref>). Subsequently, LC3 in the ATG7-LC3-I intermediate is transferred and thioester-linked to ubiquitin-like-conjugating enzyme ATG3 (ATG3) (<xref rid=""B162"" ref-type=""bibr"">Maruyama and Noda, 2018</xref>). Finally, through the actions of the autophagy protein 5 (ATG5)/ubiquitin-like protein ATG12 (ATG12)/autophagy-related protein 16-1 (ATG16-1)/WD repeat domain phosphoinositide-interacting protein 2 (WIPI2) complex, LC3-I in the ATG3-LC3-I intermediate attaches to phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) at the phagophore via an amide bond, forming LC3-II (<xref rid=""B66"" ref-type=""bibr"">Dooley et al., 2014</xref>; <xref rid=""B18"" ref-type=""bibr"">Bento CF. et al., 2016</xref>; <xref rid=""B162"" ref-type=""bibr"">Maruyama and Noda, 2018</xref>). The ATG5/ATG12/ATG16-1/WIPI2 complex is formed through a series of protein conjugation steps, which includes ATG7 cleaving the C-terminal end of ATG12 to expose a glycine residue (<xref rid=""B18"" ref-type=""bibr"">Bento CF. et al., 2016</xref>). Like the ATG3-LC3-I intermediate, ATG12 is conjugated to ubiquitin-like-conjugating enzyme ATG10 (ATG10), forming an ATG10-ATG12 intermediate, which is then linked with ATG5. Lastly, the ATG5-ATG12 intermediate binds with ATG16-1 and WIPI2 at the phagophore, which then interacts with ATG16-1 to form a complex at the phagophore (<xref rid=""B18"" ref-type=""bibr"">Bento CF. et al., 2016</xref>). The ATG5/ATG12/ATG16-1/WIPI2 complex facilitates LC3 PE lipidation at the phagophore, which closes the phagophore leading to the formation of an autophagosome (<xref rid=""F1"" ref-type=""fig"">Figure 1</xref>) (<xref rid=""B76"" ref-type=""bibr"">Fujita et al., 2008</xref>; <xref rid=""B221"" ref-type=""bibr"">Romanov et al., 2012</xref>; <xref rid=""B279"" ref-type=""bibr"">Walczak and Martens, 2013</xref>; <xref rid=""B18"" ref-type=""bibr"">Bento CF. et al., 2016</xref>). Finally, the autophagosome fuses with a lysosome via the aforementioned Class III PI3K complex II, ultimately forming an autolysosome (<xref rid=""F1"" ref-type=""fig"">Figure 1</xref>) (see <xref rid=""B18"" ref-type=""bibr"">Bento et al., 2016b</xref> for detailed mechanism). LC3-II is attached on the cytosolic side of the autophagosome and functions as a receptor for p62 (also referred to as sequestosome 1, SQSTM1), which directs protein cargo for autophagic degradation (<xref rid=""B119"" ref-type=""bibr"">Kang et al., 2011</xref>; <xref rid=""B207"" ref-type=""bibr"">Quan and Lee, 2013</xref>; <xref rid=""B143"" ref-type=""bibr"">Lippai and Low, 2014</xref>). Overall, autophagy proteins are essential for initiating autophagosome formation and generating autolysosomes for autophagic degradation. Previous research indicates that impaired autophagy contributes to the neurodegeneration associated with several neurological diseases, including, but not limited to, Huntington’s disease, Alzheimer’s disease, and Parkinson’s disease (<xref rid=""B84"" ref-type=""bibr"">Guo et al., 2018</xref>). The examination of these autophagy-related processes, among others, resulted in a considerable amount of research indicating that autophagic dysregulation is a pathological mechanism of the NCLs. In this review, we will discuss the impact of loss-of-function of each <italic toggle=""yes"">CLN</italic> gene and protein on autophagy using research gathered from multiple model systems, starting from the effects of <italic toggle=""yes"">CLN</italic> gene mutation on transcription and ending with the roles of CLN proteins on lysosomal reformation.  This review highlights the roles of <italic toggle=""yes"">CLN</italic> genes and proteins in autophagy. Since mutations in <italic toggle=""yes"">CLN</italic> genes cause neurodegeneration that is associated with compromised autophagy, targeting this essential cellular process may provide new therapeutic opportunities. For example, in CLN3 disease, multiple preclinical studies have shown promise for pharmacologic approaches to stimulate autophagy/autophagic degradation (<xref rid=""B41"" ref-type=""bibr"">Chang et al., 2011</xref>; <xref rid=""B192"" ref-type=""bibr"">Palmieri et al., 2017</xref>; <xref rid=""B200"" ref-type=""bibr"">Petcherski et al., 2019</xref>; <xref rid=""B127"" ref-type=""bibr"">Kinarivala et al., 2020</xref>; <xref rid=""B242"" ref-type=""bibr"">Soldati et al., 2021</xref>). Notably, two upcoming clinical trials for CLN3 disease to test compounds that promote TFEB activation, which enhances autophagy, have been announced by Theranexus and the Beyond Batten disease Foundation (BBDF-1010, Investigational New Drug approval announced, <ext-link http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink href=""http://beyondbatten.org"" ext-link-type=""uri"">beyondbatten.org</ext-link>) and Polaryx (PLX-200, <ext-link http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink href=""http://ClinicalTrials.gov"" ext-link-type=""uri"">ClinicalTrials.gov</ext-link> identifier: NCT04637282). Compounds/targets that enhance autophagic degradation are also candidates for the treatment of other forms of NCL; in particular, forms that show reduced degradation upon loss of function of the CLN protein (e.g., MFSD8/CLN7, ATP13A2/CLN12). For many of the NCLs caused by lysosomal enzyme deficiencies, pharmacologic approaches leading to enhanced lysosomal biogenesis and stimulation of autophagy also merit further study, since this may partially compensate for the impact of enzyme deficiency on lysosomal function. Further studies are needed that will more thoroughly dissect the mechanisms of autophagic dysregulation for each of the subtypes of NCL, but it is likely that multiple forms of NCL could benefit from common approaches targeting the autophagy pathway. Aberrant autophagy is also linked to other forms of neurodegeneration including Alzheimer, Huntington, and Parkinson disease (<xref rid=""B52"" ref-type=""bibr"">Croce and Yamamoto, 2019</xref>; <xref rid=""B94"" ref-type=""bibr"">Hou et al., 2020</xref>; <xref rid=""B73"" ref-type=""bibr"">Festa et al., 2021</xref>). Therefore, advances towards therapies targeting autophagy are very likely to impact drug development efforts across the NCLs and other neurological diseases. Finally, the NCL research community has generated a variety of experimental models to study the NCLs, ranging from model organisms such as yeast and <italic toggle=""yes"">D. discoideum</italic>, to small (e.g., mice) and large animal (e.g., dogs, sheep) models, and patient-derived human models (<xref rid=""B96"" ref-type=""bibr"">Huber et al., 2020</xref>; <xref rid=""B171"" ref-type=""bibr"">Minnis et al., 2020</xref>). Collectively, these systems can be used to further explore the precise roles of <italic toggle=""yes"">CLN</italic> genes and proteins in regulating autophagy.",N/A,16 2 2022
"Application of Anticonvulsants, Antiepileptic Drugs, and Vitamin C in the Treatment and Analysis of Batten Disease","Batten disease is a rare group of neurological diseases, specifically called neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis. This is a genetic disorder and usually manifests during childhood. Batten disease is fatal and there is currently no proven cure. However, there are certain treatment methods that show potential in mitigating the aftermath of the disease. This review will explore the application and effectiveness of antiepileptic drugs, anticonvulsants, and vitamin C in multiple scenarios to treat Batten disease. Anticonvulsants are a broad group of medications that are used to treat epileptic seizures. Epileptic seizures are a big indicator of Batten disease, making anticonvulsants a potential treatment for Batten disease patients. Antiepileptic drugs also work to stop seizures by decreasing neurological excitation, thus for the same reason are often grouped alongside anticonvulsants and are being investigated as a promising way to help Batten disease patients. Vitamin C helps maintain the integrity of several intracellular processes in the central nervous system, which makes it a possible candidate for treating Batten disease. The known effects of anticonvulsants, antiepileptic drugs, and vitamin C on Batten disease are very limited and should be considered more often by healthcare professionals because of their potential effects on patients with Batten disease.","Batten disease is a broad cohort of genetic disorders of the nervous system, also known as neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis (NCL) or ceroid lipofuscinosis, neuronal (CNL). These diseases are fatal and rare. Each specific disease in the group shares a specific defected gene (the gene depends on the specific disease), which interferes with the cell’s ability to recycle certain compounds and molecules [<xref rid=""REF1"" ref-type=""bibr"">1</xref>]. Most commonly, Batten disease refers to the juvenile onset of CNL. Common symptoms of Batten disease are seizures, vision loss, abnormal movements of the body, and insomnia [<xref rid=""REF1"" ref-type=""bibr"">1</xref>]. Over time, the symptoms can progress into worsened seizures and loss of language and motor skills. Eventually, Batten disease patients become blind, bedridden, and lose all cognitive function [<xref rid=""REF2"" ref-type=""bibr"">2</xref>]. The potential risk of death depends on the exact form of Batten disease and the age of onset of Batten disease [<xref rid=""REF3"" ref-type=""bibr"">3</xref>]. Of every 100,000 babies born in the United States (US), two to four have inherited Batten disease from their biological parents [<xref rid=""REF4"" ref-type=""bibr"">4</xref>]. Both males and females have an equal chance of inheriting Batten disease [<xref rid=""REF4"" ref-type=""bibr"">4</xref>-<xref rid=""REF5"" ref-type=""bibr"">5</xref>].  There is currently no cure for any of the forms of Batten’s disease. However, in 2017, the FDA approved an enzyme replacement therapy for ceroid lipofuscinosis, neuronal type 2 (CLN2) disease, in which patients present a tripeptidyl-peptidase 1 deficiency [<xref rid=""REF5"" ref-type=""bibr"">5</xref>]. However, the enzyme replacement therapy procedure approved by the FDA is only for the CLN2 form of Batten disease and is not applicable to the other diseases that are encompassed in the group. Additionally, the enzyme replacement therapy procedure costs $702,000 yearly, meaning it costs $27,000 per biweekly infusion [<xref rid=""REF6"" ref-type=""bibr"">6</xref>]. There are other treatment methods used to alleviate the symptoms of Batten disease, which are less expensive and more accessible. This review will examine anticonvulsants, antiepileptic drugs, and vitamin C and their effects on Batten disease patients.  This research paper aims to explore the effects of anticonvulsants, antiepileptic drugs, and vitamin C on the symptoms of Batten disease. A literature search of articles published between 1988 and 2021 using PubMed was performed using the keywords “Batten disease”, “anticonvulsant”, “antiepileptic drug”, “vitamin C”, and “seizures”. Cases that included infants, the elderly, allergies related to anticonvulsants, antiepileptic drugs, and vitamin C, existing history of other previous neural surgeries, and head trauma were excluded. Titles and abstracts were analyzed to ensure patients were not in a compromised state prior to treatment of Batten disease. Only articles that were available online and in English were included in this review. The articles reviewed included case studies and group studies. The articles were analyzed for the type of treatment used for Batten disease, the dosage of the treatment method, and the overall results on the patient. Results from the studies done were analyzed in a mixed-methodology manner, using both quantitative and qualitative analysis to create a holistic review. The quantitative analysis included percentages of effectiveness in some of the treatments, such as how many patients had improvements with elements of their condition, such as seizures. The qualitative analysis included descriptions of visual elements of Batten disease such as the frequency and severity of seizures. A total of 56 articles were identified of which 40 were actually reviewed, due to the aforementioned criteria. Anticonvulsants Anticonvulsants are medications used to counteract seizures [<xref rid=""REF7"" ref-type=""bibr"">7</xref>]. Anticonvulsants work by calming brain hyperactivity [<xref rid=""REF8"" ref-type=""bibr"">8</xref>]. Anticonvulsant drugs decrease signals in the brain that increase the probability of seizures and also help reduce the frequency and severity of seizures, should they occur. They also prevent seizures from spreading within the brain through the blockage of sodium channels. The nerves can be damaged by a wide variety of factors, such as injury or exposure to neurotoxins. Anticonvulsants interfere with the overactive transmission of pain signals sent from damaged nerves, easing the patient’s pain. The general role of anticonvulsants is to act as both a mood stabilizer and to treat the patient’s neuropathic pain. Many antiepileptic drugs block sodium channels or enhance γ-aminobutyric acid functions, which has anti-seizure and anti-anxiety effects by blocking neurotransmissions [<xref rid=""REF8"" ref-type=""bibr"">8</xref>]. Through the blockage of sodium or calcium channels, there is a significant reduction in the release of excitatory molecule glutamate, whose release is considered to be elevated in epileptic activities. A common anticonvulsant is lamotrigine, which is used to treat bipolar disorder and certain types of seizure disorders [<xref rid=""REF8"" ref-type=""bibr"">8</xref>]. Valproate is another type of anticonvulsant that can also be helpful in mitigating migraine pain, in addition to treating bipolar disorder and seizures [<xref rid=""REF8"" ref-type=""bibr"">8</xref>].  Antiepileptic drugs Antiepileptic drugs are another potential treatment method for Batten disease. Antiepileptic drugs also work to stop seizures and are often grouped together with anticonvulsants. Antiepileptic drugs affect electrical activity in the neurons by changing ion concentrations in the cell membrane [<xref rid=""REF9"" ref-type=""bibr"">9</xref>]. They are also known for altering chemical transmission between neurons by affecting neurotransmitters in the synapse. These medications are said to help control seizures in seven out of 10 people [<xref rid=""REF9"" ref-type=""bibr"">9</xref>]. They are usually prescribed to children with recurrent seizures, making them a probable treatment for patients with Batten disease. Isradipine is an antiepileptic drug that has neuroprotective effects. Isradipine is able to create some dopamine fibers and cell bodies at concentrations achievable in humans, suggesting that isradipine is a potentially viable neuroprotective agent that can help patients with neurological disorders, such as Batten disease [<xref rid=""REF9"" ref-type=""bibr"">9</xref>]. Vitamin C Vitamin C is also a potential candidate for treatment for Batten disease, as vitamin C is involved in the physiology of the nervous system, including the support and the structure of the neurons [<xref rid=""REF10"" ref-type=""bibr"">10</xref>]. This is a molecule found in many foods and is noted as an essential component of the enzymatic production of some neurotransmitters. vitamin C specifically aids in the processes of differentiation, maturation, and neuronal survival. Vitamin C is also considered to be a critical antioxidant in the brain [<xref rid=""REF11"" ref-type=""bibr"">11</xref>]. Many neurological disorders, including Batten disease, are known for excessive creation of free radicals, and the highest concentration of vitamin C is typically found in the brain and neuroendocrine tissues. Therefore, it can be suggested that Vitamin C could be a factor in changing the course of neurological issues and be of therapeutic use to patients [<xref rid=""REF12"" ref-type=""bibr"">12</xref>]. Vitamin C deficiency has been linked to nerve dysfunction [<xref rid=""REF13"" ref-type=""bibr"">13</xref>]. Additionally, intracellular vitamin C catalyzes several functions in the central nervous system, such as antioxidant protection, peptide amidation, myelin formation, synaptic potentiation, and protection against glutamate toxicity [<xref rid=""REF14"" ref-type=""bibr"">14</xref>].  Dosage of anticonvulsants, antiepileptic drugs, and vitamin C Many anticonvulsant treatment plans involve introducing the anticonvulsant to the patient slowly to minimize potential side effects. For instance, it takes a couple of months to increase the adult dosage to 200 milligrams per day. The typical adult dosage tends to be 0.5-1 milligram three times per day [<xref rid=""REF15"" ref-type=""bibr"">15</xref>]. Children are usually treated based on their weight and height. The dosage is incredibly important because if they are not carefully planned out, side effects can be devastating for the patient. An overdose of anticonvulsants can lead to serious issues such as central nervous system depression, ataxia, and nystagmus. In the studies encompassed in this review, many patients who were taking lamotrigine started off with smaller dosages such as 0.1-0.5 milligrams per kilogram of body weight per day [<xref rid=""REF16"" ref-type=""bibr"">16</xref>-<xref rid=""REF17"" ref-type=""bibr"">17</xref>]. The dosage of antiepileptic drugs also varies between adults and children. The usual adult dosage of antiepileptic drugs is 500-1000 milligrams twice a day. Many patients typically start off around 250 milligrams twice a day for a week, then increase by increments of 250 milligrams per week until the desired results are achieved. The dosage of antiepileptic drugs is also critical as it can heavily affect the patient. If too many antiepileptic drugs are ingested, serious complications such as respiratory depression, apnoea, coma, and ventricular arrhythmias can occur [<xref rid=""REF18"" ref-type=""bibr"">18</xref>]. Vitamin C dosage is also important to the overall health of the patient. The typical dosage of vitamin C is 5-75 milligrams for children, 75 milligrams for adult women, 90 milligrams for adult men, and 85-120 milligrams for women who are pregnant or breastfeeding [<xref rid=""REF19"" ref-type=""bibr"">19</xref>-<xref rid=""REF21"" ref-type=""bibr"">21</xref>]. Although an excessive amount of vitamin C is unlikely to be very harmful, overdose side effects include nausea, heartburn, insomnia, and abdominal pain [<xref rid=""REF22"" ref-type=""bibr"">22</xref>-<xref rid=""REF23"" ref-type=""bibr"">23</xref>]. One study in this review administered vitamin C at 14.3 milligrams/kilogram of body weight per day in conjunction with sodium selenite [<xref rid=""REF24"" ref-type=""bibr"">24</xref>]. Another set of experiments treated patients with 0.008-0.025 milligrams/kilogram of body weight per day [<xref rid=""REF25"" ref-type=""bibr"">25</xref>-<xref rid=""REF26"" ref-type=""bibr"">26</xref>]. One case study included in this review treated patients with vitamin C that was naturally made by the bodies of the patients with the recorded concentration: 103.6-148.7 micromoles per liter [<xref rid=""REF27"" ref-type=""bibr"">27</xref>].  Results of anticonvulsants The results of the treatment with anticonvulsants show some potential. In a study with 16 patients, they were treated with lamotrigine at a dosage of 0.5 milligram/kilogram of body weight for 15 patients, and one patient had their dose increased over two weeks to 4.7 milligrams/kilogram of body weight [<xref rid=""REF16"" ref-type=""bibr"">16</xref>]. Lamotrigine proved to help nearly all patients’ seizures for two years [<xref rid=""REF16"" ref-type=""bibr"">16</xref>]. Additionally, in another experiment in this review, lamotrigine was administered to 28 patients starting with dosages of 0.1-0.5 milligrams/kilogram of body weight per day, then increased every two weeks up to 1.25-15 milligrams/kilogram of body weight per day. The results showed that lamotrigine helped 23 out of the 28 patients [<xref rid=""REF17"" ref-type=""bibr"">17</xref>]. With a different setting, 60 patients were treated with anticonvulsants valproate, lamotrigine, phenobarbital, and felbamate Valproate was administered at 10 milligrams/kilogram of body weight per day, lamotrigine at 0.5 milligrams/kilogram of body weight per day, phenobarbital at 1 milligram/kilogram of body weight per day, and felbamate at 5-10 milligrams/kilogram of body weight per day [<xref rid=""REF28"" ref-type=""bibr"">28</xref>]. With the usage of different anticonvulsants, there was an overall 50% decrease in seizures. Clonazepam is another anticonvulsant that has been experimented with [<xref rid=""REF29"" ref-type=""bibr"">29</xref>-<xref rid=""REF30"" ref-type=""bibr"">30</xref>]. Zonisamide is an anticonvulsant that was given to patients in a study at 100-600 milligrams daily for two to three years and showed promise at effectively treating epilepsies [<xref rid=""REF31"" ref-type=""bibr"">31</xref>-<xref rid=""REF32"" ref-type=""bibr"">32</xref>]. One study combined anticonvulsants levetiracetam (1000 milligrams twice a day), sodium valproate (400 milligrams twice a day), lamotrigine (125 milligrams twice a day), zonisamide (100 milligrams in the morning, 150 milligrams at night), and diazepam (10 milligrams, given when required). For the next three months, the patient did not experience major seizure activity of sporadic jerks in the palms [<xref rid=""REF33"" ref-type=""bibr"">33</xref>]. Another example of combining anticonvulsants is one study that used barbiturates and valproate. The results showed that barbiturates caused erythrocyte ethanolamine phosphoglycerides and phosphatidylethanolamine plasmalogens to decrease, but the valproate treatment had no effect on erythrocyte ethanolamine phosphoglycerides and phosphatidylethanolamine plasmalogen levels [<xref rid=""REF34"" ref-type=""bibr"">34</xref>]. In a group experiment, 35 patients were treated with valproate given at 60-1000 milligrams daily. Valproate had a variety of effects, the most common being: valproate-induced hyperammonemic encephalopathy, drowsiness, and decreased seizures [<xref rid=""REF35"" ref-type=""bibr"">35</xref>]. In a different situation, valproate was again tested with patients, being administered at 63-75 milligrams/liter. In the patient who received the lower dose, there were only mild and intermittent effects on the Batten disease onset [<xref rid=""REF36"" ref-type=""bibr"">36</xref>]. In the other patient, there was only a mild reduction of symptoms [<xref rid=""REF36"" ref-type=""bibr"">36</xref>]. Anticonvulsants have also been shown to cause increased fluidity in membranes when membrane fluidity in juvenile Batten disease patients tends to be decreased [<xref rid=""REF37"" ref-type=""bibr"">37</xref>]. Valproic acid (VPA) is a derivative of valproate that was also experimented with as an anticonvulsant. In one assay, patients were treated with VPA at 15 milligrams/kilograms of body weight per day. Shortly after the first couple of treatments, there was a report of breakthrough seizure activity especially in the mornings, indicating treatment was unsuccessful [<xref rid=""REF38"" ref-type=""bibr"">38</xref>]. While there are multiple assays indicating that anticonvulsants serve as a treatment method for Batten disease successfully, there are others showing that anticonvulsants can fail at being effective [<xref rid=""REF39"" ref-type=""bibr"">39</xref>-<xref rid=""REF40"" ref-type=""bibr"">40</xref>]. For instance, phenytoin is an anticonvulsant that was tested, and the results show that phenytoin doesn’t cause a statistical difference in the activity of free radical metabolism of patients with Batten disease [<xref rid=""REF41"" ref-type=""bibr"">41</xref>]. However, since the majority of experiments indicated some level of success, it can be deduced that anticonvulsants could very well be a viable solution to Batten disease.  Results of antiepileptic drugs and vitamin C There is promising, yet limited (due to the criteria mentioned for studies encompassed in this piece of literature), evidence of the success of antiepileptic drugs in treating Batten disease as shown by Table <xref rid=""TAB1"" ref-type=""table"">1</xref>. One study combined the antiepileptic drugs amiodarone, cis diltiazem HCl, felodipine, flavoxate HCl, and isradipine. The effects from the treatment of multiple antiepileptic drugs simultaneously show significant lowering in calcium levels in ceroid lipofuscinosis, neuronal type 3 (CLN3) small interfering ribonucleic acid (siRNA) knockdown cells, which reduces defects in the CLN3 cells, leading to less presence of Batten disease [<xref rid=""REF42"" ref-type=""bibr"">42</xref>]. Vitamin C also shows possible capability in treating Batten disease. In one case, 74 patients were given vitamin C at 0.008-0.025 milligrams/kilogram of body weight per day. The effects on female patients were significant, as the treatment decreased menstruation periods in women, which correlated with a decrease in seizures [<xref rid=""REF25"" ref-type=""bibr"">25</xref>]. Another assay with vitamin C given at 0.008-0.025 milligrams/kilogram of body weight per day resulted in either no progress or only slight progress observed in mental/neurological symptoms of Batten disease [<xref rid=""REF26"" ref-type=""bibr"">26</xref>]. In one scenario, vitamin C that was naturally made by the bodies of the patients was used to observe its effects on neurological problems. The average concentration of vitamin C was 103.6-148.7 micromoles/liter. The results indicated that vitamin C levels are decreased in some patients who have neurological disorders like Batten disease [<xref rid=""REF27"" ref-type=""bibr"">27</xref>]. While results from antiepileptic drugs are limited and vitamin C has variable results, both show promise in becoming a commonplace treatment for Batten disease patients.  From all of the data of the experiments incorporated in this piece of literature, it is comprehensible that anticonvulsants can serve as a potential method to expand on our limited knowledge and treatment methods of Batten disease. Anticonvulsants are a valuable treatment method because of their ability, as demonstrated by the majority of the data, to stop epileptic seizures. Furthermore, antiepileptic drugs and vitamin C have also proved useful in the treatment of Batten disease. The concentration of vitamin C in the brain and neuroendocrine tissues have shown to make a difference in patients with Batten disease and is useful overall to the human nervous system, particularly the central nervous system. Antiepileptic drugs are helpful with seizures as they decrease membrane excitability by interacting with neurotransmitter receptors or ion channels. There is still much work to be done, especially with antiepileptic drugs and vitamin C, in doing more trials with different dosages, and obtaining more data with those treatment methods. Anticonvulsants, combined with vitamin C and antiepileptic drugs, could potentially serve as the backbone treatment for Batten disease. Further studies should be conducted with vitamin C, antiepileptic drugs, and anticonvulsants to understand their long-term effects on mitigating the neurological results of Batten disease.",N/A,30 1 2022
Altered protein secretion in Batten disease,"The neuronal ceroid lipofuscinoses (NCLs), collectively known as Batten disease, are a group of neurological diseases that affect all ages and ethnicities worldwide. There are 13 different subtypes of NCL, each caused by a mutation in a distinct gene. The NCLs are characterized by the accumulation of undigestible lipids and proteins in various cell types. This leads to progressive neurodegeneration and clinical symptoms including vision loss, progressive motor and cognitive decline, seizures, and premature death. These diseases have commonly been characterized by lysosomal defects leading to the accumulation of undigestible material but further research on the NCLs suggests that altered protein secretion may also play an important role. This has been strengthened by recent work in biomedical model organisms, including <italic toggle=""yes"">Dictyostelium discoideum,</italic> mice, and sheep. Research in <italic toggle=""yes"">D. discoideum</italic> has reported the extracellular localization of some NCL-related proteins and the effects of NCL-related gene loss on protein secretion during unicellular growth and multicellular development. Aberrant protein secretion has also been observed in mammalian models of NCL, which has allowed examination of patient-derived cerebrospinal fluid and urine for potential diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers. Accumulated evidence links seven of the 13 known NCL-related genes to protein secretion, suggesting that altered secretion is a common hallmark of multiple NCL subtypes. This Review highlights the impact of altered protein secretion in the NCLs, identifies potential biomarkers of interest and suggests that future work in this area can provide new therapeutic insight. <bold>Summary:</bold> This Review discusses work in different model systems and humans, examining the impact of altered protein secretion in the neuronal ceroid lipofuscinoses group of diseases to provide novel therapeutic insights.","The neuronal ceroid lipofuscinoses (NCLs) are a family of autosomal recessive (<xref rid=""DMM049152B1"" ref-type=""boxed-text"">Box 1</xref>) neurological diseases characterized by the accumulation of undigestible ceroid lipofuscin (<xref rid=""DMM049152B1"" ref-type=""boxed-text"">Box 1</xref>) in various cell types, which results in progressive neurodegeneration (<xref rid=""DMM049152C35"" ref-type=""bibr"">Cooper et al., 2015</xref>). Commonly known as Batten disease, the NCLs cause severe clinical symptoms, including vision loss, motor and cognitive decline, seizures, and premature death (<xref rid=""DMM049152C138"" ref-type=""bibr"">Radke et al., 2015</xref>). Although Batten disease affects all ages and ethnicities it is recognized as the most common form of neurodegeneration in children. There are 13 different subtypes of NCL that share broadly similar clinical and pathological profiles (<xref rid=""DMM049152C118"" ref-type=""bibr"">Nelvagal et al., 2020</xref>) but each subtype is caused by a mutation in a distinct gene (<xref rid=""DMM049152C21"" ref-type=""bibr"">Butz et al., 2020</xref>) (<xref rid=""DMM049152TB1"" ref-type=""table"">Table 1</xref>). The NCLs are commonly known as lysosomal storage diseases because of the lysosomal accumulation of ceroid lipofuscin. However, the precise functions of NCL-related genes and proteins, and the molecular and cellular mechanisms underlying the NCLs remain incompletely understood, which has motivated the use of a variety of model systems to provide clues into the biological processes affected by mutations in NCL-related genes (<xref rid=""DMM049152C73"" ref-type=""bibr"">Huber et al., 2020a</xref>; <xref rid=""DMM049152C110"" ref-type=""bibr"">Minnis et al., 2020</xref>). Early work on patient samples suggested the involvement of altered protein secretion in the NCLs (<xref rid=""DMM049152TB2"" ref-type=""table"">Table 2</xref>). This is consistent with neuronal signaling relying on the regulated secretion of proteins and other molecules (<xref rid=""DMM049152C31"" ref-type=""bibr"">Chung et al., 2016</xref>), and aberrant secretion being associated with neurodegeneration (<xref rid=""DMM049152C51"" ref-type=""bibr"">Gonçalves et al., 2016</xref>; <xref rid=""DMM049152C128"" ref-type=""bibr"">Pérez et al., 2016</xref>).

Most of the work in this area has focused on the role of <italic toggle=""yes"">D. discoideum</italic> Cln3, the homolog of human ceroid-lipofuscinosis neuronal 3 (CLN3) (<xref rid=""DMM049152TB1"" ref-type=""table"">Table 1</xref>), in regulating protein secretion during growth and the early stages of development (<xref rid=""DMM049152B1"" ref-type=""boxed-text"">Box 1</xref>) (<xref rid=""DMM049152F1"" ref-type=""fig"">Fig. 1</xref>). However, recent work on other <italic toggle=""yes"">D. discoideum</italic> NCL-related proteins suggests that altered secretion is a common hallmark of multiple NCL subtypes. This Review also evaluates recent work in mammalian models of NCL, which has examined how altered secretion in the NCLs can provide biomarkers for diagnosis and prognosis, as well as for monitoring therapy response. Overall, the aim of this Review is to highlight how studying aberrant protein secretion in the NCLs can complement existing approaches for tackling the disease, such as understanding lysosomal defects.
<boxed-text id=""DMM049152B2"" position=""float""><caption><title>Box 2. <italic toggle=""yes"">Dictyostelium discoideum</italic> as a model system to study the NCLs</title></caption><p>Many non-mammalian and mammalian models have been used to study the localization and function of NCL-related proteins, providing the foundation for our current understanding of NCL pathology (<xref rid=""DMM049152C74"" ref-type=""bibr"">Huber et al., 2020b</xref>). One such organism is the eukaryote <italic toggle=""yes"">D. discoideum</italic> (<xref rid=""DMM049152C105"" ref-type=""bibr"">McLaren et al., 2019</xref>), a soil microbe that has historically served as an excellent model system for studying conserved cellular and developmental processes (<xref rid=""DMM049152C101"" ref-type=""bibr"">Mathavarajah et al., 2017</xref>). More recently, <italic toggle=""yes"">D. discoideum</italic> has been used as a biomedical model to study a variety of human diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease (<xref rid=""DMM049152C150"" ref-type=""bibr"">Sharma et al., 2019</xref>), Huntington's disease (<xref rid=""DMM049152C115"" ref-type=""bibr"">Myre et al., 2011</xref>) and cancer (<xref rid=""DMM049152C104"" ref-type=""bibr"">Mathavarajah et al., 2021</xref>). The 34-megabyte <italic toggle=""yes"">D. discoideum</italic> genome has been estimated to encode ∼12,500 proteins (<xref rid=""DMM049152C46"" ref-type=""bibr"">Eichinger et al., 2005</xref>), including homologs of 11 of the 13 human proteins that are linked to the NCLs (<xref rid=""DMM049152C63"" ref-type=""bibr"">Huber, 2016</xref>). Among the many benefits of using <italic toggle=""yes"">D. discoideum</italic> to study protein function is its 24-h life cycle that comprises single-cell as well as multicellular phases (<xref rid=""DMM049152C101"" ref-type=""bibr"">Mathavarajah et al., 2017</xref>) (<xref rid=""DMM049152F1"" ref-type=""fig"">Fig. 1</xref>). Furthermore, cAMP – which was shown to be affected in a CLN3 disease mouse model (<xref rid=""DMM049152C2"" ref-type=""bibr"">Aldrich et al., 2016</xref>) – plays a central role in regulating <italic toggle=""yes"">D. discoideum</italic> development (<xref rid=""DMM049152C86"" ref-type=""bibr"">Kawabe et al., 2019</xref>) in a primitive neurotransmission-like scenario.

Importantly, research in <italic toggle=""yes"">D. discoideum</italic> has shown that NCL-related proteins have important roles in protein secretion – the focus of this Review.</p></boxed-text>
<boxed-text id=""DMM049152B3"" position=""float""><caption><title>Box 3. Protein secretion in <italic toggle=""yes"">D. discoideum</italic></title></caption><p>In <italic toggle=""yes"">D. discoideum</italic>, two mechanistically different pathways, are known to facilitate protein secretion. The first, the so-called conventional pathway, transports proteins through the ER and Golgi complex, where they are packaged into vesicles and finally secreted (<xref rid=""DMM049152C167"" ref-type=""bibr"">Viotti, 2016</xref>). Most proteins secreted via this pathway contain a secretion-signal peptide. The alternative unconventional pathway, which has been predicted to regulate the release of proteins that lack a secretion-signal peptide, involves the Golgi reassembly-stacking protein (GrpA) (<xref rid=""DMM049152B1"" ref-type=""boxed-text"">Box 1</xref>) (<xref rid=""DMM049152C90"" ref-type=""bibr"">Kinseth et al., 2007</xref>) and contractile vacuole (CV) system (<xref rid=""DMM049152B1"" ref-type=""boxed-text"">Box 1</xref>) (<xref rid=""DMM049152C149"" ref-type=""bibr"">Sesaki et al., 1997</xref>).

 Previous studies used liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry (LC–MS/MS) to show that ≥3% of proteins encoded by the <italic toggle=""yes"">D. discoideum</italic> genome are secreted, with the caveat that some of the detected proteins could have been from lysed cells or surface proteins that were released from the plasma membrane during sample collection (<xref rid=""DMM049152C6"" ref-type=""bibr"">Bakthavatsalam and Gomer, 2010</xref>; <xref rid=""DMM049152C64"" ref-type=""bibr"">Huber, 2017</xref>). Gene ontology (GO) term enrichment analysis (<xref rid=""DMM049152B1"" ref-type=""boxed-text"">Box 1</xref>) showed that many of the secreted proteins are involved in metabolic and proteolytic processes. One route for secreted proteins is their deposition into the extracellular matrix (ECM). Following mound formation in <italic toggle=""yes"">D. discoideum</italic>, cells secrete material that eventually forms the slime sheath (i.e. the ECM) of the migrating slug (<xref rid=""DMM049152C70"" ref-type=""bibr"">Huber and O'Day, 2017</xref>) (<xref rid=""DMM049152F1"" ref-type=""fig"">Fig. 1</xref>). LC–MS/MS has been used to identify >300 proteins in the slime sheath (<xref rid=""DMM049152C69"" ref-type=""bibr"">Huber and O'Day, 2015</xref>). GO term analysis of the identified sheath proteins revealed an enrichment of proteins involved in binding, metabolism, catalysis and proteolysis. Together, these findings highlight our extensive knowledge of secreted proteins in <italic toggle=""yes"">D. discoideum</italic>. Combined with the genetic tractability of <italic toggle=""yes"">D. discoideum</italic>, they also demonstrate the ability to use <italic toggle=""yes"">D. discoideum</italic> to examine the effect of gene loss or mutation on targeted and global protein secretion. Proteomics-based approaches revealed that <italic toggle=""yes"">D. discoideum</italic> homologs of five of the 11 human NCL-related proteins are secreted during <italic toggle=""yes"">D. discoideum</italic> development; these are the homologs of human palmitoyl protein thioesterase 1 (PPT1; <italic toggle=""yes"">D. discoideum</italic> Ppt1), tripeptidyl peptidase 1 (TPP1; <italic toggle=""yes"">D. discoideum</italic> Tpp1B, Tpp1C, Tpp1F), ceroid lipofuscinosis neuronal 5 (CLN5; <italic toggle=""yes"">D. discoideum</italic> Cln5), cathepsin D (CTSD; <italic toggle=""yes"">D. discoideum</italic> CtsD) and cathepsin F (CTSF; <italic toggle=""yes"">D. discoideum</italic> CprA, CprB, CprD, CprE, CprF, CprG, uncharacterized protein DDB0252831) (<xref rid=""DMM049152C6"" ref-type=""bibr"">Bakthavatsalam and Gomer, 2010</xref>; <xref rid=""DMM049152C64"" ref-type=""bibr"">Huber, 2017</xref>; <xref rid=""DMM049152C66"" ref-type=""bibr"">Huber and Mathavarajah, 2018a</xref>,<xref rid=""DMM049152C67"" ref-type=""bibr"">b</xref>) (<xref rid=""DMM049152TB1"" ref-type=""table"">Table 1</xref>). CLN5, CTSD and CTSF have also been detected extracellularly in mammals (<xref rid=""DMM049152C136"" ref-type=""bibr"">Poole et al., 1973</xref>; <xref rid=""DMM049152C78"" ref-type=""bibr"">Isosomppi et al., 2002</xref>; <xref rid=""DMM049152C76"" ref-type=""bibr"">Hughes et al., 2014</xref>; <xref rid=""DMM049152C121"" ref-type=""bibr"">Öörni et al., 2004</xref>; <xref rid=""DMM049152C82"" ref-type=""bibr"">Kaakinen et al., 2007</xref>) and recent work identified PPT1 and TPP1 in human saliva (<xref rid=""DMM049152C92"" ref-type=""bibr"">Kohan et al., 2005</xref>). In addition, previous work has confirmed that PPT1 (<xref rid=""DMM049152C99"" ref-type=""bibr"">Lyly et al., 2007</xref>), TPP1 (<xref rid=""DMM049152C123"" ref-type=""bibr"">Pal et al., 2009</xref>), and CLN5 (<xref rid=""DMM049152C112"" ref-type=""bibr"">Moharir et al., 2013)</xref> and CTSD (<xref rid=""DMM049152C47"" ref-type=""bibr"">Erickson et al., 1981</xref>) are glycosylated, which is a key attribute of secreted proteins. The glycosylation (<xref rid=""DMM049152B1"" ref-type=""boxed-text"">Box 1</xref>) of CTSF has not been previously studied. Consistent with these findings, the bioinformatic tool <uri http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink href=""https://services.healthtech.dtu.dk/service.php?SignalP-5.0"">SignalP 5.0</uri> (<xref rid=""DMM049152C3"" ref-type=""bibr"">Almagro Armenteros et al., 2019</xref>) detects putative secretion-signal peptides within human PPT1, TPP1, CLN5, CTSD and CTSF as well as the corresponding <italic toggle=""yes"">D. discoideum</italic> homologs. In mammals, the NCL-related protein progranulin (GRN) (<xref rid=""DMM049152TB1"" ref-type=""table"">Table 1</xref>) also contains a putative secretion-signal peptide, is glycosylated and has been detected extracellularly (<xref rid=""DMM049152C183"" ref-type=""bibr"">Zhou et al., 1993</xref>). However, its <italic toggle=""yes"">D. discoideum</italic> homolog granulin (Grn), which also contains a putative secretion-signal peptide, has not been detected outside the cell (<xref rid=""DMM049152C6"" ref-type=""bibr"">Bakthavatsalam and Gomer, 2010</xref>; <xref rid=""DMM049152C69"" ref-type=""bibr"">Huber and O'Day, 2015</xref>; <xref rid=""DMM049152C64"" ref-type=""bibr"">Huber, 2017</xref>), suggesting that extracellular Grn is unstable or binds to the cell surface shortly after being secreted. In addition to their extracellular localization, all these NCL-related proteins also localize to lysosomes where they function as enzymes (<xref rid=""DMM049152C26"" ref-type=""bibr"">Cárcel-Trullols et al., 2015</xref>; <xref rid=""DMM049152C66"" ref-type=""bibr"">Huber and Mathavarajah, 2018a</xref>). These observations support previous work reporting the detection of lysosomal enzymes outside the cell and their emerging roles in disease development and progression (<xref rid=""DMM049152C168"" ref-type=""bibr"">Vizovišek et al., 2019</xref>), suggesting that secreted NCL-related proteins function extracellularly. The detection of extracellular cathepsins (<xref rid=""DMM049152B1"" ref-type=""boxed-text"">Box 1</xref>) in <italic toggle=""yes"">D. discoideum</italic> (<xref rid=""DMM049152C6"" ref-type=""bibr"">Bakthavatsalam and Gomer, 2010</xref>; <xref rid=""DMM049152C64"" ref-type=""bibr"">Huber, 2017</xref>), i.e. homologs of human CTSB, CTSD and CTSF, is also consistent with the importance of cathepsin activity in NCL pathology. For example, cathepsin activity is altered in leukocytes and cultured skin fibroblasts from CLN2 disease (<xref rid=""DMM049152B1"" ref-type=""boxed-text"">Box 1</xref>) patients (<xref rid=""DMM049152C12"" ref-type=""bibr"">Bennett et al., 1992</xref>), as well as in <italic toggle=""yes"">CLN3</italic>-depleted HeLa cells (<xref rid=""DMM049152C107"" ref-type=""bibr"">Metcalf et al., 2008</xref>). Whereas the roles of secreted NCL-related proteins are not entirely clear, their detection outside cells indicates that they have important extracellular functions. Mutations in <italic toggle=""yes"">CLN5</italic> primarily cause a late infantile-onset form of NCL known as CLN5 disease (<xref rid=""DMM049152C113"" ref-type=""bibr"">Mole and Cotman, 2015</xref>). However, juvenile (<xref rid=""DMM049152C25"" ref-type=""bibr"">Cannelli et al., 2007</xref>) and adult (<xref rid=""DMM049152C176"" ref-type=""bibr"">Xin et al., 2010</xref>) cases have also been reported. In mammals, CLN5 is thought to localize primarily to the lysosome (<xref rid=""DMM049152C78"" ref-type=""bibr"">Isosomppi et al., 2002</xref>; <xref rid=""DMM049152C112"" ref-type=""bibr"">Moharir et al., 2013</xref>; <xref rid=""DMM049152C76"" ref-type=""bibr"">Hughes et al., 2014</xref>). However, it has also been detected extracellularly in baby hamster kidney cells (<xref rid=""DMM049152C78"" ref-type=""bibr"">Isosomppi et al., 2002</xref>) and mixed neural cells from <italic toggle=""yes"">Cln5</italic>-deficient sheep (<xref rid=""DMM049152C76"" ref-type=""bibr"">Hughes et al., 2014</xref>). In <italic toggle=""yes"">D. discoideum</italic>, Cln5 is found in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), at punctate distributions in the cytoplasm, in the contractile vacuole (CV) system, at the cell periphery and extracellularly (<xref rid=""DMM049152C66"" ref-type=""bibr"">Huber and Mathavarajah, 2018a</xref>,<xref rid=""DMM049152C67"" ref-type=""bibr"">b</xref>) (<xref rid=""DMM049152F2"" ref-type=""fig"">Fig. 2</xref>). Secretion of Cln5 in <italic toggle=""yes"">D. discoideum</italic> has been well studied, and has fostered new speculation into the localization and function of human CLN5. In <italic toggle=""yes"">D. discoideum</italic>, secretion of Cln5 is regulated by at least two other NCL-related proteins, Cln3 (<xref rid=""DMM049152C64"" ref-type=""bibr"">Huber, 2017</xref>; <xref rid=""DMM049152C67"" ref-type=""bibr"">Huber and Mathavarajah, 2018b</xref>) and major facilitator superfamily domain-containing protein 8 (Mfsd8), loss of which increases Cln5 secretion (<xref rid=""DMM049152F2"" ref-type=""fig"">Fig. 2</xref>) (<xref rid=""DMM049152C74"" ref-type=""bibr"">Huber et al., 2020b</xref>). Mfsd8 is the <italic toggle=""yes"">D. discoideum</italic> homolog of human MFSD8 (<xref rid=""DMM049152TB1"" ref-type=""table"">Table 1</xref>) and mutations in <italic toggle=""yes"">MFSD8</italic> cause CLN7 disease (<xref rid=""DMM049152B1"" ref-type=""boxed-text"">Box 1</xref>) (<xref rid=""DMM049152TB1"" ref-type=""table"">Table 1</xref>). In addition, recent work suggests that <italic toggle=""yes"">D. discoideum</italic> Cln5 is secreted following induction of autophagy via an unconventional pathway involving the CV system (<xref rid=""DMM049152C67"" ref-type=""bibr"">Huber and Mathavarajah, 2018b</xref>; <xref rid=""DMM049152C106"" ref-type=""bibr"">McLaren et al., 2021</xref>) (<xref rid=""DMM049152F2"" ref-type=""fig"">Fig. 2</xref>). Although the primary function of autophagy is to break down and recycle intracellular material, mounting evidence suggests it also participates in conventional and unconventional protein secretion (<xref rid=""DMM049152C119"" ref-type=""bibr"">New and Thomas, 2019</xref>; <xref rid=""DMM049152C28"" ref-type=""bibr"">Cavalli and Cenci, 2020</xref>; <xref rid=""DMM049152C122"" ref-type=""bibr"">Padmanabhan and Manjithaya, 2020</xref>). While the mechanisms regulating autophagy-dependent secretion are not fully understood, autophagy (ATG) genes (<xref rid=""DMM049152B1"" ref-type=""boxed-text"">Box 1</xref>), autophagosomes (<xref rid=""DMM049152B1"" ref-type=""boxed-text"">Box 1</xref>) and multivesicular bodies (<xref rid=""DMM049152B1"" ref-type=""boxed-text"">Box 1</xref>) are thought to play important roles (<xref rid=""DMM049152C44"" ref-type=""bibr"">Duran et al., 2010</xref>; <xref rid=""DMM049152C100"" ref-type=""bibr"">Manjithaya et al., 2010</xref>; <xref rid=""DMM049152C30"" ref-type=""bibr"">Chen et al., 2017</xref>). Consistent with these findings, pharmacological treatment (ammonium chloride or chloroquine) or deletion of ATG genes (<italic toggle=""yes"">atg1<sup>−</sup></italic> or <italic toggle=""yes"">atg9<sup>−</sup></italic>) reduce Cln5 secretion in <italic toggle=""yes"">D. discoideum</italic> (<xref rid=""DMM049152C67"" ref-type=""bibr"">Huber and Mathavarajah, 2018b</xref>; <xref rid=""DMM049152C106"" ref-type=""bibr"">McLaren et al., 2021</xref>). In addition, the functions of <italic toggle=""yes"">D. discoideum</italic> Cln5 (<xref rid=""DMM049152C106"" ref-type=""bibr"">McLaren et al., 2021</xref>), mouse CLN5 (<xref rid=""DMM049152C95"" ref-type=""bibr"">Leinonen et al., 2017</xref>), sheep CLN5 (<xref rid=""DMM049152C13"" ref-type=""bibr"">Best et al., 2017</xref>) and human CLN5 (<xref rid=""DMM049152C1"" ref-type=""bibr"">Adams et al., 2019</xref>; <xref rid=""DMM049152C43"" ref-type=""bibr"">Doccini et al., 2020</xref>) have all been linked to autophagy. Another important regulator of <italic toggle=""yes"">D. discoideum</italic> Cln5 secretion is glycosylation (<xref rid=""DMM049152C67"" ref-type=""bibr"">Huber and Mathavarajah, 2018b</xref>); and, in human cells, CLN5 mislocalizes to the Golgi complex when glycosylation is inhibited (<xref rid=""DMM049152C112"" ref-type=""bibr"">Moharir et al., 2013</xref>). Moreover, recent work revealed that <italic toggle=""yes"">D. discoideum</italic> Cln5 and human CLN5 have glycoside hydrolase activity (<xref rid=""DMM049152C66"" ref-type=""bibr"">Huber and Mathavarajah, 2018a</xref>), and accumulated evidence suggests that CLN5 and the well-studied glycoside hydrolase β-hexosaminidase subunit alpha (HEXA) participate in the same biological pathway (<xref rid=""DMM049152C66"" ref-type=""bibr"">Huber and Mathavarajah, 2018a</xref>; <xref rid=""DMM049152C106"" ref-type=""bibr"">McLaren et al., 2021</xref>). In <italic toggle=""yes"">D. discoideum</italic>, the HEXA-like proteins N-acetylglucosaminidase A and B (NagA and NagB, respectively), are secreted during development (<xref rid=""DMM049152C6"" ref-type=""bibr"">Bakthavatsalam and Gomer, 2010</xref>; <xref rid=""DMM049152C64"" ref-type=""bibr"">Huber, 2017</xref>). Collectively, these observations indicate that additional work is necessary to resolve the primary localization of CLN5 in humans, and whether it functions in lysosomes, extracellularly or both.

This was confirmed by a follow-up study that reported altered secretion of several cysteine proteases by <italic toggle=""yes"">cln3<sup>−</sup></italic> cells (<xref rid=""DMM049152C64"" ref-type=""bibr"">Huber, 2017</xref>). <italic toggle=""yes"">cln3</italic> deficiency also increases the intracellular amount of counting factor-associated protein D (CfaD) during the early log phase of axenic growth (<xref rid=""DMM049152C71"" ref-type=""bibr"">Huber et al., 2014</xref>) (<xref rid=""DMM049152F3"" ref-type=""fig"">Fig. 3</xref>). CfaD is like cathepsin L (CTSL) from various species and part of an extracellular complex that binds AprA (<xref rid=""DMM049152C7"" ref-type=""bibr"">Bakthavatsalam et al., 2008</xref>).

Intriguingly, recent work has also revealed how loss of <italic toggle=""yes"">tpp1</italic> (<xref rid=""DMM049152C157"" ref-type=""bibr"">Smith et al., 2019</xref>) or <italic toggle=""yes"">cln5</italic> (<xref rid=""DMM049152C106"" ref-type=""bibr"">McLaren et al., 2021</xref>) affects cell proliferation, suggesting that altered protein secretion also underlies growth stage phenotypes in these knockout cell lines. However, in <italic toggle=""yes"">tpp1<sup>−</sup></italic> and <italic toggle=""yes"">cln5<sup>−</sup></italic> cell lines, proliferation is reduced not increased, suggesting that NCL-related proteins serve different regulatory functions during <italic toggle=""yes"">D. discoideum</italic> growth.

These findings, coupled with the effect of <italic toggle=""yes"">cln3</italic> deficiency on AprA secretion and cleavage during growth, suggest that the delayed aggregation is due to <italic toggle=""yes"">cln3<sup>−</sup></italic> cells not being primed to enter the developmental program owing to alterations in cell–cell signaling. <italic toggle=""yes"">cln3</italic> deficiency also reduces cell–cell and cell–substrate adhesion (<xref rid=""DMM049152C72"" ref-type=""bibr"">Huber et al., 2017</xref>), both of which are essential for aggregation during the early stages of development. The <italic toggle=""yes"">D. discoideum</italic> genome encodes the well-characterized calcium-dependent cell-adhesion protein A (CadA), which shares limited sequence similarity with classic cadherins (<xref rid=""DMM049152C91"" ref-type=""bibr"">Knecht et al., 1987</xref>; <xref rid=""DMM049152C175"" ref-type=""bibr"">Wong et al., 1996</xref>; <xref rid=""DMM049152C18"" ref-type=""bibr"">Brar and Siu, 1993</xref>). During development, CadA is secreted by the CV system (<xref rid=""DMM049152C149"" ref-type=""bibr"">Sesaki et al., 1997</xref>; <xref rid=""DMM049152C6"" ref-type=""bibr"">Bakthavatsalam and Gomer, 2010</xref>; <xref rid=""DMM049152C159"" ref-type=""bibr"">Sriskanthadevan et al., 2013</xref>; <xref rid=""DMM049152C64"" ref-type=""bibr"">Huber, 2017</xref>) and present in the slug ECM (<xref rid=""DMM049152C69"" ref-type=""bibr"">Huber and O'Day, 2015</xref>). High amounts of extracellular CadA have anti-adhesive effects (<xref rid=""DMM049152C154"" ref-type=""bibr"">Siu et al., 1997</xref>) and, during aggregation, <italic toggle=""yes"">cln3</italic> deficiency increases the extracellular amount of CadA (<xref rid=""DMM049152C72"" ref-type=""bibr"">Huber et al., 2017</xref>) (<xref rid=""DMM049152F3"" ref-type=""fig"">Fig. 3</xref>), suggesting that loss of <italic toggle=""yes"">cln3</italic> reduces the amount of membrane-tethered CadA, thus compromising adhesion. Deficiency of <italic toggle=""yes"">cln3</italic> also reduces cAMP-mediated chemotaxis (<xref rid=""DMM049152C72"" ref-type=""bibr"">Huber et al., 2017</xref>). When starved, <italic toggle=""yes"">D. discoideum</italic> cells produce and secrete cAMP, which acts as a chemoattractant for multicellular aggregation (<xref rid=""DMM049152C101"" ref-type=""bibr"">Mathavarajah et al., 2017</xref>). Although loss of <italic toggle=""yes"">cln3</italic> has no effect on the expression or localization of cAMP signal transduction proteins (<xref rid=""DMM049152C64"" ref-type=""bibr"">Huber, 2017</xref>), it does affect the expression and intracellular amount of AprA (<xref rid=""DMM049152C68"" ref-type=""bibr"">Huber and Mathavarajah, 2019</xref>), which functions as a chemorepellent during development (<xref rid=""DMM049152C131"" ref-type=""bibr"">Phillips and Gomer, 2012</xref>). Therefore, in addition to cell proliferation, the reduced chemotaxis of <italic toggle=""yes"">cln3<sup>−</sup></italic> cells might also be linked to altered levels of AprA. Intriguingly, recent work reported chemotaxis, adhesion and aggregation defects for <italic toggle=""yes"">cln5<sup>−</sup></italic> cells (<xref rid=""DMM049152C67"" ref-type=""bibr"">Huber and Mathavarajah, 2018b</xref>; <xref rid=""DMM049152C106"" ref-type=""bibr"">McLaren et al., 2021</xref>), along with an altered extracellular amount of CadA (<xref rid=""DMM049152C106"" ref-type=""bibr"">McLaren et al., 2021</xref>). Together, these findings provide additional evidence that link NCL-related gene loss to aberrant protein secretion during <italic toggle=""yes"">D. discoideum</italic> development and suggest that protein secretion is, indeed, altered in multiple NCL subtypes. RNA sequencing was used to determine the effects of <italic toggle=""yes"">cln3</italic> deficiency on gene expression during aggregation of <italic toggle=""yes"">D. discoideum</italic> (<xref rid=""DMM049152C68"" ref-type=""bibr"">Huber and Mathavarajah, 2019</xref>). GO term analysis identified enrichment of differentially expressed genes encoding proteins that localize to the cell periphery, plasma membrane and extracellular space. In Cln3-deficient cells, RNA sequencing also revealed reduced expression of genes encoding Rab11B, syntaxin 1B, vacuolin B and vacuole membrane protein 1 (Vmp1), all of which are associated with secretion (<xref rid=""DMM049152C68"" ref-type=""bibr"">Huber and Mathavarajah, 2019</xref>). Interestingly, Vmp1 shares many attributes with Cln3, including localization to the Golgi complex and CV system, and functioning in cell proliferation, aggregation and osmoregulation (<xref rid=""DMM049152C23"" ref-type=""bibr"">Calvo-Garrido et al., 2008</xref>, <xref rid=""DMM049152C24"" ref-type=""bibr"">2014</xref>; <xref rid=""DMM049152C22"" ref-type=""bibr"">Calvo-Garrido and Escalante, 2010</xref>). GO term enrichment analysis also revealed enrichment of differentially expressed genes linked to catalytic activity (<xref rid=""DMM049152C68"" ref-type=""bibr"">Huber and Mathavarajah, 2019</xref>). For example, <italic toggle=""yes"">cln3</italic> deficiency decreases the expression of genes encoding the lysosomal enzymes beta-glucosidase, alpha-mannosidase and N-acetylglucosaminidase (<xref rid=""DMM049152C68"" ref-type=""bibr"">Huber and Mathavarajah, 2019</xref>). Loss of <italic toggle=""yes"">cln3</italic> also reduces the intracellular activity of beta-glucosidase and alpha-mannosidase, and increases the extracellular activity of those enzymes as well as N-acetylglucosaminidase (<xref rid=""DMM049152C68"" ref-type=""bibr"">Huber and Mathavarajah, 2019</xref>) (<xref rid=""DMM049152F3"" ref-type=""fig"">Fig. 3</xref>), suggesting that <italic toggle=""yes"">cln3<sup>−</sup></italic> cells increase secretion of these lysosomal enzymes. Based on these observations, it might be that cells reduce the expression of genes that encode beta-glucosidase, alpha-mannosidase and N-acetylglucosaminidase, to counteract the increased secretion and extracellular activity of these enzymes. The trafficking and secretion of lysosomal enzymes has been well studied in <italic toggle=""yes"">D. discoideum</italic>. During growth and aggregation, <italic toggle=""yes"">D. discoideum</italic> secretes precursor and mature forms of lysosomal enzymes including beta-glucosidase, alpha-mannosidase, and N-acetylglucosaminidase (<xref rid=""DMM049152C42"" ref-type=""bibr"">Dimond et al., 1981</xref>; <xref rid=""DMM049152C109"" ref-type=""bibr"">Mierendorf et al., 1985</xref>; <xref rid=""DMM049152C27"" ref-type=""bibr"">Cardelli et al., 1990</xref>). The release of lysosomal enzymes is due to an active secretory process, not passive leakage of enzymes from cells or their incidental release during the egestion of digested material (<xref rid=""DMM049152C42"" ref-type=""bibr"">Dimond et al., 1981</xref>). Previous work suggests that sorting of secreted and intracellular pools of lysosomal enzymes occurs in the Golgi complex (<xref rid=""DMM049152C109"" ref-type=""bibr"">Mierendorf et al., 1985</xref>), and that protease activity is required for trafficking enzymes to lysosomes (<xref rid=""DMM049152C139"" ref-type=""bibr"">Richardson et al., 1988</xref>). Intriguingly, Cln3 localizes to the Golgi complex in <italic toggle=""yes"">D. discoideum</italic> and influences the secretion of several lysosomal enzymes (<xref rid=""DMM049152C64"" ref-type=""bibr"">Huber, 2017</xref>). These findings suggest that loss of <italic toggle=""yes"">cln3</italic> affects the cleavage of precursor forms of lysosomal enzymes, and/or the sorting of secreted and intracellular pools of lysosomal enzymes at the Golgi complex. Thus, work on Cln3 has provided new insight on the mechanisms that regulate lysosomal enzyme secretion. Overall, comparative transcriptomics has provided further support for a role of Cln3 in protein secretion, and suggests that altered secretion plays an important role in the development and progression of CLN3 disease. An LC–MS/MS analysis of <italic toggle=""yes"">cln3<sup>−</sup></italic> conditioned buffer (<xref rid=""DMM049152B1"" ref-type=""boxed-text"">Box 1</xref>) solidified the role of Cln3 in protein secretion during aggregation (<xref rid=""DMM049152C64"" ref-type=""bibr"">Huber, 2017</xref>). GO term analysis revealed an extracellular enrichment of proteins associated with vesicle-mediated transport, endocytosis, proteolysis and metabolism. Among the affected proteins are the <italic toggle=""yes"">D. discoideum</italic> homologs of human TPP1 (Tpp1F, increased), CLN5 (Cln5, increased), CTSD (CtsD, increased), CTSF (CprA, decreased; CprB, decreased; CprD, increased; CprE, increased; CprF, increased; CprG, increased), CTSB (CtsB, increased), and HEXA (NagB, increased) (<xref rid=""DMM049152C64"" ref-type=""bibr"">Huber, 2017</xref>). Loss of <italic toggle=""yes"">cln3</italic> also reduces the expression and intracellular activity of CtsD and increases CtsD activity in conditioned buffer (<xref rid=""DMM049152C68"" ref-type=""bibr"">Huber and Mathavarajah, 2019</xref>) (<xref rid=""DMM049152F3"" ref-type=""fig"">Fig. 3</xref>), suggesting increased secretion of this cathepsin. These findings suggest that <italic toggle=""yes"">cln3<sup>−</sup></italic> cells compensate for the increased secretion and extracellular activity of CtsD by reducing <italic toggle=""yes"">ctsD</italic> expression. In addition, <italic toggle=""yes"">cln3</italic> deficiency increases TPP1 activity in conditioned buffer (<xref rid=""DMM049152C68"" ref-type=""bibr"">Huber and Mathavarajah, 2019</xref>), which aligns with an increased amount of Tpp1F outside <italic toggle=""yes"">cln3<sup>−</sup></italic> cells (<xref rid=""DMM049152C64"" ref-type=""bibr"">Huber, 2017</xref>) (<xref rid=""DMM049152F3"" ref-type=""fig"">Fig. 3</xref>). These findings are consistent with the previously described effects of <italic toggle=""yes"">cln3</italic> deficiency on the expression of genes encoding lysosomal enzymes (<xref rid=""DMM049152C68"" ref-type=""bibr"">Huber and Mathavarajah, 2019</xref>). Previous work in <italic toggle=""yes"">D. discoideum</italic> showed that enzymes secreted during the early stages of development facilitate adhesion and aggregation (<xref rid=""DMM049152C144"" ref-type=""bibr"">Rossomando et al., 1978</xref>; <xref rid=""DMM049152C42"" ref-type=""bibr"">Dimond et al., 1981</xref>; <xref rid=""DMM049152C45"" ref-type=""bibr"">Ebert et al., 1990</xref>). Therefore, the combined effect of <italic toggle=""yes"">cln3</italic> deficiency on the expression and secretion of lysosomal enzymes might contribute to the reduced adhesion and delayed aggregation of <italic toggle=""yes"">cln3</italic>-deficient cells (<xref rid=""DMM049152C72"" ref-type=""bibr"">Huber et al., 2017</xref>). Accumulated evidence suggests that <italic toggle=""yes"">cln3</italic> deficiency deregulates protein secretion, since several proteins that are not normally secreted by wild-type (WT) cells can be detected in <italic toggle=""yes"">cln3<sup>−</sup></italic> conditioned buffer (<xref rid=""DMM049152C6"" ref-type=""bibr"">Bakthavatsalam and Gomer, 2010</xref>; <xref rid=""DMM049152C69"" ref-type=""bibr"">Huber and O'Day, 2015</xref>; <xref rid=""DMM049152C64"" ref-type=""bibr"">Huber, 2017</xref>) and most aberrantly secreted proteins are present at increased, not decreased, amounts in conditioned buffer (<xref rid=""DMM049152C64"" ref-type=""bibr"">Huber, 2017</xref>). In support of this hypothesis, our group reported an enrichment of downregulated genes in <italic toggle=""yes"">cln3<sup>−</sup></italic> cells, whose protein products localize extracellularly (<xref rid=""DMM049152C68"" ref-type=""bibr"">Huber and Mathavarajah, 2019</xref>). This observation could reflect the cell downregulating the expression of genes whose protein products are present extracellularly at abnormally high levels. Recent work in <italic toggle=""yes"">D. discoideum</italic> suggests that multiple NCL-related proteins may function in protein secretion. As discussed previously, Cln5 and CtsD are glycosylated and secreted during <italic toggle=""yes"">D. discoideum</italic> development (<xref rid=""DMM049152C66"" ref-type=""bibr"">Huber and Mathavarajah, 2018a</xref>,<xref rid=""DMM049152C67"" ref-type=""bibr"">b</xref>; <xref rid=""DMM049152C81"" ref-type=""bibr"">Journet et al., 1999</xref>), which aligns with observations of secreted CLN5 and CTSD in mammals (<xref rid=""DMM049152C78"" ref-type=""bibr"">Isosomppi et al., 2002</xref>; <xref rid=""DMM049152C76"" ref-type=""bibr"">Hughes et al., 2014</xref>; <xref rid=""DMM049152C136"" ref-type=""bibr"">Poole et al., 1973</xref>) (<xref rid=""DMM049152TB1"" ref-type=""table"">Table 1</xref>). Like <italic toggle=""yes"">cln3<sup>−</sup></italic> cells, loss of <italic toggle=""yes"">mfsd8</italic> in <italic toggle=""yes"">D. discoideum</italic> also increases the secretion of Cln5 (<xref rid=""DMM049152F2"" ref-type=""fig"">Fig. 2</xref>) and CtsD (<xref rid=""DMM049152C74"" ref-type=""bibr"">Huber et al., 2020b</xref>). The effects of <italic toggle=""yes"">mfsd8</italic> deficiency on protein secretion in <italic toggle=""yes"">D. discoideum</italic> are consistent with the role of MFSD8 in lysosome exocytosis observed in an immortalized cell line generated from cerebellar granule neuron precursors (<xref rid=""DMM049152B1"" ref-type=""boxed-text"">Box 1</xref>) isolated from <italic toggle=""yes"">Cln7<sup>−/−</sup></italic> mice (<xref rid=""DMM049152C169"" ref-type=""bibr"">von Kleist et al., 2019</xref>). In addition, like <italic toggle=""yes"">cln3<sup>−</sup></italic> cells, loss of <italic toggle=""yes"">cln5</italic> in <italic toggle=""yes"">D. discoideum</italic> also affects the amount of CadA outside the cell, which is thought to play a role in the chemotaxis, adhesion and aggregation defects observed for <italic toggle=""yes"">cln5<sup>−</sup></italic> cells (<xref rid=""DMM049152C106"" ref-type=""bibr"">McLaren et al., 2021</xref>). In mammals, recent findings associate DNAJC5 – which causes CLN4 disease (<xref rid=""DMM049152B1"" ref-type=""boxed-text"">Box 1</xref>) when mutated (<xref rid=""DMM049152C113"" ref-type=""bibr"">Mole and Cotman, 2015</xref>) – with misfolding-associated protein secretion (<xref rid=""DMM049152B1"" ref-type=""boxed-text"">Box 1</xref>) (<xref rid=""DMM049152C177"" ref-type=""bibr"">Xu et al., 2018</xref>). In addition, loss of <italic toggle=""yes"">TPP1</italic> in a canine model of CLN2 disease damages cells, causing the release of cardiac troponin-1, alanine aminotransferase and creatine kinase into blood plasma (<xref rid=""DMM049152C85"" ref-type=""bibr"">Katz et al., 2017</xref>). Combined, these findings suggest that multiple NCL-related proteins regulate protein secretion, which, ultimately, might play an important role in the development and progression of the NCLs. Most NCL patients receive their diagnosis only after the first symptoms are detected. For childhood diseases, such as the NCLs, newborn or infantile diagnosis may present an opportunity to administer therapies that prevent or slow down disease progression. The classic diagnosis for NCL involves microscopic analysis of a skin biopsy for accumulation of ceroid lipofuscin (<xref rid=""DMM049152C171"" ref-type=""bibr"">Williams et al., 2006</xref>). Genetic testing and enzyme activity assays are also available for NCL subtypes caused by loss of a specific lysosomal enzyme (e.g. TPP1 activity in CLN2 disease). Unfortunately, existing tests cannot monitor disease progression or the patients' responses to treatment. Based on these limitations, studies in animal models and humans have begun to explore the protein content of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and urine to identify potential diagnostic, prognostic and therapeutic-response biomarkers, which could also help to optimize dosage for patients undergoing treatment. Some of the findings from these studies align with observations in <italic toggle=""yes"">D. discoideum</italic>, strongly supporting the role of aberrant protein secretion in NCL pathology. The sections below describe recent studies of altered protein secretion in animal models, followed by a discussion of similar work using human samples. Collectively, these studies have laid the foundation for future work to identify and validate potential NCL biomarkers. NCL diagnosis can range from congenital (e.g. CLN10 disease, mutations in <italic toggle=""yes"">CTSD</italic>) to juvenile (e.g. CLN3 disease, mutations in <italic toggle=""yes"">CLN3</italic>) and adult (e.g. CLN4 disease, mutations in <italic toggle=""yes"">DNAJC5</italic>). Whereas many NCL-related proteins function as lysosomal enzymes, others are proposed to regulate intracellular trafficking and transport across membranes (<xref rid=""DMM049152C26"" ref-type=""bibr"">Cárcel-Trullols et al., 2015</xref>), which could explain the range of disease onset observed across the 13 subtypes of NCL. Mutations in essential lysosomal enzymes, i.e. CTSD, are likely to cause ceroid lipofuscin to accumulate at an increased rate and, thus, accelerate disease onset. However, other NCL-related proteins that participate in alternative pathological mechanisms – as for example, CLN3, which is not a lysosomal enzyme but, rather, plays a role in protein secretion – or whose cellular function can be partially restored by other proteins, would be associated with a more delayed disease onset. An important question to consider is the precise role of altered protein secretion in NCL pathology. Is it a secondary effect of NCL-causing mutations or does it cause the accumulation of ceroid lipofuscin directly? If the former, studying altered protein secretion in the NCLs has clinical value for the development of biomarkers for NCL diagnosis, prognosis and therapy evaluation. However, if the latter, further studies of how aberrant protein secretion impacts NCL pathology is warranted to better understand how secretory pathways could be targeted therapeutically. For example, increased enzyme secretion in the NCLs might deplete lysosomes of essential enzymes required to degrade internalized material, resulting in the accumulation of this material within lysosomes. It might also disrupt intracellular signaling by affecting the structure and/or composition of the ECM (<xref rid=""DMM049152C126"" ref-type=""bibr"">Parker and Kohler, 2010</xref>). Additionally, mutations in NCL-related genes might affect the secretion of extracellular proteins that bind the cell surface to modulate signaling pathways regulating intracellular trafficking (<xref rid=""DMM049152C158"" ref-type=""bibr"">Soh et al., 2010</xref>). Another explanation for altered extracellular protein profiles in the NCLs could be cell death. However, this seems unlikely because not all lysosomal enzymes are detected in abnormal amounts outside cellular models or in extracellular fluid (e.g. CSF, urine). The exact functions of NCL-related proteins outside the cell are also not entirely clear. Since all secreted NCL-related proteins, except GRN, function as enzymes inside the cell, they perhaps also function as enzymes outside cells. In support of this hypothesis, previous work in <italic toggle=""yes"">D. discoideum</italic> detected TPP1 and CTSD activity in conditioned buffer (<xref rid=""DMM049152C68"" ref-type=""bibr"">Huber and Mathavarajah, 2019</xref>) (<xref rid=""DMM049152F3"" ref-type=""fig"">Fig. 3</xref>). In addition, several pieces of evidence suggest that CLN5 functions as a glycoside hydrolase outside the cell (<xref rid=""DMM049152C66"" ref-type=""bibr"">Huber and Mathavarajah, 2018a</xref>,<xref rid=""DMM049152C67"" ref-type=""bibr"">b</xref>; <xref rid=""DMM049152C106"" ref-type=""bibr"">McLaren et al., 2021</xref>). To confirm these hypotheses, the activities of secreted NCL-related proteins will need to be experimentally validated. By contrast, although it is known that some newly synthesized lysosomal proteins are secreted (<xref rid=""DMM049152C77"" ref-type=""bibr"">Ibata and Yuzaki, 2021</xref>), the extracellular presence of NCL-related proteins could indicate a trafficking defect where a mutation causes extracellular trafficking of the protein instead of lysosome localization. Thus, the presence of these proteins outside the cell could serve as a biomarker for the NCLs. Recent work regarding spinal cord injury and neurodegeneration indicates that enzymes released into the ECM through lysosomal exocytosis degrade the ECM, so that neurons can secrete new building blocks to rebuild synapses (<xref rid=""DMM049152C77"" ref-type=""bibr"">Ibata and Yuzaki, 2021</xref>). In addition, stimulating lysosomal exocytosis has been proposed as a therapeutic approach for clearing the cell of accumulated material in lysosomal storage diseases (<xref rid=""DMM049152C161"" ref-type=""bibr"">Tancini et al., 2020</xref>). These observations, coupled with the findings summarized in this Review, suggest that mutations in NCL-related genes affect the secretion of material required to rebuild synapses or disturb secretory pathways associated with lysosomal exocytosis, which provides further insight into NCL pathology and potential therapeutic opportunities. This Review discussed the extracellular localization of several NCL-related proteins and highlighted findings that link seven of the 13 known NCL-related genes (<italic toggle=""yes"">PPT1</italic>, <italic toggle=""yes"">TPP1</italic>, <italic toggle=""yes"">CLN3</italic>, <italic toggle=""yes"">DNAJC5</italic>, <italic toggle=""yes"">CLN5</italic>, <italic toggle=""yes"">CLN6</italic>, <italic toggle=""yes"">MFSD8</italic>) to the secretion of other proteins. Work in <italic toggle=""yes"">D. discoideum</italic> shows that NCL-related gene deficiency affects protein secretion, consequently impacting various cellular and developmental processes during the life cycle. Loss of homologs of NCL-related genes in <italic toggle=""yes"">D. discoideum</italic> (e.g. <italic toggle=""yes"">cln3</italic>) also affects the secretion of proteins that are aberrantly secreted in mammalian models of NCL and NCL patients (e.g. CTSB, CTSD, HEXA, HEXB). These findings support the continued use of <italic toggle=""yes"">D. discoideum</italic> to assess the impact of mutations and altered protein secretion on fundamental cellular and developmental processes. In addition, although the aberrant secretion of proteins in different NCL models is intriguing, recent work also detected aberrant levels of metabolites in CSF obtained from CLN2 disease patients, suggesting that small molecules also serve as effective biomarkers (<xref rid=""DMM049152C152"" ref-type=""bibr"">Sindelar et al., 2018</xref>). Finally, accumulated evidence indicates that the unconventional secretion of cellular material is likely to underlie other neurological diseases, including Alzheimer's (i.e. tau protein; <xref rid=""DMM049152C182"" ref-type=""bibr"">Zhang et al., 2021</xref>) and Parkinson's disease (i.e. alpha-synuclein; <xref rid=""DMM049152C116"" ref-type=""bibr"">Nakamura et al., 2021</xref>), suggesting that protein secretion pathways are viable therapeutic targets for multiple forms of neurodegeneration. Together, this Review highlights the impact of NCL-causing mutations on protein secretion and sets the stage for future studies to explore the roles of NCL-related proteins in secretion, which will provide new therapeutic insights regarding this devastating neurological disease.

"Utilizing telehealth to create a clinical model of care for patients
with Batten disease and other rare diseases","The COVID-19 pandemic transformed the delivery of healthcare across the world.
Telehealth has emerged as the primary method for providing healthcare early in
the pandemic. Patient and healthcare provider views of the effectiveness of
telehealth services are encouraging and support the long-term use of telehealth
services in clinical practice. Telehealth may provide a strategy that has
far-reaching benefits for diverse patient populations, such as patients with
Batten disease and other rare diseases, who face additional barriers to
accessing subspecialty healthcare services. The aims of this paper, through the
experience of a single Batten Disease Center of Excellence, are to (1) review
the benefits and barriers involved in the delivery of telehealth services to
patients with rare diseases; (2) discuss components of a model for clinical care
that utilizes telehealth services for patients with Batten disease; (3) discuss
limitations and future directions of using telehealth in patients with rare
diseases. Healthcare systems should consider building clinical models that
utilize telehealth services to provide multidisciplinary services to patients
with rare diseases. There are numerous benefits in using telehealth that can
enhance and expand service delivery between the patient and clinician.
Telehealth services can also improve provider-to-provider communication and
collaboration when providing clinical care to individuals with rare diseases.
Although there are many benefits to utilizing telehealth services in provision
of care to patients with rare diseases, it is important to consider factors that
may limit or add additional barriers prior to implementing telehealth services.
There is a need for future collaborative research to examine and compare the
effectiveness and outcomes of telehealth services with standard of care services
that are provided in-person. Future research should also examine how to reduce
the challenges and barriers associated with the implementation of telehealth
services.","The World Health Organization declared a pandemic in March 2020 due to the rising
number of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2 or COVID-19)
cases. The transmission of the COVID-19 virus occurs during person-to-person
contact; therefore, a key factor in slowing the spread of the virus includes the
practice of social distancing. Consequently, many health organizations had to modify
their standard of care across patient and clinical care services during the pandemic
to slow the spread of the virus by reducing or canceling non-essential in-person
appointments and procedures.<sup><xref rid=""bibr2-26330040211038564"" ref-type=""bibr"">2</xref></sup> The use of telehealth services has been paramount in

to (1) review the benefits and barriers involved in the delivery of telehealth
services to patients with rare diseases; (2) discuss components of a model for
clinical care that utilizes telehealth services for patients with Batten disease;
(3) discuss limitations and future directions of using telehealth in patients with
rare diseases. To accomplish these aims, the authors have reviewed current
literature utilizing <italic toggle=""yes"">PubMed</italic> and <italic toggle=""yes"">Web of Science</italic> of
telehealth care delivery between 2010 and 2021. The proposed clinical model is based
on a single center experience of a Batten Disease Center of Excellence, in which
pediatric patients with Batten disease and their caregivers come from the United
States, Europe, and South America. Patients are evaluated within a multidisciplinary
model that includes a team of specialists from the disciplines of pediatric
neurology, physical therapy, occupational therapy, speech therapy, psychology, and
social work. Batten disease, or neuronal ceroid lipofuscinoses, includes a class of lysosomal
storage inherited disorders that are neurodegenerative and fatal. The gene defects
associated with Batten disease disrupt the cell’s lysosomal functioning and ability
for the cell to recycle molecules. There are 13 genotypic forms of Batten disease
that are characterized by mutations on different genes that can vary in disease
onset and severity of symptoms.<sup><xref rid=""bibr6-26330040211038564"" ref-type=""bibr"">6</xref></sup> Batten disease is a rare

involves ongoing assessment and treatment across multidisciplinary healthcare
providers. Disruption in healthcare services can add to increased family stress, as
well as potentially adverse developmental and medical outcomes, given the
pervasiveness of symptom presentation and nature of disease progression.
Unfortunately, the unique and ongoing needs that patients with Batten disease and
their families face are not exclusive of other populations with rare diseases. In
the United States, a disease is characterized as rare if it affects about 1 in 2000
people.<sup><xref rid=""bibr15-26330040211038564"" ref-type=""bibr"">15</xref></sup> Although, the authors of this manuscript reference patients
with Batten disease in the models and considerations proposed below, the
applications are likely able to be broadly applied to other populations with rare
diseases. It can be challenging to access evidence-based clinical services across patient
populations; however, unique and additional barriers exist in the field of rare
diseases.<sup><xref rid=""bibr16-26330040211038564"" ref-type=""bibr"">16</xref></sup> Individuals with rare diseases have heterogeneous etiologies
that are often chronic and fatal. In comparison with common diseases, there is a
paucity of research and guidance for clinical practice in rare diseases. Bell and
Smith<sup><xref rid=""bibr17-26330040211038564"" ref-type=""bibr"">17</xref></sup> analyzed characteristics of interventional trials and found
that of the 24,000 trials categorized as part of their study only 11.5% were rare
diseases trials. Research guides clinical practice; therefore, it is alarming and
unfortunate that individuals with rare diseases are underrepresented in clinical
research trials. Listed below are additional barriers and challenges to accessing
clinical services that individuals and families of patients with rare diseases may
experience: Telemedicine services can be an effective way to deliver care outside of emergency
situations. The US Department of Health Resources and Services
Administrations<sup><xref rid=""bibr1-26330040211038564"" ref-type=""bibr"">1</xref></sup> defines telehealth as the “use of electronic information and
telecommunication technologies to support long-distance clinical healthcare, patient
and professional health-related education, public health, and health administration.
Technologies include video conference, the internet, store-and-forward imaging,
streaming media, and terrestrial and wireless communication.” Telehealth services
can be classified into both provider-to-patient and provider-to-provider
communications, through the use of e-consults, remote patient monitoring,
patient-initiated messaging, telephone visits, and video visits.<sup><xref rid=""bibr2-26330040211038564"" ref-type=""bibr"">2</xref></sup> There are

services in clinical medicine, including: Although there are many benefits in delivering telehealth services to patients with
rare diseases that are highlighted above, there are a few limitations that warrant
consideration before employing telehealth services. Barriers to delivering
telehealth services are highlighted below, as well as listed in <xref rid=""table1-26330040211038564"" ref-type=""table"">Table 1</xref>: When developing clinical service delivery systems for telehealth it is important to
consider foundational questions of healthcare delivery through the lens of
telehealth. The first question that needs to be considered is how patients with rare
diseases may benefit from telehealth services. Telehealth services can be utilized
for many clinical purposes, including parent education, symptom management,
developmental assessment and monitoring services, and direct intervention.
Considerations likely will need to be individualized for each healthcare
organization and patient needs; however, the following clinical model may provide
guidance when developing a framework to deliver telehealth services. In Batten disease, children and young adults are ideally managed through a
multidisciplinary neurology clinic. Williams and colleagues<sup><xref rid=""bibr14-26330040211038564"" ref-type=""bibr"">14</xref></sup> identified
four domains of services in the management of Batten disease: medical, quality of
life, family support, and end-of-life care. Once diagnosed, there are immediate
needs for parent education and service coordination, as well as family centered
emotional support. Long-term symptom management involves management of seizures,
cognitive deterioration, management of nutrition, and pulmonary concerns. Given the
neurodegenerative nature of Batten disease, repeated cognitive assessments are
necessary to monitor skill regression. Developmental therapies are also conducted in
an attempt to maintain skills and facilitate development as possible. Allied health
services including physical, occupational, and speech therapy are necessary to
support recommendations for local services. Some of these services, such as
developmental monitoring, developmental therapies, and some medication consultation,
can be completed partially or completely through telehealth. However, other
procedures, especially direct medical interventions or laboratory work (e.g. blood
draws), cannot be completed through telehealth. The decision of which elements of a
clinical process can be implemented over a telehealth system is a first step toward
creating a model of care. It is also important to consider the requirements that must be satisfied to implement
telehealth services. Procedures and protocols may vary across institutions, but it
is important to keep patient safety and confidentiality in mind when establishing
telehealth services. Chowdhury and colleagues<sup><xref rid=""bibr31-26330040211038564"" ref-type=""bibr"">31</xref></sup> provide guidance for
performing telehealth services and suggest obtaining written or verbal consent from
the patient or parent prior to arranging the telehealth encounter. It is also
important to have compliance with HIPAA and utilize a modality that is secure and
offers a platform that allows direct communication to the patient. Organizations
should consider integration of telehealth services into the patient’s electronic
medical record that allow multiple providers to be present at the appointment and to
have access to patient information, scheduling, billing, and insurance
information.<sup><xref rid=""bibr31-26330040211038564"" ref-type=""bibr"">31</xref></sup> It is also important to consider technology infrastructure
(e.g. access to broadband, computers/tablets, software, cameras, and microphones)
and familiarity in using technology platforms for both providers and
patients.<sup><xref rid=""bibr32-26330040211038564"" ref-type=""bibr"">32</xref></sup> A strength of telehealth service delivery is that it reduces some barriers of
multidisciplinary work, namely, conducting appointments over video conferences
reduces the facility needs of large multidisciplinary teams and eases some
scheduling challenges that arise from many busy practitioners having to be
co-located in order to have multidisciplinary clinics. Clinic teams for rare genetic
diseases are generally led by a medical provider who acts as the team
lead.<sup><xref rid=""bibr12-26330040211038564"" ref-type=""bibr"">12</xref></sup> Teams consist of medical providers, nursing staff,
psychologists, physical therapists, occupational therapists, speech therapists,
social workers, and other neurodevelopmental professionals. When adapting these
teams to telehealth, it will be important for team members to spend some time
outlining their individual practices. This allows teams to identify possible
redundancies across disciplines and create a virtual clinic flow. Team appointments
over telehealth allow multiple providers to observe a child’s behavior at the same
time, which can reduce the tasks demands placed on a child during an appointment. In
order to take advantage of this opportunity, the team should think actively and
flexibly about how best to order activities throughout the clinic. Developing a clinic team for a given rare genetic disease will always require
individual consideration. In our institution, a multidisciplinary approach to Batten
disease as a center of excellence has the following components: An evaluation begins with developmental, medical, and behavioral history. Given the
team nature of the evaluation, this assessment can be conducted with all team
members present for efficiency. The interview is led by the team physician, who
focuses on elucidating the primary goals of the assessment, medical history, and
current medical needs. Each subsequent team member can then add necessary questions
from the perspective of their discipline. This process allows a comprehensive
history to be taken for the team’s consideration, without subjecting caregivers to
multiple providers’ repeated questions. Each discipline conducts specific testing and evaluation practices based on their
evidence-based practice. We recommend reviewing medical records to allow the team to
prioritize the complex medical needs of each patient. This allows the team to
consult with one another and communicate areas of assessment that might be needed by
each team member. Comprehensive assessment generally includes testing a patient’s
cognitive or developmental functioning, language skills, and motor functioning.
Caregivers may also complete structured or semi-structured interviews, as well as
rating scales, to provide a comprehensive view of the child in multiple settings and
from multiple perspectives. These assessments also allow the team neurologist to
observe the child’s development with each member of the evaluating team. After each
individual testing session is completed the team can conference to decide potential
diagnoses and preliminary treatment course. Finally, feedback is given to the family
with any appropriate diagnoses, a plan for necessary medical testing orders, and
recommendations for any necessary developmental, behavioral, or educational
intervention. This evaluation process can provide a robust understanding of their
child’s development and a comprehensive plan for future care. There are careful considerations that should be made when designing a battery for
remote testing. When a patient’s developmental skills are evaluated in-person during
a clinical visit, the clinician has an opportunity to directly elicit developmental
skills in a carefully controlled environment using standardized assessment.
Developmental skills can also be assessed through telehealth by caregiver
questionnaires and interviews evaluating adaptive and developmental functioning.
Certain cognitive and neuropsychological assessment measures can also be reliably
performed <italic toggle=""yes"">via</italic> telehealth.<sup><xref rid=""bibr34-26330040211038564"" ref-type=""bibr"">34</xref>,<xref rid=""bibr35-26330040211038564"" ref-type=""bibr"">35</xref></sup> Consideration for specific
cognitive domains, such as attention or memory, should be given when assessing
<italic toggle=""yes"">via</italic> telehealth. For example, the quality of the audio, as well
as distractions in the testing environment may be difficult to manage. Cognitive and
developmental assessments and other methods (e.g. caregiver report, behavioral
observations) conducted through telehealth can guide recommendations for treatment
and intervention efforts. When completing assessments remotely, it is especially important to consider
historical sources of information that may describe a child’s developmental
functioning. Previous evaluations may have been completed for local early
intervention services. These previous evaluations can help build an understanding of
a child’s functioning, as well as provide a baseline with which current observations
of development can be compared. For clinics where assessments are going to be
consistently completed in other areas, it is beneficial to develop relationships
with local providers who can work in partnership with the team to facilitate direct
assessment of the child’s developmental skills. When choosing assessment measures for telehealth developmental assessment, it is
important to consider how likely it will be to be able to get a direct sample of the
skill being assessed over video conferencing and the standardization of the testing
instrument being used. To date, no direct tests of child development have been
developed to be administered in a telehealth setting. However, there is a growing
evidence base of studies that some tests, including the Weschler Intelligence Scale
– Fifth Edition (WISC-5)<sup><xref rid=""bibr36-26330040211038564"" ref-type=""bibr"">36</xref></sup> and the Woodcock Johnson Cognitive Abilities-Fourth
Edition,<sup><xref rid=""bibr37-26330040211038564"" ref-type=""bibr"">37</xref></sup> have equivalency over telehealth services. Similarly, verbally
based tests have been shown to yield equivalent results over telehealth
platforms.<sup><xref rid=""bibr38-26330040211038564"" ref-type=""bibr"">38</xref></sup> This would suggest that some assessment of language skills,

and direct behavior assessment can be performed. In these cases, assessments will
have to be conducted through a combination of parent report and informal observation
of developmental milestones. There are multiple developmental measures that are
normed using parent report, including developmental assessments [e.g., Developmental
Profile-Fourth Edition (DP-4), language assessments (Receptive-Expressive Emergent

indirect assessment and improve the decisions that are made based on those indirect
assessments. In cases where traditional direct assessment of skills is not possible,
it will be important to choose developmental tests that allow for indirect parent

verbally, utilizing the DP-4, REEL, and/or Vineland-3 will allow clinicians to
obtain standardized ratings of child development. When paired with direct behavior
observations, the multidisciplinary team will be able to make informed
recommendations regarding the child’s treatment and educational needs. Although telehealth serves most naturally as an avenue for briefer forms of
consultation, the COVID-19 pandemic has ushered in a significant increase in
telehealth treatment services. It is possible for therapy services to be completed
over telehealth models.<sup><xref rid=""bibr47-26330040211038564"" ref-type=""bibr"">47</xref>,<xref rid=""bibr48-26330040211038564"" ref-type=""bibr"">48</xref></sup> The telehealth model allows the children access to the allied

Although the literature base is still evolving, there is evidence that therapy for

effective.<sup><xref rid=""bibr49-26330040211038564"" ref-type=""bibr"">49</xref></sup> Direct therapy with the children with rare diseases over telehealth may be
challenging depending on the developmental level of the child or medical
complexities associated with their disease. Parent-mediated intervention can be a
viable option to delivery treatment and consultation services. Parent training
models of treatment have been found to be effective to increase the rate of a
child’s learning across multiple domains of functioning. Parent training models of

developmental disabilities is challenging in rural communities.<sup><xref rid=""bibr51-26330040211038564"" ref-type=""bibr"">51</xref></sup> In Batten
disease, children have complex medical issues including cognitive, visual, and
physical limitations. Consultative services that could be conducted over telehealth
include educational services to help families understand their child’s specialized
instruction through the school. Educational consultation could also be used to
advocate for some proactive considerations for visual impairment, to help children
learn skills such as braille or using a cane. Speech consultation services could
also be used to help a family and treating speech therapy provider to consider and
implement functional communication strategies or an augmentative and alternative
communication system. Medical consultation services are frequently used to adjust or
reconsider medical interventions. Behavioral consultation services are used to
manage emergent disruptive or maladaptive behaviors, as well as working with
occupational therapy consultation to increase functional independence. Telehealth
consultation services can also be considered as a means to monitor or enhance
services between in-person clinic visits. The use of targeted consultation services
is one of the ways in which services can be delivered in novel and creative ways to
increase the quality of overall care that a child receives. Healthcare systems should consider building standardized clinical models that utilize
telehealth services to provide services to patients with rare diseases. There are
numerous benefits in using telehealth that can enhance and expand service delivery
between the patient and clinician. Telehealth services can also improve
provider-to-provider communication and collaboration when providing clinical care to
individuals with rare diseases. Although there are many benefits to utilizing
telehealth services in provision of care to patients with rare diseases, it is
important to consider factors that may limit or add additional barriers prior to
implementing telehealth services. It is also critical to consider security and
privacy when choosing telehealth platforms that protect private patient

receive appropriate education and training; (2) introduce telehealth accreditation
for professionals; (3) provide funding which adequately covers that cost of
providing telehealth services; (4) redesign clinical models of care; (5) support all
stakeholders with an effective communication and change management strategy; and (6)
establish system to manage telehealth services on a routine basis. There is a need for future research to examine and compare the effectiveness and
outcomes of telehealth services with standard-of-care or specialized services that
are provided in-person. Clinical outcomes that should be considered are costs,
patient experiences and satisfaction, provider experiences and satisfaction, disease
or health outcomes, and feasibility. Additionally, future work should focus on
challenges associated with the implementation of telehealth services, including
reducing barriers previously discussed, as well as the practicality of utilizing
telehealth services. Telehealth continues to be a promising avenue to deliver

"An Unusual Presentation of <italic toggle=""yes"">CLN3</italic>-Associated Batten Disease With Classic Histopathologic and Ultrastructural Findings",,Full text not available in PMC,N/A,11 2021
The converging roles of Batten disease proteins in neurodegeneration and cancer,"Epidemiological studies have reported an inverse correlation between cancer and neurodegenerative disorders, and increasing evidence shows that similar genes and pathways are dysregulated in both diseases but in a contrasting manner. Given the genetic convergence of the neuronal ceroid lipofuscinoses (NCLs), a family of rare neurodegenerative disorders commonly known as Batten disease, and other neurodegenerative diseases, we sought to explore the relationship between cancer and the NCLs. In this review, we survey data from The Cancer Genome Atlas and available literature on the roles of NCL genes in different oncogenic processes to reveal links between all the NCL genes and cancer-related processes. We also discuss the potential contributions of NCL genes to cancer immunology. Based on our findings, we propose that further research on the relationship between cancer and the NCLs may help shed light on the roles of NCL genes in both diseases and possibly guide therapy development.  Cancer; Clinical Neuroscience; Neurogenetics; Neuroscience","Neurons are terminally differentiated cells that are relatively quiescent and non-replicative (<xref rid=""bib62"" ref-type=""bibr"">Houck et al., 2018</xref>). An accumulation of misfolded proteins within neurons causes cellular toxicity and contributes to premature neuronal death (i.e., neurodegeneration) as seen in diseases such as Parkinson's disease (PD) and Alzheimer's disease (AD). In contrast, cancer is characterized by rapid cell proliferation and the avoidance of cell death (<xref rid=""bib55"" ref-type=""bibr"">Hanahan and Weinberg, 2017</xref>). In accordance with their distinct characteristics, epidemiological data show an inverse relationship between cancer and neurodegeneration, although there are some exceptions (e.g., PD with malignant melanoma) (<xref rid=""bib62"" ref-type=""bibr"">Houck et al., 2018</xref>). Nevertheless, there is mounting evidence suggesting that common genes and pathways are dysregulated in both diseases but in a contrasting manner (<xref rid=""bib62"" ref-type=""bibr"">Houck et al., 2018</xref>; <xref rid=""bib72"" ref-type=""bibr"">Klus et al., 2015</xref>). Causative genes in neurodegenerative diseases, such as <italic toggle=""yes"">PARK2</italic>, are aberrantly expressed or mutated in cancer (<xref rid=""bib62"" ref-type=""bibr"">Houck et al., 2018</xref>). In addition, meta-analyses from genome-wide association studies show that the genetic overlap between AD and cancers occurs due to the regulation of gene expression with respect to enhancer activity (<xref rid=""bib43"" ref-type=""bibr"">Feng et al., 2017</xref>). Interestingly, more than 60% of AD-associated genes are linked to cancer, with the intersecting genes regulating cell growth, innate immunity, and detoxification (<xref rid=""bib62"" ref-type=""bibr"">Houck et al., 2018</xref>). Consistent with these findings, the physico-chemical properties of the overlapping cancer and neurodegenerative proteins are altered dissimilarly, whereby genes upregulated in AD encode more structurally disordered proteins compared to cancer genes (<xref rid=""bib72"" ref-type=""bibr"">Klus et al., 2015</xref>). In total, these studies reinforce a shared gene network in neurodegeneration and cancer, indicating the importance of understanding how the shared genes are dysregulated in both diseases. The neuronal ceroid lipofuscinoses (NCLs), commonly known as Batten disease, are a family of neurodegenerative lysosomal storage disorders that affect all ethnicities and ages (<xref rid=""bib94"" ref-type=""bibr"">Mole and Cotman, 2015</xref>). Batten disease has a worldwide distribution with estimated incidence rates ranging from 2 to 13 of 100,000 live births (<xref rid=""bib145"" ref-type=""bibr"">Williams, 2011</xref>). Patients suffer from progressive vision loss, mental deterioration, seizures, motor deficits, and a shortened life span (<xref rid=""bib121"" ref-type=""bibr"">Schulz et al., 2013</xref>). The pathological cellular hallmarks of Batten disease include neuronal degeneration and the accumulation of autofluorescent lipofuscin in the lysosomes of neurons, especially in the cerebral cortex, cerebellum, and retina (<xref rid=""bib109"" ref-type=""bibr"">Radke et al., 2015</xref>). As of 2020, a total of 493 germline mutations in 13 distinct genes (<italic toggle=""yes"">CLN1-CLN8, CLN10-CLN14</italic>) have been reported in the NCL mutation database (<ext-link ext-link-type=""uri"" http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink href=""https://www.ucl.ac.uk/drupal/site_ncl-disease/mutation-and-patient-database"" id=""intref0010"">https://www.ucl.ac.uk/drupal/site_ncl-disease/mutation-and-patient-database</ext-link>). Each gene is associated with a different subtype of NCL (<xref rid=""bib94"" ref-type=""bibr"">Mole and Cotman, 2015</xref>). A recent study showed that mutations in the <italic toggle=""yes"">TBCK</italic> (TBC1 domain-containing kinase) gene present characteristics and clinical pathology that resemble other NCL subtypes, and thus, may be classified as a new NCL subtype, CLN15 disease (<xref rid=""bib8"" ref-type=""bibr"">Beck-Wödl et al., 2018</xref>). The NCL family of proteins comprises soluble lysosomal enzymes (CLN1/PPT1, palmitoyl protein thioesterase 1; CLN2/TPP1, tripeptidyl peptidase 1; CLN5, ceroid lipofuscinosis neuronal 5; CLN10/CTSD, cathepsin D; CLN13/CTSF, cathepsin F), lysosomal transmembrane proteins (CLN3, ceroid lipofuscinosis neuronal 3; CLN7/MFSD8, major facilitator superfamily domain-containing 8; CLN12/ATP13A2, ATPase 13A2), proteins associated with vesicular membranes (CLN4/DNAJC5, DnaJ heat shock protein family member C5; CLN14/KCTD7, potassium channel tetramerization domain-containing 7), membrane proteins that reside in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) (CLN6, ceroid lipofuscinosis neuronal 6; CLN8, ceroid lipofuscinosis neuronal 8) and a secreted glycoprotein (CLN11/PGRN, progranulin) (<xref rid=""bib16"" ref-type=""bibr"">Cárcel-Trullols et al., 2015</xref>). Despite the molecular genetic heterogeneity of these proteins, research in non-mammalian and mammalian models suggests that the NCL proteins may participate in shared or converging pathways (<xref rid=""bib63"" ref-type=""bibr"">Huber, 2020</xref>; <xref rid=""bib102"" ref-type=""bibr"">Persaud-Sawin et al., 2007</xref>). However, the precise functions of NCL proteins, their interactions with one another, and the underlying mechanisms that lead to NCL pathology are poorly understood, which has severely hindered therapy development. No previous studies have examined the relationship between cancer and the NCLs despite the genetic convergence of the NCLs and other neurodegenerative diseases (e.g., AD and PD) (<xref rid=""bib9"" ref-type=""bibr"">Benes et al., 2008</xref>; <xref rid=""bib69"" ref-type=""bibr"">Kao et al., 2017</xref>). In this review, we explore the roles of NCL genes in different oncogenic processes and identify similarities between cancer and the NCLs by examining the underlying genes and pathways. Next, we discuss the potential roles of NCL genes in cancer immunology. In total, this review aims to provide a better understanding of the genetic similarities shared by neurodegeneration and cancer, which may aid in the usage of NCL genes as potential biomarkers and prognostic indicators.   This review highlights the shared nature of genes and pathways associated with cancer and the NCLs. In the scientific literature, there is evidence of genetic alterations in NCL genes in cancer for <italic toggle=""yes"">CLN1</italic> to <italic toggle=""yes"">CLN5</italic> and <italic toggle=""yes"">CLN10</italic> to <italic toggle=""yes"">CLN13</italic> (summarized in <xref rid=""tbl1"" ref-type=""table"">Table 1</xref>). Cell cycle regulation, Ras and PI3K signaling pathways, apoptosis, and lysosome-associated functions such as autophagy and lysosomal pH regulation appear to be common links between both diseases. Despite our analyses in <xref rid=""fig1"" ref-type=""fig"">Figures 1</xref>, <xref rid=""fig2"" ref-type=""fig"">2</xref>, and <xref rid=""fig3"" ref-type=""fig"">3</xref> showing genetic perturbations in <italic toggle=""yes"">CLN6</italic>, <italic toggle=""yes"">MFSD8</italic>, <italic toggle=""yes"">CLN8</italic>, and <italic toggle=""yes"">KCTD7</italic> across various tumors and their influence on patient prognosis with respect to brain cancer, the specific roles of these genes in cancer-related processes has yet to be explored in detail. However, the pathways regulated by these genes also encompass pathways that are shared between cancer and the NCLs (e.g., ceramide pathway and protein homeostasis) (<xref rid=""bib16"" ref-type=""bibr"">Cárcel-Trullols et al., 2015</xref>; <xref rid=""bib63"" ref-type=""bibr"">Huber, 2020</xref>; <xref rid=""bib102"" ref-type=""bibr"">Persaud-Sawin et al., 2007</xref>). These findings indicate their possible involvement in oncogenesis and should be investigated further. In conclusion, more in-depth investigations on the distinct and shared molecular mechanisms between the NCLs and cancer can provide a better understanding of both diseases. Such research will improve our understanding of NCL protein function and regulation, as well as the pathways they participate in. It will also be of clinical interest to further examine the potential of NCL genes to serve as biomarkers and therapeutic targets in cancer.",N/A,19 3 2021
A human model of Batten disease shows role of CLN3 in phagocytosis at the photoreceptor–RPE interface,"Mutations in <italic toggle=""yes"">CLN3</italic> lead to photoreceptor cell loss in CLN3 disease, a lysosomal storage disorder characterized by childhood-onset vision loss, neurological impairment, and premature death. However, how <italic toggle=""yes"">CLN3</italic> mutations cause photoreceptor cell death is not known. Here, we show that CLN3 is required for phagocytosis of photoreceptor outer segment (POS) by retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) cells, a cellular process essential for photoreceptor survival. Specifically, a proportion of CLN3 in human, mouse, and iPSC-RPE cells localized to RPE microvilli, the site of POS phagocytosis. Furthermore, patient-derived CLN3 disease iPSC-RPE cells showed decreased RPE microvilli density and reduced POS binding and ingestion. Notably, POS phagocytosis defect in CLN3 disease iPSC-RPE cells could be rescued by wild-type <italic toggle=""yes"">CLN3</italic> gene supplementation. Altogether, these results illustrate a novel role of CLN3 in regulating POS phagocytosis and suggest a contribution of primary RPE dysfunction for photoreceptor cell loss in CLN3 disease that can be targeted by gene therapy. CLN3 disease is characterised by childhood-onset vision loss and premature death. Using patient-derived retinal cells, the authors show that CLN3 is required for retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) cell structure, microvilli and phagocytosis of photoreceptor outer segments that are essential for vision. They further suggest that gene-therapy targeting RPE cells can be effective for CLN3 disease.","Neuronal ceroid lipofuscinoses (NCLs) describes a group of genetically distinct neurodegenerative lysosomal storage diseases that involve excessive accumulation of lipofuscin. Juvenile NCL (JNCL) can be caused by mutations in <italic toggle=""yes"">CLN3</italic> (CLN3-Batten, CLN3 disease). CLN3 disease, the most common form of NCL, presents in early childhood with vision loss as the first clinical feature, followed some years later by progressive neurological dysfunction and ultimately premature death<sup><xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR1"">1</xref>–<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR7"">7</xref></sup>. Although it is well established that retinal damage is responsible for vision loss in CLN3 disease, the primary cellular and molecular mechanisms leading to retinal degeneration in CLN3 disease are not known. This is partly due to limited and conflicting data on CLN3 localization and function in the retina<sup><xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR2"">2</xref>,<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR8"">8</xref>–<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR11"">11</xref></sup>, and lack of a suitable model system that recapitulates the human disease phenotype. Furthermore, clinical and histopathologic studies have shown the involvement of multiple retinal cell layers in CLN3 pathology, suggesting a potentially complex etiology<sup><xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR12"">12</xref>–<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR14"">14</xref></sup>. Specifically, the accumulation of autofluorescent lipopigment (lipofuscin) in retinal neurons and degeneration of multiple retinal cell layers has been documented in CLN3 disease<sup><xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR13"">13</xref>,<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR14"">14</xref></sup>. High levels of lipofuscin are a characteristic of the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) in many macular dystrophies<sup><xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR15"">15</xref>–<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR17"">17</xref></sup>. Increased lipofuscin has also been shown experimentally to accumulate in mouse models of defective photoreceptor outer segment (POS) phagosome degradation<sup><xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR18"">18</xref>,<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR19"">19</xref></sup>. However, the RPE in CLN3 disease has notably low levels of lipofuscin<sup><xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR13"">13</xref>,<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR14"">14</xref></sup>, even though it still undergoes atrophy<sup><xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR13"">13</xref></sup>. One explanation for this apparent paradox is that loss of vision in CLN3 disease patients starts at a young age (5–10 years old<sup><xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR5"">5</xref></sup>), with reduced rod and cone responses<sup><xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR2"">2</xref>,<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR20"">20</xref>,<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR21"">21</xref></sup> and photoreceptor cell loss<sup><xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR2"">2</xref>,<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR21"">21</xref>,<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR22"">22</xref></sup>, and that the low levels of lipofuscin in the RPE result from the presence of fewer photoreceptors. Each mammalian RPE cell ingests and degrades 10% of the distal POS disks on a daily basis<sup><xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR23"">23</xref></sup>, and lipofuscin accumulates normally with age as a result of POS degradation products<sup><xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR24"">24</xref></sup>. Fewer photoreceptors mean fewer POS phagosomes, resulting in reduced lipofuscin accumulation<sup><xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR14"">14</xref>,<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR25"">25</xref>,<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR26"">26</xref></sup>. Because of the early onset of disease, it is not clear whether the photoreceptor cell loss precedes any changes in the RPE, as would be predicted by this explanation. An alternative explanation for reduced RPE lipofuscin is that there is another defect associated with the RPE, besides lysosomal dysfunction. For example, it is plausible that RPE cells fail to take up POS in CLN3 disease. This hypothesis could also explain the increased autofluorescence accumulation observed in the photoreceptor layer (presence of POS debris) and photoreceptor loss in CLN3 disease<sup><xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR1"">1</xref>,<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR21"">21</xref>,<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR27"">27</xref>,<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR28"">28</xref></sup>. Indeed, decreased uptake of POS by RPE cells in a form of retinitis pigmentosa caused by mutations in the <italic toggle=""yes"">MERTK</italic> gene<sup><xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR29"">29</xref>,<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR30"">30</xref></sup> leads to a similar pathology as CLN3 disease. However, apart from one published study in a mouse model<sup><xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR31"">31</xref></sup>, the role of RPE cell dysfunction in CLN3 disease retinal pathology has not been investigated. The human induced pluripotent stem cell (hiPSC) technology allows the investigation of pathological and molecular changes in an individual cell type, using cells derived from patients. With regard to human retinal diseases, the use of hiPSCs is specifically pertinent to RPE-based disorders<sup><xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR32"">32</xref>–<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR35"">35</xref></sup>. Despite the fact that hiPSC-RPE monocultures lack the complexity of functional and structural interactions with photoreceptors, they have been successfully used to investigate the pathological mechanisms of both early onset retinal diseases, such as Best disease<sup><xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR36"">36</xref></sup> and late onset disease, such as age-related macular degeneration<sup><xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR37"">37</xref>,<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR38"">38</xref></sup>. In fact, several studies have now shown that feeding a physiological amount of POS to hiPSC-RPE cells can be utilized to investigate POS phagocytosis regulation in normal versus diseased cells<sup><xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR36"">36</xref>,<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR39"">39</xref>,<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR40"">40</xref></sup>. In this study, using primary mouse and human RPE, CLN3 overexpression, and hiPSC-based disease modeling experiments, we show that a proportion of CLN3 in RPE cells is localized to the RPE apical microvilli. Notably, cell-autonomous CLN3 dysfunction in RPE cells is sufficient to affect RPE microvillar density and POS binding and consequently POS uptake by the CLN3 disease hiPSC-RPE cells, leading to decreased accumulation of autofluorescent POS-digestion products in the CLN3 disease hiPSC-RPE cells. This result, together with longitudinal multimodal imaging of the retina in a CLN3 disease patient, suggests that autofluorescent changes in the photoreceptor–RPE complex that are concordant with POS phagocytosis defect may precede photoreceptor cell loss in CLN3 disease. Importantly, lentivirus-mediated overexpression of wild-type CLN3 can rescue POS phagocytosis defect in the CLN3 disease hiPSC-RPE cells. Altogether, our data define a previously unidentified role of CLN3 at the photoreceptor–RPE interface and suggest a contribution of primary RPE dysfunction in instigating reduced RPE lipofuscin that can be therapeutically targeted by gene augmentation.  In this study, we propose that CLN3 is localized to apical microvilli of RPE and is essential for crucial structure (RPE microvilli) and function (POS phagocytosis) of RPE cells that are vital for photoreceptor survival and therefore vision. Using hiPSC-RPE from patients harboring a homozygous 966 bp deletion spanning exon 7 and 8, the most common mutation in CLN3 disease, we show that disease-causing <italic toggle=""yes"">CLN3</italic> mutations in CLN3 disease affect both RPE cell structure and function in a cell autonomous manner. Specifically, a proportion of CLN3 in human, mouse and hiPSC-RPE cells localized to the RPE microvilli, the RPE structure necessary for POS phagocytosis. Furthermore, disease-causing mutations in <italic toggle=""yes"">CLN3</italic> led to loss of CLN3 function which subsequently decreased apical RPE microvilli density and reduced POS binding that resulted in lower uptake of POS by CLN3 disease hiPSC-RPE cells. Of note, consistent with the requirement of CLN3 for POS phagocytosis, lower uptake of POS could be rescued by lentivirus-mediated WT-CLN3 overexpression in CLN3 disease hiPSC-RPE cells. Also, consistent with reduced POS uptake, CLN3 disease hiPSC-RPE displayed decreased autofluorescent POS-breakdown products. Notably, these results are in alignment with reduced lipofuscin (autofluorescent POS-breakdown product) observed in CLN3 disease donor eyes<sup><xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR13"">13</xref></sup> (Fig. <xref rid=""Fig2"" ref-type=""fig"">2A, B</xref> and Supplementary Fig. <xref rid=""MOESM2"" ref-type=""media"">2</xref>), ERG recordings<sup><xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR20"">20</xref>,<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR21"">21</xref></sup> and the retinal imaging pattern<sup><xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR64"">64</xref></sup>, (Fig. <xref rid=""Fig9"" ref-type=""fig"">9</xref>) in early stage CLN3 disease in vivo. Altogether, these results illustrate a role of CLN3 in regulating POS phagocytosis in human RPE cells and (<italic toggle=""yes"">i</italic>) suggest a role of primary RPE dysfunction in CLN3-associated retinal degeneration and (<italic toggle=""yes"">ii</italic>) indicate gene-therapy targeting RPE cells as a potential treatment option to suppress photoreceptor cell loss in CLN3 disease caused due to the common 966 bp deletion. The photoreceptor–RPE interface plays a crucial role in retinal homeostasis and is the primary site of disease pathology in several retinal degenerative diseases (e.g. Best disease<sup><xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR36"">36</xref></sup>, retinitis pigmentosa<sup><xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR29"">29</xref></sup>). In fact, both structural pathology affecting the RPE microvilli and functional alterations impacting POS phagocytosis can notably affect the ability of RPE cells to support photoreceptor cell health. For instance, loss of RPE apical microvilli arising from mutations in <italic toggle=""yes"">EZR</italic> and <italic toggle=""yes"">SOD2</italic> has been linked to the development of retinal degeneration<sup><xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR65"">65</xref>–<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR67"">67</xref></sup>. Similarly, defective POS phagocytosis caused by mutations in <italic toggle=""yes"">MERTK</italic> leads to photoreceptor cell loss and retinal degeneration<sup><xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR29"">29</xref>,<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR68"">68</xref></sup>. It is noteworthy that despite reduced POS phagocytosis by CLN3 disease hiPSC-RPE cells, the protein expression of the POS binding receptor, avß5 integrin (Supplementary Fig. <xref rid=""MOESM2"" ref-type=""media"">6</xref>), the POS engulfment receptor, MERTK (Supplementary Fig. <xref rid=""MOESM2"" ref-type=""media"">6</xref>), and RPE apical microvilli regulator, EZR (Fig. <xref rid=""Fig1"" ref-type=""fig"">1E</xref>), were unchanged between control and CLN3 disease hiPSC-RPE cells. CLN3 has been shown to regulate cytoskeletal architecture in other cell types<sup><xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR69"">69</xref>,<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR70"">70</xref></sup>. In conjunction with CLN3 (Fig. <xref rid=""Fig7"" ref-type=""fig"">7</xref>), other proteins involved in cytoskeletal organization, including F-ACTN, are major constituents of apical RPE microvilli<sup><xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR50"">50</xref>,<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR71"">71</xref></sup>. However, immunocytochemical localization revealed a similar expression pattern of F-ACTN in control versus CLN3 disease hiPSC-RPE cells (Fig. <xref rid=""Fig6"" ref-type=""fig"">6A, B</xref>). It is still plausible that reduced apical microvilli density (Fig. <xref rid=""Fig6"" ref-type=""fig"">6C, D</xref>) directly contributes to decreased POS binding and uptake by CLN3 disease hiPSC-RPE cells. Of note, although there is currently limited information on RPE microvilli formation/turnover, the RPE microvilli comprises of densely packed actin filaments and other cytoskeleton components, including EZR and Ezrin-Radixin-Moesin-Binding Phosphoprotein 50 (EBP50)<sup><xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR72"">72</xref>,<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR73"">73</xref></sup>. Notably, lack of F-ACTN and/or EZR can impact microvilli formation<sup><xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR67"">67</xref>,<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR74"">74</xref></sup> and thereby impact RPE cell’s phagocytic ability by impacting POS binding<sup><xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR46"">46</xref></sup>. Furthermore, cytoskeletal rearrangement is crucial for POS ingestion by RPE cells<sup><xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR75"">75</xref></sup>. Given that CLN3 has been shown to (<italic toggle=""yes"">i</italic>) interact with non-muscle myosin IIB (NM-IIB), an F-ACTN binding motor protein that has been suggested to play a role in POS phagocytosis<sup><xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR69"">69</xref></sup> and (<italic toggle=""yes"">ii</italic>) impact cytoskeletal re-organization in other cell type(s)<sup><xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR76"">76</xref></sup>, it is plausible that CLN3 could impact microvilli formation and turnover as well as POS phagocytosis in RPE cells through its interactions with cytoskeletal proteins, such as NM-IIB and F-ACTN. Furthermore, primary dysfunction within RPE microvilli and lack of microvilli has been shown to impact photoreceptor–RPE interaction and lead to vision loss in mice lacking EZR protein<sup><xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR67"">67</xref></sup> and in a canine model of inherited retinal degeneration, Best disease<sup><xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR77"">77</xref></sup>. Another possibility is that the impaired RPE phagocytosis of POS by CLN3 disease is a consequence of impaired endocytosis. For instance, several studies have suggested a crucial role of CLN3 in the endosomal-lysosomal pathway<sup><xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR78"">78</xref>–<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR80"">80</xref></sup> and the endolysosomal system is involved in regulation and recycling of plasma membrane components required for POS phagocytosis (e.g. αVβ5 integrin<sup><xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR81"">81</xref></sup>) and microvilli formation<sup><xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR82"">82</xref></sup>. It is also possible that some of the molecular defects in CLN3 disease hiPSC-RPE cells were masked in our study as we compared CLN3 disease hiPSC-RPE cells to control hiPSC-RPE cells constituting of heterozygote carriers (family members) and unrelated healthy subjects. However, we did confirm no difference in POS phagocytic capability and microvilli density between CLN3 heterozygote carriers and healthy subjects with no CLN3 defect. Furthermore, though gene-corrected lines were not included in this study, as the CLN3 mutation investigated here leads to homozygous 966 bp deletion spanning exon 7 and 8<sup><xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR83"">83</xref></sup>, making it challenging for genome editing/CRISPR correction, we utilized WT-CLN3 overexpression in CLN3 disease hiPSC-RPE cells to investigate the role of CLN3 in POS phagocytosis. The correction of <italic toggle=""yes"">CLN3</italic> mutation in CLN3 disease hiPSCs and introduction of <italic toggle=""yes"">CLN3</italic> mutation in control hiPSC-RPE cells will be valuable tools to further investigate CLN3 function and CLN3 disease pathophysiology. Similarly, a comparison of molecular and structural defects between CLN3 disease hiPSC-RPE cells and hiPSC-RPE derived from patients with CLN3-associated non-syndromic retinal degeneration would be instrumental in further elucidating the role of RPE dysfunction in instigating photoreceptor degeneration in CLN3 disease versus non-syndromic CLN3-associated retinal degeneration. Notably and consistent with an important role of CLN3 in outer retina homeostasis, in the non-syndromic form of retinal degeneration caused by other mutations in <italic toggle=""yes"">CLN3</italic>, the initial defects in the retina are restricted to the photoreceptor–RPE complex<sup><xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR21"">21</xref>,<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR84"">84</xref></sup>. A recent study using CLN3 disease rodent model has implicated impaired lysosomal degradation of POS by RPE cells in CLN3 disease pathology<sup><xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR31"">31</xref></sup>. This hypothesis is particularly attractive because CLN3 has been postulated to play a critical role in lysosomal homeostasis in multiple cell types<sup><xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR2"">2</xref>,<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR54"">54</xref>,<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR85"">85</xref>,<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR86"">86</xref></sup>. Furthermore, impaired lysosomal degradation of POS membranes by RPE cells has been experimentally linked to loss of photoreceptors in mouse models<sup><xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR18"">18</xref>,<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR87"">87</xref></sup>. Consistent with a role of CLN3 in lysosomal function, a proportion of CLN3 in hiPSC-RPE cells co-localized with lysosomal marker, LAMP1 (Supplementary Fig. <xref rid=""MOESM2"" ref-type=""media"">9</xref>). However, we did not pursue the role of CLN3 in POS degradation in the current study as impaired lysosomal degradation of POS by CLN3 disease hiPSC-RPE cells, while plausible, is in direct contrast to the decreased accumulation of POS digestion products observed in CLN3 disease hiPSC-RPE cells<sup><xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR2"">2</xref></sup> (Fig. <xref rid=""Fig2"" ref-type=""fig"">2</xref>). In contrast, POS binding and uptake defect by CLN3 disease hiPSC-RPE cells is consistent with both reduced accumulation of lipofuscin in the RPE and increased autofluorescence in photoreceptor cell layer<sup><xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR1"">1</xref>,<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR13"">13</xref>,<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR14"">14</xref></sup> that could plausibly be POS debris. In fact, as shown here (Fig. <xref rid=""Fig9"" ref-type=""fig"">9</xref>), a paracentral hyperautofluorescent annulus is seen in CLN3 disease<sup><xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR21"">21</xref></sup> and in other retinal degenerations<sup><xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR88"">88</xref></sup>, which may be representative of increased accumulation of POS debris at the transition zone between healthy and unhealthy photoreceptors. Ultimately, if RPE dysfunction and POS phagocytosis defect are central to photoreceptor cell loss and retinal degeneration in CLN3 disease and CLN3-associated non-syndromic retinal degeneration, RPE cells may be a crucial gene therapy target for these blinding disorders.

"Slowing Late Infantile Batten Disease by Direct Brain Parenchymal Administration of a rh.10 Adeno-Associated Virus Expressing <italic toggle=""yes"">CLN2</italic>","Late infantile Batten disease (CLN2 disease) is a rare, autosomal recessive, neurodegenerative lysosomal storage disease caused by mutations in the <italic toggle=""yes"">CLN2</italic> gene encoding tripeptidyl peptidase 1 (TPP1). We tested intraparenchymal delivery of AAVrh.10hCLN2, a nonhuman serotype rh.10 adeno-associated virus vector encoding human <italic toggle=""yes"">CLN2</italic>, in a non-randomized trial consisting of 2 arms assessed over 18 months: an AAVrh.10hCLN2-treated cohort of 8 children with mild to moderate disease, and an untreated, Weill Cornell natural history cohort consisting of 12 children. The treated cohort was also compared to an untreated European natural history cohort of CLN2 disease. The vector was administered through 6 burr holes directly to 12 sites in the brain without immunosuppression. In an additional safety assessment under a separate protocol, 5 children with severe CLN2 disease were treated with AAVrh.10hCLN2. The therapy was associated with a variety of expected adverse events, none causing long-term disability. Induction of systemic anti-AAVrh.10 immunity was mild. Post-therapy, the treated cohort had a 1.3- to 2.6-fold increase in cerebral spinal fluid TPP1. There was a slower loss of grey matter volume in 4 of 7 children by MRI; and a 42.4% and a 47.5% reduction in the rate of decline of motor and language function, compared to the Weill Cornell natural history cohort (p<0.04), and European natural history cohort (p<0.0001), respectively. Intraparenchymal brain administration of AAVrh.10hCLN2 slowed the progression of disease in children with CLN2 disease. However, improvements in vector design and delivery strategies will be necessary to halt disease progression using gene therapy. Administration of an adeno-associated virus coding for the CLN2 gene into the brain parenchyma slows the progression of CLN2 disease in children. Gene therapy for CLN2 disease The current treatment for CLN2 disease, caused by mutations in the <italic toggle=""yes"">CLN2</italic> gene, is infusion of human recombinant tripeptidyl peptidase 1 (TPP1) into the cerebrospinal fluid every other week, which slows but does not halt progression of the disease. Sondhi and colleagues sought an alternative treatment through gene therapy. They injected an adeno-associated virus vector expressing the normal human <italic toggle=""yes"">CLN2</italic> coding sequence directly into the brain parenchyma of children with the disease. Progression of the disease was slowed in treated children, but not to the same degree as recombinant TPP1. Further improvements in gene therapy are needed before progression of CLN2 disease can be halted.",Full text not available in PMC,N/A,11 4 2021
