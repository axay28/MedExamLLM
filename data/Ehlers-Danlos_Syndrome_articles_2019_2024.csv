Hypoglycemia Associated With Hypermobile Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome,"Hypoglycemia in the absence of diabetes is often multifactorial and challenging to diagnose definitively. We present a case report and an expanded series of adult females with reactive hypoglycemia who were diagnosed with Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (EDS). These patients exhibited predominantly postprandial hypoglycemia, with some fasting and activity-induced episodes. Clinical findings included autonomic dysfunction, gastrointestinal symptoms, and joint hypermobility. Interventions focused on medical nutrition therapy, continuous glucose monitoring, and, in some cases, medication. Many patients continued to experience hypoglycemic episodes despite treatment. Key learning points include the potential association between hypermobile EDS and hypoglycemia, the importance of confirming the Whipple triad, and the need for multidisciplinary management. This case series highlights the need for further research into the prevalence and pathophysiology of hypoglycemia in EDS.","Hypoglycemia without diabetes is often defined by timing or provocative factors, such as fasting, postprandial, exercise-induced, or mixed patterns. Symptoms, reflecting parasympathetic and sympathetic activation, may include sweating, tremor, dizziness, palpitations, fatigue, hunger, and anxiety. Severe hypoglycemia may lead to neuroglycopenia, with difficulty concentrating, confusion, loss of consciousness, seizure, and coma. Given the nonspecific nature of symptoms, confirming hypoglycemia requires fulfilling the Whipple triad: documented hypoglycemia during symptoms and resolution after normalization of glucose [<xref rid=""luae205-B1"" ref-type=""bibr"">1</xref>]. Diagnostic evaluation in adults focuses on excluding autonomous insulin secretion due to insulinoma, insulin-like factors produced by nonislet cell tumors, adrenal insufficiency, malnutrition, other illnesses, congenital disorders, long QT syndrome [<xref rid=""luae205-B2"" ref-type=""bibr"">2</xref>], alcohol use, and medication side effects. Achieving a definitive diagnosis can be challenging, especially for postprandial hypoglycemia. Reactive hypoglycemia can occur after upper gastrointestinal surgery (eg, bariatric surgery, esophagectomy, gastrectomy, fundoplication) but has also been described in dysautonomia [<xref rid=""luae205-B3"" ref-type=""bibr"">3</xref>], nonsurgical rapid gastric emptying, and other forms of intestinal dysmotility [<xref rid=""luae205-B4"" ref-type=""bibr"">4</xref>] However, the etiology of reactive hypoglycemia remains undefined for many patients. Diagnostic evaluation is often complicated by significant symptom overlap between reactive hypoglycemia and other conditions that cause postprandial symptoms without hypoglycemia, including dumping syndrome, orthostatic hypotension, cardiac arrhythmias, and dysautonomia. We report a series of patients with documented reactive hypoglycemia associated with Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (EDS), a group of connective tissue disorders characterized by joint instability, skin hyperextensibility, and tissue fragility [<xref rid=""luae205-B5"" ref-type=""bibr"">5</xref>]. Associated conditions may include dysautonomia, postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome [<xref rid=""luae205-B6"" ref-type=""bibr"">6</xref>], intestinal dysmotility, hernias, headaches, fatigue, chronic pain, seizure, and mast cell activation syndrome [<xref rid=""luae205-B7"" ref-type=""bibr"">7</xref>]. EDS is likely underdiagnosed, with some patients seeking care for years before diagnosis. A 33-year-old female with an established clinical diagnosis of hypermobile EDS (hEDS) was referred for evaluation of possible hypoglycemia during hospitalization for seizure-like activity. Seizure-like activity had occurred 2 hours after breakfast, during an outpatient visit when she reported fatigue, malaise, and diaphoresis; capillary glucose was 65 mg/dL (3.6 mmol/L, reference range: 70-100 mg/dL; 3.9-5.6 mmol/L). The patient was hospitalized; after an overnight fast, she reported palpitations, lethargy, sweating, and dizziness. Capillary glucose was 61 mg/dL (3.4 mmol/L); symptoms were relieved promptly with juice. She reported the onset of similar symptoms during high school, including weakness, sweating, shakiness, and piloerection, particularly after activity on warm days. An oral glucose tolerance test performed at an external institution revealed venous glucose of 45 mg/dL (2.5 mmol/L) at 2 hours, prompting the diagnosis of reactive hypoglycemia. At age 28, she sustained 2 concussions after head trauma, followed by multiple seizure-like events. Video electroencephalography during symptomatic events was negative for epileptic seizures, with diagnosis of nonepileptic seizures. Worsening nonepileptic seizure frequency prompted emergency room evaluation; capillary glucose was 51 mg/dL (2.8 mmol/L). IV dextrose improved glucose to 70 mg/dL (3.9 mmol/L), but a subsequent fall to 50 mg/dL (2.8 mmol/L) was associated with recurrent seizure-like activity. Inadequate nutrition was deemed the likely cause, despite stable body mass index 23 kg/m<sup>2</sup>. The patient reported recurrent symptoms of weakness, fatigue, dizziness, sweating, thirst, shakiness, palpitations, impaired memory, difficulty concentrating, slow thinking, and confusion; home glucose monitoring revealed capillary glucose <60 mg/dL (3.3 mmol/L). Episodes typically occurred 2 hours after breakfast, with activity >10 minutes, hot weather, showering, and occasionally in fasting and midnocturnal states. She experienced 10+ events requiring emergency room evaluation due to loss of consciousness. hEDS had been diagnosed with a Beighton score of 9/9, characterized by joint hypermobility, recurrent joint dislocations; hyperextensible skin; atrophic scarring; dental crowding with a high, narrow palate; striae unrelated to weight gain/loss; recurrent abdominal hernia; piezogenic heel papules; and chronic widespread pain. Mitral regurgitation was noted on echocardiogram. Additional diagnoses included postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome (POTS), small fiber neuropathy, dysautonomia, Raynaud syndrome, orthostatic hypotension, pleural effusions, biliary dyskinesia, gastroesophageal reflux, constipation, goiter, hearing loss, polycystic ovarian syndrome, intestinal bacterial overgrowth, migraine, iron deficiency anemia, and vitamin B12 deficiency. There was no history of hypoglycemia during infancy or childhood, upper gastrointestinal surgery, disordered eating, or adrenal insufficiency. Weight was stable for several years with a body mass index 22 to 23 kg/m<sup>2</sup>. Surgical history included repair of meniscus and wrist ligaments. Medications included levalbuterol, multivitamins, B-complex, vitamin D3, and magnesium, with stable usage over time. The patient’s family history included maternal hEDS and paternal type 2 diabetes, overweight, hypertension, and hyperlipidemia. There was no family history of hypoglycemia; multiple endocrine neoplasia; or disorders of adrenal, pituitary, parathyroid, or pancreas. Laboratory testing after overnight fasting on 3 separate occasions showed normal venous glucose (81-89 mg/dL [4.5-4.9 mmol/L]; reference range: 70-100 mg/dL [3.9-5.6 mmol/L]) and appropriate β-cell peptides (insulin 2.7-3.9 μIU/mL [18.7-27 pmol/L]; reference: <18.4 μIU/mL [128 pmol/L]), proinsulin <7.5 pmol/L (reference: < 8.8 pmol/L), C-peptide 0.60-0.85 ng/mL [0.20-0.28 nmol/L] (reference: 0.8-3.85 ng/mL [2-9.6 nmol/L]). Morning cortisol (13-14 μg/dL [359-386 nmol/L]; reference: 5-25 μg/dL [138-690 nmol/L]) and postcosyntropin cortisol, TSH, gastrin, IGF1, IGF2, and prolactin were normal. Abdominal computed tomography and brain magnetic resonance imaging were unremarkable. During an inpatient fast, she developed chest pressure, palpitations, paresthesias, and confusion at 36 hours, with concurrent plasma glucose of 51 mg/dL (2.8 mmol/L). Glucose increased by 15 mg/dL (0.83 mmol/L) 30 minutes after glucagon administration, consistent with a lack of excessive insulin action during prolonged fast. At fast termination, there was appropriate suppression of insulin (2.3 μIU/mL [16 pmol/L]; reference range for prolonged fast: <3 μIU/mL [20.8 pmol/L]), proinsulin (4.5 pmol/L; reference: <5 pmol/L), and C-peptide (0.55 ng/mL [0.18 nmol/L]; reference: <0.2 nmol/L [0.6 ng/mL]), with normal glucagon (57 pg/mL [57 ng/L]; reference: 50-100 pg/mL [50-100 ng/L]) and robust induction of ketogenesis (β-hydroxybutyrate 5.7 mmol/L; reference for prolonged fast: >2.7 mmol/L). The overall assessment was predominantly reactive hypoglycemia, potentially related to disordered autonomic control of glucose metabolism in the context of prior traumatic brain injuries, intestinal dysmotility, and EDS. Although the majority of available glucose levels were capillary samples, low capillary glucose corresponded closely with venous samples during fasting. Initial treatment included a Dexcom G6 continuous glucose monitor (CGM), uncooked cornstarch, and glucagon for emergency use. Medical nutrition therapy focused on frequent small meals with low glycemic index foods. Despite meticulous adherence, CGM revealed sensor glucose <70 mg/dL (3.9 mmol/L) for 3% to 12% of all readings, most commonly postbreakfast, postactivity, and during midnocturnal hours (range: 42-147 mg/dL [2.3-8.2 mmol/L]). The patient was followed in a hypoglycemia-focused clinic, and her clinical status remained stable. Additional patients with EDS and similar patterns of confirmed hypoglycemia were recognized in our hypoglycemia-focused clinic (<xref rid=""luae205-T1"" ref-type=""table"">Tables 1</xref> and <xref rid=""luae205-T2"" ref-type=""table"">2</xref>). Most patients had a confirmed hEDS diagnosis; 69% had an EDS family history. Autonomic dysfunction (dysmotility, dysautonomia, neuropathy, POTS, orthostatic hypotension, and mast cell activation syndrome) was common. All patients experienced reactive hypoglycemia; 61% also reported fasting hypoglycemia. Minimum plasma and capillary glucose were 47 (2.6 mmol/L) and 39 mg/dL (2.1 mmol/L), respectively. These observations suggested a strong association between EDS and hypoglycemia. We report documented hypoglycemia occurring in patients with EDS. Hypoglycemia symptoms were most common postprandially but also after activity, short-term fasting, and delayed meals. Symptoms were confirmed by venous, sensor, and/or capillary glucose. Some individuals experienced neuroglycopenia, loss of consciousness, and seizures. EDS is a hereditary connective tissue disorder with 13 defined subtypes, all characterized by abnormalities in connective tissue [<xref rid=""luae205-B8"" ref-type=""bibr"">8</xref>, <xref rid=""luae205-B9"" ref-type=""bibr"">9</xref>]. hEDS is the most common form, with a primarily autosomal dominant inheritance pattern, but specific genes remain unidentified. Diagnosis relies on clinical criteria including the hEDS checklist and Beighton scoring, with an exam demonstrating hypermobility, skin extensibility, and atrophic scarring. Additional features include dysautonomia [<xref rid=""luae205-B10"" ref-type=""bibr"">10</xref>, <xref rid=""luae205-B11"" ref-type=""bibr"">11</xref>], POTS, dysmotility/gastrointestinal complaints [<xref rid=""luae205-B12"" ref-type=""bibr"">12</xref>], recurrent hernias, dislocations/subluxations, headaches, fatigue, and pain. Gastrointestinal manifestations include both structural (hernias, rectoceles, prolapse) and functional (dysmotility) abnormalities [<xref rid=""luae205-B13"" ref-type=""bibr"">13</xref>]. Dysautonomia may encompass altered sympathetic reactivity, potentially related to neuropathy, connective tissue laxity, and vasoactive medications [<xref rid=""luae205-B11"" ref-type=""bibr"">11</xref>]. Symptoms of palpitations, diaphoresis, dizziness, fatigue, nausea, anxiety, brain fog, cognitive changes, blurred vision, and loss of consciousness may overlap between EDS-related disorders and hypoglycemia. Therefore, careful documentation of glucose at the time of symptoms is required in order to fulfill the Whipple triad; venous glucose is preferred for diagnosis, as alterations in blood flow may reduce the accuracy of capillary and sensor glucose measurements, potentially yielding falsely low values. Professional (masked) continuous glucose monitoring with a symptom, activity, and meal diary can be helpful to assess patterns but not for diagnosis. The diagnostic approach for possible hypoglycemia (<xref rid=""luae205-F1"" ref-type=""fig"">Fig. 1</xref>) begins with a comprehensive history, examination, and verification of the Whipple triad (low venous glucose at the time of symptoms or multiple capillary glucose measurements if venous sampling is not feasible). If the Whipple triad criteria are met, hypoglycemia is confirmed. Subsequent evaluation is aimed at defining the etiology of hypoglycemia using a critical sample by measuring β-cell peptides (insulin, proinsulin, C-peptide), β-hydroxybutyrate, cortisol, and possibly other hormones. If samples at the time of documented hypoglycemia are not available, prolonged fasting may be needed to assess the contribution of β-cell peptides and to fully exclude those disorders requiring distinct therapy, such as insulinoma or other tumors, noninsulinoma pancreatogenous hypoglycemia syndrome, autoimmune hypoglycemia, malnutrition, side effects of medications or supplements, and hormone deficiencies (eg, adrenal insufficiency). In hypoglycemia with predominant reactive (postprandial or postexercise) patterns, potential causes include upper gastrointestinal surgery, autoimmune hypoglycemia, insulinoma, noninsulinoma pancreatogenous hypoglycemia syndrome, or drug-related factors. If the patient does not respond to initial management (eg, medical nutrition therapy, acarbose, CGM), further laboratory testing, imaging for localization, and/or prolonged fasting should be considered. The index patient described in this report had previously had an oral glucose tolerance test; however, this is not recommended as part of the evaluation, as it is nonphysiologic and induces hypoglycemia in 10% of healthy people [<xref rid=""luae205-B14"" ref-type=""bibr"">14</xref>]. A relationship between EDS and hypoglycemia has not been previously described to our knowledge. Possible etiologic factors linking EDS to hypoglycemia may include intestinal dysmotility, dysautonomia, and Chiari malformation. In our experience, β-cell peptides are appropriately suppressed at the time of hypoglycemia in EDS-associated hypoglycemia. Gastrointestinal manifestations, including dysmotility, are common in hEDS. Notably, rapid gastric emptying may contribute to postprandial hypoglycemia in affected individuals [<xref rid=""luae205-B15"" ref-type=""bibr"">15</xref>, <xref rid=""luae205-B16"" ref-type=""bibr"">16</xref>]. Gastric emptying studies may be considered based on symptom patterns. Disordered eating, reduced caloric intake, or malabsorption could reduce gluconeogenesis and/or glycogen stores [<xref rid=""luae205-B17"" ref-type=""bibr"">17</xref>, <xref rid=""luae205-B18"" ref-type=""bibr"">18</xref>]. Celiac disease, gluten intolerance, Crohn's disease, reflux esophagitis, and mast cell activation disorders may be more prevalent in EDS, potentially contributing to dysregulation of gut and immune function [<xref rid=""luae205-B17"" ref-type=""bibr"">17</xref>, <xref rid=""luae205-B19"" ref-type=""bibr"">19</xref>, <xref rid=""luae205-B20"" ref-type=""bibr"">20</xref>]. EDS-associated autonomic dysfunction could influence hypoglycemia via several mechanisms. First, recurrent hypoglycemia may impair counterregulation in response to declining glucose, reducing awareness of hypoglycemia (hypoglycemia-associated autonomic failure) and increasing vulnerability to hypoglycemia [<xref rid=""luae205-B21"" ref-type=""bibr"">21</xref>]. Second, autonomic dysfunction could alter neuronal responses to hypoglycemia. Glut2-dependent glucose-sensing neurons regulate insulin secretion through vagal firing [<xref rid=""luae205-B22"" ref-type=""bibr"">22</xref>], while hypothalamic nutrient sensing modulates hepatic glucose production via autonomic projections to the liver [<xref rid=""luae205-B23"" ref-type=""bibr"">23</xref>]. Small fiber neuropathy is common in EDS [<xref rid=""luae205-B24"" ref-type=""bibr"">24</xref>]. Individuals with hEDS and gastrointestinal symptoms also score higher on orthostatic domains in autonomic symptom scales [<xref rid=""luae205-B25"" ref-type=""bibr"">25</xref>, <xref rid=""luae205-B26"" ref-type=""bibr"">26</xref>]. Altered blood flow could also result in falsely low capillary and sensor glucose readings, underscoring the importance of venous glucose levels for diagnosis. Chiari malformation (type I) is associated with EDS [<xref rid=""luae205-B27"" ref-type=""bibr"">27</xref>]. It may cause altered intracranial pressure, resulting in vagal hypertonia. In turn, vagal stimulation of pancreatic islets can increase insulin stimulation. Chiari malformation effects on the brainstem may also cause dysregulation of counterregulatory mechanisms [<xref rid=""luae205-B28"" ref-type=""bibr"">28</xref>]. If EDS is suggested on the basis of history and examination, the short (<10-minute) hEDS Diagnostic Checklist may be a useful screening tool. If the patient meets clinical criteria, referral to a geneticist or other clinician experienced in differentiating EDS from other connective tissue disorders is recommended. As with all patients with established hypoglycemia, management requires a multidisciplinary team. Although no established guidelines exist, management is informed by experience in treating hypoglycemia associated with other conditions. Individualized medical nutritional therapy should focus on adequate macronutrient intake and minimizing gastrointestinal symptoms while considering preferences and intolerances. Limiting carbohydrates to only low glycemic index (complex) carbohydrates (20-30 g for meals, 10-15 g for snacks) and ensuring adequate protein intake can be helpful. Alcohol should be avoided as it can worsen hypoglycemia. Uncooked cornstarch or related products may be used before activity, bedtime, or other vulnerable periods [<xref rid=""luae205-B29"" ref-type=""bibr"">29</xref>]. If dietary measures are insufficient and safety is compromised, medications may be indicated, such as acarbose, especially in individuals with rapid gastric emptying. While additional medications can be considered based on glycemic patterns and severity, complete elimination of hypoglycemia is unlikely with current options. Personal CGMs with alarms, despite lower accuracy at low glucose ranges, may help individuals with severe hypoglycemia and unawareness to identify impending episodes and initiate treatment to prevent severe hypoglycemia. If a CGM is not available, glucose monitoring 1 to 3 hours after meals, with activity or exercise, and when symptomatic can be helpful. Even with a CGM, patients should be educated to recognize healthy glucose patterns and encouraged to verify low sensor glucose readings with capillary measurements. Patients should ensure their fingers are warm and well-perfused to avoid falsely low readings, especially in those with Raynaud phenomenon. In summary, we observe that hypoglycemia can occur in individuals with EDS and may present with largely postmeal and activity-induced patterns. Thus, if a rigorous diagnostic workup of a patient with established hypoglycemia does not yield a specific diagnosis, clinicians should consider evaluation for EDS using clinical criteria. We recognize that both EDS and hypoglycemia are uncommon, and ascertainment bias could confound the association. Future research will be required to assess the prevalence of hypoglycemia in EDS cohorts, dissect relationships between glucose and possible hypoglycemic symptoms, and define the pathophysiology underlying this potential association.

Surgical management of glenohumeral instability in patients with Ehlers-Danlos syndrome/hypermobility spectrum disorder and their risk of reoperation,," The initial query identified a total of 756 patients diagnosed with EDS/HSD and 139,764 without a diagnosis. <xref rid=""tbl1"" ref-type=""table"">Table I</xref> depicts the proportion of surgeries broken down by CPT code between the two cohorts. Among EDS/HSD patients, there were 192 (25.40%) open procedures, including 55 (28.65%) with bone block, and 616 (81.48%) arthroscopic procedures. Among control patients, there were 15,982 (11.43%) open procedures, including 5280 (33.04%) with bone block, and 125,994 (90.15%) arthroscopic procedures. Patients previously diagnosed with EDS/HSD were more likely to undergo open posterior (aOR = 3.47, 95% CI [2.13, 5.31]), open capsulorrhaphy (aOR = 5.04, 95% CI [3.97, 6.32]), and Latarjet (aOR = 1.84, 95% CI [1.33, 2.48]) procedures than patients without EDS/HSD. In contrast, hypermobile patients were significantly less likely to undergo arthroscopic Bankart repair than healthy patients (aOR = 0.41, 95% CI [0.34, 0.50]).<table-wrap position=""float"" id=""tbl1""><label>Table I</label><caption><p>Surgical instability management distribution by type of procedure in patients with and without a preoperative diagnosis of Ehlers-Danlos syndrome/hypermobility spectrum disorder.</p></caption><table frame=""hsides"" rules=""groups""><thead><tr><th>Procedure code</th><th>EDS (n = 756), n (%)</th><th>Non-EDS (n = 139,764), n (%)</th><th>OR (95% CI)</th><th><italic toggle=""yes"">P</italic> value</th><th>aOR (95% CI)</th><th><italic toggle=""yes"">P</italic> value</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Open</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td align=""char""> 23455</td><td align=""char"">31 (4.1)</td><td align=""char"">6658 (4.8)</td><td align=""char"">0.85 (0.60-1.23)</td><td align=""char"">.442</td><td align=""char"">0.95 (0.65-1.34)</td><td align=""char"">.795</td></tr><tr><td align=""char""> 23465</td><td align=""char"">20 (2.6)</td><td align=""char"">1410 (1.0)</td><td align=""char"">2.67 (1.70-4.17)</td><td align=""char""><bold><.001</bold></td><td align=""char"">3.47 (2.13-5.31)</td><td align=""char""><bold><.001</bold></td></tr><tr><td align=""char""> 23466</td><td align=""char"">86 (11.4)</td><td align=""char"">2634 (1.9)</td><td align=""char"">6.68 (5.32-8.39)</td><td align=""char""><bold><.001</bold></td><td align=""char"">5.04 (3.97-6.32)</td><td align=""char""><bold><.001</bold></td></tr><tr><td>Arthroscopic</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td align=""char""> 29806</td><td align=""char"">616 (81.5)</td><td align=""char"">125,994 (90.1)</td><td align=""char"">0.48 (0.40-0.58)</td><td align=""char""><bold><.001</bold></td><td align=""char"">0.41 (0.34-0.50)</td><td align=""char""><bold><.001</bold></td></tr><tr><td>Bony</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td align=""char""> 23460</td><td align=""char""><11 (N/A)</td><td align=""char"">1074 (0.8)</td><td align=""char"">1.21 (0.57-2.55)</td><td align=""char"">.775</td><td align=""char"">1.36 (0.58-2.66)</td><td align=""char"">.425</td></tr><tr><td align=""char""> 23462</td><td align=""char"">44 (5.8)</td><td align=""char"">5280 (3.8)</td><td align=""char"">1.57 (1.16-2.14)</td><td align=""char""><bold>.005</bold></td><td align=""char"">1.84 (1.33-2.48)</td><td align=""char""><bold><.001</bold></td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><fn id=""tspara0015""><p><italic toggle=""yes"">EDS</italic>, Ehlers-Danlos syndrome; <italic toggle=""yes"">OR</italic>, odds ratio; <italic toggle=""yes"">aOR</italic>, adjusted odds ratio; <italic toggle=""yes"">CI</italic>, confidence interval.</p></fn><fn id=""tlspara0010l""><p>Bold represents statistical significance at <italic toggle=""yes"">P</italic> < 0.05.</p></fn></table-wrap-foot></table-wrap> Odds of a subsequent surgery were significantly higher for patients with EDS/HSD than for patients without EDS/HSD for all procedure types at both 1 year (aOR = 2.63, 95% CI [2.01, 3.39]) and 2 years (aOR = 2.38, 95% CI [1.88, 2.97]) following the initial stabilization procedure.

on the ipsilateral shoulder (OR = 1.87, 95% CI [1.07, 3.26]). However, after adjusting for potential confounding variables, this association was no longer statistically significant (aOR = 1.64, 95% CI [0.89, 2.77]). No other comparison reached the predetermined levels of statistical significance (<xref rid=""tbl2"" ref-type=""table"">Table II</xref>). The current study utilized a large database to evaluate differences in the surgical management of SI and the need for reoperation following open, arthroscopic, and bony procedures among a cohort of patients with and without preoperative diagnoses of EDS/HSD. The findings demonstrate the proportion of undergoing each procedure type differed across patient cohorts. Specifically, patients with EDS/HSD experienced significantly higher odds of undergoing open and bony procedures, while control patients experienced significantly higher odds of undergoing arthroscopic Bankart repair. In addition, odds of subsequent reoperation, whether contralateral or ipsilateral, were significantly higher for patients with EDS/HSD. Patients with EDS/HSD often present with multidirectional shoulder instability (MDI),<xref rid=""bib27"" ref-type=""bibr""><sup>27</sup></xref> for which open procedures are often used.<xref rid=""bib7"" ref-type=""bibr""><sup>7</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid=""bib16"" ref-type=""bibr""><sup>16</sup></xref> As such, the finding that patients with EDS/HSD are at increased odds of undergoing open procedures compared with control patients is reasonable because such procedures are often indicated for MDI. Furthermore, studies have demonstrated that combining soft-tissue and bony procedures results in favorable outcomes for patients with SI and hyperlaxity.<xref rid=""bib12"" ref-type=""bibr""><sup>12</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid=""bib21"" ref-type=""bibr""><sup>21</sup></xref> Our finding that patients with EDS/HSD are at higher odds of undergoing bony procedures may suggest that more providers are electing to combine such procedures for patients with hyperlaxity. The finding that control patients are at higher odds of undergoing arthroscopic repair is also reasonable given existing research. Studies suggest that hyperlaxity is a common risk factor for recurrent instability following arthroscopic Bankart repair.<xref rid=""bib33"" ref-type=""bibr""><sup>33</sup></xref> In fact, ligamentous laxity has been discussed as a key contraindication for arthroscopic labral repair.<xref rid=""bib32"" ref-type=""bibr""><sup>32</sup></xref> Arthroscopic techniques and procedures that rely heavily on reconstruction using the patient’s native tissues have increased risk of failure in patients with EDS/HSD given the weak underlying soft tissue characteristic of these conditions.<xref rid=""bib16"" ref-type=""bibr""><sup>16</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid=""bib28"" ref-type=""bibr""><sup>28</sup></xref> Given the relative rarity of EDS/HSD, there is limited research comparing the outcomes of surgical management of SI in this population with control populations. Our results show that patients with EDS/HSD experience higher odds of undergoing subsequent reoperation on either shoulder, possibly suggesting a greater threat of recurrent instability following surgical stabilization in this population. This finding supplements the results from smaller studies in this subject area. In a case series by Vavken et al,<xref rid=""bib31"" ref-type=""bibr""><sup>31</sup></xref> 15 adolescent patients with a clinical or genetic diagnosis of a connective tissue disease (defined as a Beighton score > 6) who had failed nonoperative treatment were followed up after undergoing open inferior capsular shift for atraumatic MDI.<xref rid=""bib31"" ref-type=""bibr""><sup>31</sup></xref> More than half of these patients experienced recurrent subluxation. Although this study did not compare rates of recurrence between patients with EDS/HSD and control patients, the results support our findings that patients with EDS/HSD are at risk of a secondary surgery following open procedures. In another case series, Voos et al<xref rid=""bib32"" ref-type=""bibr""><sup>32</sup></xref> evaluated outcomes of 83 patients following arthroscopic Bankart repair. They found that ligamentous laxity was significantly associated with risk of recurrent SI,<xref rid=""bib32"" ref-type=""bibr""><sup>32</sup></xref> suggesting that arthroscopic repair may be less optimal for patients with this characteristic. While this study did not compare rates of recurrence following different surgical techniques, the results offer support to our finding that patients with ligamentous laxity, as is characteristic of EDS/HSD, experience high odds of recurrent instability following arthroscopic procedures. Our results also showed that patients with EDS/HSD were specifically at increased risk of ipsilateral reoperation at 1 year following all procedure types compared with control patients. This finding aligns with prior research showing joint hyperlaxity as a key cause of shoulder surgery failure.<xref rid=""bib14"" ref-type=""bibr""><sup>14</sup></xref> Regardless of surgical technique, patients with EDS/HSD often lack soft-tissue strength ie, sufficient to effectively stabilize the shoulder,<xref rid=""bib3"" ref-type=""bibr""><sup>3</sup></xref> explaining the heightened odds of surgical revision in this population. We acknowledge several limitations to this study. While the use of a national database provides a large sample size, it does not allow for random sampling. The present study used ICD-9 and ICD-10 codes to identify patients with the diagnosis of EDS. As joint hypermobility is seen across all EDS subtypes, we included patients with ICD codes corresponding to classical, hypermobile, vascular, and unspecified subtypes of EDS. However, ICD codes may not accurately differentiate between the various subtypes of EDS. Regarding the inclusion of HSD in the current study, recent studies comparing clinical presentation between patients diagnosed with hEDS vs. those diagnosed with HSD have provided support for the argument that these diagnoses exist on the same physiological spectrum.<xref rid=""bib1"" ref-type=""bibr""><sup>1</sup></xref> As hEDS and HSD are often considered as a single entity for research purposes,<xref rid=""bib8"" ref-type=""bibr""><sup>8</sup></xref> our study considered these two diagnoses together. In addition, joint hypermobility is a characteristic of many clinical diagnoses,<xref rid=""bib30"" ref-type=""bibr""><sup>30</sup></xref> and patients with other specific connective tissue disorders (e.g., Marfan syndrome) were not included in the current study. Further investigation is warranted to identify nuances in surgical outcomes between the various subtypes of EDS and other connective tissue disorders to better understand whether specific genetic mutations influence risk of surgical failure. There is also potential for selection bias in the current findings, as the patients included in the EDS/HSD cohort are only those who have had access to formal diagnoses. There was a significant disproportion in the number of EDS patients and control patients identified, with the non-EDS cohort being far larger than the EDS cohort. Because of limited access to healthcare resources and defects in clinical evaluation, it is possible that some patients included in the non-EDS/HSD cohort may also have underlying connective tissue disorders that remain undiagnosed. Although our findings demonstrate that patients with EDS/HSD are at increased odds of undergoing open procedure types compared to patients with EDS, the present study did not evaluate factors associated with this differential surgical management of SI. Future research should evaluate the factors driving clinical decision-making to understand how providers design treatment plans for patients with joint hypermobility. This analysis relied on CPT codes for open, arthroscopic, and bony procedures for shoulder stabilization such that the accuracy of the data is subject to coding errors. Although alternative techniques for shoulder stabilization such as augmentation with remplissage and arthroscopic subscapularis augmentation have been reported in recent literature,<xref rid=""bib17"" ref-type=""bibr""><sup>17</sup></xref> they were not specifically evaluated in our analyses due to the limited precision of available CPT codes. While generalized hyperlaxity is commonly associated with multidirectional SI, other factors, including anatomical variations in capsulolabral or osseous anatomy and repetitive microtrauma as is common in overhead athletes, can contribute to MDI in the absence of hyperlaxity.<xref rid=""bib19"" ref-type=""bibr""><sup>19</sup></xref> The current study is limited in that the data do not account for these alternative contributors to MDI. Furthermore, as diagnosis and treatment of multidirectional instability is complex, it is possible that the higher odds of failure in the EDS/HSD cohort is also impacted by the increased prevalence of MDI compared with unilateral instability in this group. Future research should evaluate surgical outcomes across various classifications of SI in patients with connective tissue disorders. Our findings have important implications for clinicians treating SI in patients with EDS/HSD. Given the limited soft-tissue integrity in connective tissue disorders, first-line treatment for patients with hyperlaxity is often nonsurgical. Such treatment often consists of physical and occupational therapy that aims to improve joint stability and strengthen pericapsular muscular stabilizers.<xref rid=""bib22"" ref-type=""bibr""><sup>22</sup></xref> For patients without underlying hyperlaxity, clinicians may elect to proceed with surgical treatment sooner, especially in younger patients given the high rates of recurrent instability following conservative treatment in adolescent and young adult patients.<xref rid=""bib11"" ref-type=""bibr""><sup>11</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid=""bib22"" ref-type=""bibr""><sup>22</sup></xref> However, health-care providers should consider assessing all patients with SI for underlying hyperlaxity prior to developing a treatment plan. The present study demonstrates that the odds of undergoing open and bony procedures and need for subsequent surgery are significantly greater among patients with EDS/HSD than those among patients without known connective tissue disorders. These findings provide critical insights to patients with EDS/HSD and their clinical providers for developing personalized treatment plans for SI. Providers should educate patients with known hyperlaxity to make them aware of their increased odds of future reoperation. Surgeons should also prioritize assessment of ligamentous laxity in all patients presenting with SI and adjust individual treatment protocols accordingly.

"Cardiovascular, autonomic symptoms and quality of life in children with hypermobile Ehlers–Danlos syndrome",,"Ehlers–Danlos syndromes (EDS) are a group of connective tissue disorders that present with skin hyperextensibility, joint hypermobility, and tissue fragility, with the most common subtype being hypermobile Ehlers–Danlos syndrome (hEDS). EDS occurs in 1 in 5000 births, with hEDS accounting for most cases (80%–90%). Unlike other EDS subtypes, the genetic markers of hEDS are unknown and subsequently, hEDS is diagnosed based on the 2017 International Classification of the EDS clinical criteria.<sup>
<xref rid=""bibr1-20503121241287073"" ref-type=""bibr"">1</xref>
</sup> Due to the high prevalence of hypermobility that may resolve over time in the adolescent aged patients, a new pediatric joint hypermobility framework was developed, which is similar to the 2017 EDS International Classification Criteria for adults and was published in 2023.<sup>
<xref rid=""bibr2-20503121241287073"" ref-type=""bibr"">2</xref>
</sup> Many comorbidities are associated with hEDS, which includes autonomic symptoms and dysautonomia such as postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome (PoTS). The dysautonomia is impairing, frequently reported by adults with hEDS<sup>

<xref rid=""bibr5-20503121241287073"" ref-type=""bibr"">5</xref>
</sup> Additionally, PoTS is thought to be due to central nervous system dysfunction.<sup>
<xref rid=""bibr6-20503121241287073"" ref-type=""bibr"">6</xref>

<xref rid=""bibr5-20503121241287073"" ref-type=""bibr"">5</xref>
</sup> In patients with hEDS, the prevalence of PoTS is around 30% (150 times higher than in the general population).<sup>
<xref rid=""bibr4-20503121241287073"" ref-type=""bibr"">4</xref>

<xref rid=""bibr8-20503121241287073"" ref-type=""bibr"">8</xref>
</sup> However, there is scant literature on PoTS, dysautonomia, and cardiovascular autonomic symptoms in pediatric patients<sup>

</sup> This study aims to characterize cardiovascular diagnoses and symptoms in pediatric patients with hEDS and evaluate the impact of autonomic symptoms on QoL.    This is the first study to evaluate the impact of autonomic symptoms on QoL using the COMPASS-31 and PROMIS Pediatric-25 Profile v2.0 in pediatric patients with hEDS and addresses a gap in the literature.<sup>
<xref rid=""bibr11-20503121241287073"" ref-type=""bibr"">11</xref>
</sup> This study shows a high percentage of autonomic diagnoses seen in pediatric patients with hEDS and shows that cardiovascular and autonomic symptoms have a negative impact on QoL for patients with hEDS. Most patients (93%) in this study reported at least one cardiovascular symptom, which is similar to the adults with hEDS (89%).<sup>
<xref rid=""bibr4-20503121241287073"" ref-type=""bibr"">4</xref>
</sup> Therefore, cardiovascular symptoms appear to be a common feature in hEDS and are similar in magnitude for both pediatric and adult populations. This is not a universal feature in hEDS, as some patients reported no cardiovascular symptoms. Further, PoTS has been reported in 30% of adult patients with hEDS,<sup>
<xref rid=""bibr4-20503121241287073"" ref-type=""bibr"">4</xref>
</sup> while 21% of pediatric patients with hEDS had a PoTS diagnosis in this study. Both adult and pediatric percentages are significantly higher than the prevalence of PoTS in the general population (0.2%).<sup>
<xref rid=""bibr5-20503121241287073"" ref-type=""bibr"">5</xref>
</sup> Differences in the adult and pediatric diagnostic criteria for PoTS (adults > 30 bpm vs pediatrics > 40 bpm increase in heart rate with standing)<sup>
<xref rid=""bibr5-20503121241287073"" ref-type=""bibr"">5</xref>
</sup> could be one explanation for the difference in percentage observed between these two groups. Reports have shown the prevalence of dysautonomia in patients with hEDS to be between 31% and 94%,<sup>
<xref rid=""bibr18-20503121241287073"" ref-type=""bibr"">18</xref>
</sup> which encompasses the 47% diagnosed with dysautonomia in this study. Therefore, the rate of PoTS, dysautonomia, and autonomic symptoms is high in both the adult and pediatric hEDS populations. This further supports the idea that clinicians need to be knowledgeable about hEDS<sup>
<xref rid=""bibr19-20503121241287073"" ref-type=""bibr"">19</xref>
</sup> and associated comorbidities so that early screening can be performed and treatment delays can be avoided when patients with hEDS or autonomic symptoms present to care. The results of this study also indicate some differences in cardiac findings between children and adults. The 2017 International Classification of the EDS includes both MVP and ARD as potential diagnostic criteria for hEDS.<sup>
<xref rid=""bibr1-20503121241287073"" ref-type=""bibr"">1</xref>
</sup> Studies in adult patients with hEDS have found ranges of 6%–8% for MVP<sup><xref rid=""bibr4-20503121241287073"" ref-type=""bibr"">4</xref>,<xref rid=""bibr20-20503121241287073"" ref-type=""bibr"">20</xref></sup> and 0%–2% for ARD.<sup><xref rid=""bibr4-20503121241287073"" ref-type=""bibr"">4</xref>,<xref rid=""bibr20-20503121241287073"" ref-type=""bibr"">20</xref></sup> While our ARD frequency is consistent with these findings, we had no patients with MVP. One explanation is that MVP primarily impacts middle-aged adults with a prevalence of less than 1% in children and young adults.<sup>

</sup> These rates and the percentage of patients with trivial regurgitation are similar to the general population.<sup>
<xref rid=""bibr4-20503121241287073"" ref-type=""bibr"">4</xref>
</sup> Other echocardiogram findings in this study include aberrant right subclavian artery, doming and thickened aortic valves, and patent foramen ovale, none of which have been reported routinely in hEDS. The frequencies of these other echocardiogram findings are no greater than what is found in the general population.<sup><xref rid=""bibr22-20503121241287073"" ref-type=""bibr"">22</xref><xref rid=""bibr23-20503121241287073"" ref-type=""bibr""></xref>–<xref rid=""bibr24-20503121241287073"" ref-type=""bibr"">24</xref></sup> In summary, few patients had structural abnormalities on echocardiogram, and those seen were consistent with prevalence percentages in the general population. This suggests that the cardiovascular symptoms experienced by adult and pediatric patients with hEDS are primarily due to underlying autonomic symptoms rather than structural cardiovascular abnormalities. As none of the patients in this study had MVP and only one had mild ARD, both echocardiogram findings in the diagnostic criteria for hEDS, the role of echocardiogram in diagnosing hEDS in the pediatric and young adult population may be less relevant. However, we would still encourage routine echocardiograms to screen for cardiovascular structural disease, which appears to be rare but could have clinical treatment implications if identified. Patients in this study exhibited a significant autonomic symptom burden, similar to other studies in both adults and children with PoTS and hEDS.<sup>
<xref rid=""bibr25-20503121241287073"" ref-type=""bibr"">25</xref>
</sup> Additionally, the OI and pupillomotor subdomains were found to have the greatest contribution to the overall COMPASS-31 score in this study. A previous study found the subdomains with the greatest difference when comparing patients with PoTS to healthy controls were the OI and pupillomotor domains.<sup>
<xref rid=""bibr13-20503121241287073"" ref-type=""bibr"">13</xref>
</sup> Additionally, other studies have reported that the OI subdomain has the greatest contribution to the total COMPASS-31 score in patients with PoTS.<sup><xref rid=""bibr14-20503121241287073"" ref-type=""bibr"">14</xref>,<xref rid=""bibr15-20503121241287073"" ref-type=""bibr"">15</xref></sup> The OI and pupillomotor subdomains should be evaluated further as they may have the potential to be used in place of the full COMPASS-31 to assess autonomic symptom burden in patients with hEDS, which may be more expeditious in a clinical setting. However, further research is needed to confirm these findings. In all COMPASS-31 subsections, except for the vasomotor subdomain, higher subdomain scores in the COMPASS-31 correlated with higher total PROMIS scores. This suggests that higher autonomic symptom burden, correlates with a more negative impact on QoL. Additionally, results from this study align with previous literature that the pupillomotor and OI subdomains of the COMPASS-31 had the greatest correlation with total PROMIS scores. Thus, pupillomotor and OI symptoms most negatively impact HRQoL. This information could be beneficial to clinicians as they can focus more on the OI and pupillomotor subdomains of the COMPASS-31 when monitoring the autonomic symptom progression in patients with hEDS or PoTS. However, the secretomotor, gastrointestinal, and bladder subdomains may also have utility in evaluation as they also correlated with total PROMIS scores, but not as highly as pupillomotor and OI sub-domains. Limitations to this study include a small sample size and cross-sectional design, which precludes more sophisticated data analysis, including structural equation modeling and subgroup analysis of patients based on cardiovascular symptoms and diagnoses; however, this is a reasonable sample size for a rare disease. Limitations also include response bias as not all patients that were approached agreed to participate, and we did not collect data on subjects that did not agree to participate. Further, while an echocardiogram was ordered for all participants, not all participants obtained an echocardiogram, which led to incomplete data for cardiovascular evaluation. Additionally, orthostatic testing was not obtained on participants who did not endorse any autonomic symptoms, and a validated questionnaire for cardiovascular symptoms was not used to collect data; however, a standard cardiovascular review of symptoms was completed by all participants as part of their cardiovascular evaluation. Despite the limitations, this is the largest cohort of pediatric patients with hEDS and documentation of their cardiovascular and autonomic symptoms and diagnoses and the impact on QoL. Future studies in a larger population will allow a more detailed exploration of PROs and cardiovascular variables. This study shows that many children with hEDS have cardiovascular and autonomic symptoms, which have a significant impact on QoL. The rate of PoTS and dysautonomia are high in adult and pediatric hEDS populations, and clinicians managing patients with autonomic symptoms or hEDS need to be aware of these comorbidities so they can screen and initiate treatment sooner for these conditions. Interestingly, few patients with hEDS have structural abnormalities on echocardiogram, which suggests that the cardiovascular symptoms experienced by patients are due to autonomic symptoms. Orthostatic intolerance and pupillomotor symptoms are the strongest predictors of poor HRQoL. Based on these results, the OI and pupillomotor subdomains of the COMPASS-31 may be considered as a proxy for QoL in pediatric patients with hEDS and dysautonomia as they relate to cardiovascular and autonomic symptoms. This study confirms that cardiovascular conditions and autonomic symptoms are prevalent and do impact QoL in pediatric and young adult patients diagnosed with hEDS, and further research is needed to evaluate the long-term effect of cardiovascular symptoms on QoL.",N/A,11 10 2024
The prevalence of multisystem diagnoses among young patients with hypermobile Ehlers–Danlos syndrome and hypermobility spectrum disorder: A retrospective analysis using a large healthcare claims database,"Clinical features of hypermobile Ehlers–Danlos syndrome (hEDS) and hypermobility syndrome (HMS) have classically focused on dysfunctions related to the musculoskeletal system. A growing body of literature suggests substantial multisystemic involvement, although this has not been recapitulated in a pediatric/young adult population. Leveraging a large United States healthcare claim database illuminates multisystem disorders among patients diagnosed with hEDS and HMS in the age range of 10 to 24. This was a retrospective review of patient records within the de-identified healthcare claims database, PearlDiver. Patients with a diagnosis of hEDS or HMS, and those without these diagnoses who were seen for their annual physical examination, between the ages of 10 and 24, were queried for the presence of additional medical conditions. Descriptive statistics were used to define the frequency of multisystem diagnoses. Nineteen thousand seven hundred ninety hEDS patients, 17,509 HMS patients, and 4,959,713 patients from the general population were analyzed. Within 2 years following hEDS or HMS diagnosis, digestive disorders were the most prevalent diagnosis, followed by cardiovascular conditions. Digestive disorders occurred in 54.6% of patients with hEDS and 41.6% of patients with HMS, compared to 28.5% of the general population. Cardiovascular disorders occurred in 43.6% of patients with hEDS and 21.8% of patients with HMS compared to 10.3% of the general population. Anxiety, respiratory disorders, and developmental disorders occurred in approximately 25% of the hEDS group and 20% of the HMS group, compared to ~15% of the general population, all statistically significantly higher in the hEDS and HMS groups. This study highlights multisystem diagnoses within the pediatric hEDS/HMS populations. hEDS patients had higher rates of multisystem diagnoses compared to HMS patients. These results suggest a high multisystem disease burden for young hEDS/HMS patients. Future research is needed to understand the timing and presentation of clinical symptoms for this population.","Hypermobile Ehlers–Danlos syndrome (hEDS) and other hypermobility syndromes (HMS) are a clinically variable and genetically heterogenous group of hereditary connective tissue disorders characterized by joint hypermobility, tissue fragility, and connective tissue frailty.<sup>[<xref rid=""R1"" ref-type=""bibr"">1</xref>–<xref rid=""R3"" ref-type=""bibr"">3</xref>]</sup> HMS is most often used to describe a cohort of patients who have complications associated with joint hypermobility when a heritable connective tissue disorder is not present.<sup>[<xref rid=""R4"" ref-type=""bibr"">4</xref>–<xref rid=""R6"" ref-type=""bibr"">6</xref>]</sup> Hypermobile hEDS is thought to be an autosomal dominant disorder with incomplete and variable expressivity,<sup>[<xref rid=""R7"" ref-type=""bibr"">7</xref>]</sup> which is likely caused by an alteration in the genes that synthesize and process collagen, resulting in structural changes that predispose individuals to greater than normal motion and laxity.<sup>[<xref rid=""R8"" ref-type=""bibr"">8</xref>]</sup> This increased laxity can lead to multiple organ dysfunction,<sup>[<xref rid=""R4"" ref-type=""bibr"">4</xref>]</sup> such as cardiac valve dysfunction, gastroesophageal reflux, or spontaneous pneumothorax.

Even though HMS is sometimes considered to be a benign condition affecting only the joints and not leading to systemic manifestations,<sup>[<xref rid=""R5"" ref-type=""bibr"">5</xref>]</sup> this conclusion is not shown within the literature, and many patients report multisystem dysfunction.<sup>[<xref rid=""R9"" ref-type=""bibr"">9</xref>–<xref rid=""R11"" ref-type=""bibr"">11</xref>]</sup> For many patients with hypermobile hEDS or HMS, the prominent complaint is pain, due to abnormal joint mechanics, which is often wide-spread and long lasting.<sup>[<xref rid=""R12"" ref-type=""bibr"">12</xref>]</sup> Patients also present with a high rate of concomitant fatigue, headaches, autonomic issues, anxiety, gastrointestinal, and genitourinary complaints.<sup>[<xref rid=""R7"" ref-type=""bibr"">7</xref>,<xref rid=""R13"" ref-type=""bibr"">13</xref>–<xref rid=""R15"" ref-type=""bibr"">15</xref>]</sup> Misdiagnosis of these disorders is common, with up to 56% of patients being misdiagnosed initially, and 70% of patients receiving inappropriate treatment.<sup>[<xref rid=""R16"" ref-type=""bibr"">16</xref>,<xref rid=""R17"" ref-type=""bibr"">17</xref>]</sup> It is very difficult to diagnose hypermobile hEDS and HMS in children under the age of 5 as they present with higher Beighton scores and exhibit more flexibility than adults.<sup>[<xref rid=""R10"" ref-type=""bibr"">10</xref>,<xref rid=""R18"" ref-type=""bibr"">18</xref>]</sup> Adults also tend to stiffen with age, which may hinder patient reporting of symptoms.<sup>[<xref rid=""R7"" ref-type=""bibr"">7</xref>,<xref rid=""R17"" ref-type=""bibr"">17</xref>]</sup> Additionally, the lack of familiarity and awareness about hEDS among physicians often results in delayed diagnosis, in some cases more than 28 years from initial consult.<sup>[<xref rid=""R16"" ref-type=""bibr"">16</xref>,<xref rid=""R17"" ref-type=""bibr"">17</xref>]</sup> As such, these disorders significantly impact quality of life for these patients<sup>[<xref rid=""R11"" ref-type=""bibr"">11</xref>]</sup> manifesting across physical, psychological, and social domains.<sup>[<xref rid=""R19"" ref-type=""bibr"">19</xref>]</sup> Although these conditions are not curable, recognizing the diverse symptoms and training healthcare professionals across specialties could improve early diagnosis and intervention.<sup>[<xref rid=""R14"" ref-type=""bibr"">14</xref>,<xref rid=""R19"" ref-type=""bibr"">19</xref>]</sup> Currently, there is scarce data on hEDS due to limited research and lack of centers of excellence that specialize in care for these patients. Much of the medical literature uses small cohort studies consisting of samples with <100 adult patients.<sup>[<xref rid=""R17"" ref-type=""bibr"">17</xref>]</sup> Therefore, the purpose of this study was to explore the prevalence of systemic and multisystem disorders among pediatric and young adult patients with and without a diagnosis of hypermobile EDS and HMS by (1) describing the frequency of systemic and multisystem disorders in young patients (age 10–24) and (2) assessing if the frequency of these diagnoses differ between the general population and patients with a diagnosis of hEDS or HMS within a large US healthcare claims database.  The final study sample included 17,509 HMS patients, 19,970 hEDS patients, and 4,959,713 general population patients. The demographics of these patients were further assessed, as seen in Table <xref rid=""T2"" ref-type=""table"">2</xref>. Study samples were subdivided by sex, age, and region. Patients with hEDS or HMS come from all regions of the United States, however females are much more likely to be diagnosed with either hEDS (<italic toggle=""yes"">P</italic> < .0001, χ<sup>2</sup> = 3762.39) or HMS (<italic toggle=""yes"">P</italic> < .0001, χ<sup>2</sup> = 2852.18) than males as compared to the general population. Compared to the general population, hEDS patients (<italic toggle=""yes"">P</italic> < .001, χ<sup>2</sup> = 200.0) and HMS patients (<italic toggle=""yes"">P</italic> < .001, χ<sup>2</sup> = 138.8) tended to be older. Within the 2 years following hEDS or HMS diagnosis, digestive disorders were the most prevalent system diagnosis for all study samples (see Table <xref rid=""T3"" ref-type=""table"">3</xref>). Cardiovascular disorders are the second most common systemic disorder affecting the hEDS population. For HMS, anxiety is the second most common diagnosis. Respiratory disorders were also very common in hEDS (24.0%) and HMS (21.6%) compared to the general population, as were neurodevelopmental disorders. Additionally, while under 5% of all populations had a diagnosed eating disorder, addiction or obsessive compulsive disorder, all showed an increased prevalence in hEDS and HMS. These comparisons between hEDS and the general population, hEDS and HMS, and HMS and the general population were statistically significant with <italic toggle=""yes"">P</italic> values < .0001 in all cases, except depression, as seen in Table <xref rid=""T4"" ref-type=""table"">4</xref>. Equivalent rates of depression were seen in all groups (hEDS: 3.6% (<italic toggle=""yes"">P</italic> = .073), HMS: 3.7% (<italic toggle=""yes"">P</italic> = .590), general population: 3.8%(<italic toggle=""yes"">P</italic> = .780)). Tables <xref rid=""T5"" ref-type=""table"">5</xref> and <xref rid=""T6"" ref-type=""table"">6</xref> show additional breakdowns of the groups by age bracket and/or gender. This data breakdown shows a few interesting observations, as indicated in bold in Table <xref rid=""T6"" ref-type=""table"">6</xref>. Digestive disorders (<italic toggle=""yes"">P</italic> = .081, χ<sup>2</sup> = 3.0525), neurodevelopmental disorders (<italic toggle=""yes"">P</italic> = .483, χ<sup>2</sup> = 0.4922), and eating disorders (<italic toggle=""yes"">P</italic> = .140, χ<sup>2</sup> = 2.1806) are not different in the hEDS group and the general population in the 10 to 14 year old group. The rate of addictions is not different between any group in the 10 to 14 year old age bracket, and is not different in the HMS group as compared to the general population in the 15 to 19 year old age bracket as well (<italic toggle=""yes"">P</italic> = .102, χ<sup>2</sup> = 2.6740). Obsessive disorders are not different in the 10 to 14 year old age bracket between HMS and hEDS (<italic toggle=""yes"">P</italic> = .439, χ<sup>2</sup> = 0.5964), but are different compared to the general population. Depression was not statistically significantly different in any age group for HMS as compared to the general population, nor was it statistically significant for the 15 to 19 year group when comparing hEDS to the general population (<italic toggle=""yes"">P</italic> = .964, χ<sup>2</sup> = 0.0021) or HMS to hEDS (<italic toggle=""yes"">P</italic> = .744, χ<sup>2</sup> = 0.1059). The rate of multisystem disorders was also assessed in this population. Among patients with an hEDS or HMS diagnosis, 15.3% and 26.9%, respectively, had no additional systemic diagnosis, compared to 41% of the general population with no systemic diagnoses. Multisystem diagnoses were identified in 57.2% of patients with an hEDS diagnosis, 40.7% of patients with a HMS diagnosis, and 24.8% in the general population. Figure <xref rid=""F2"" ref-type=""fig"">2</xref> shows the breakdown of the number of multisystem diagnoses by each study group. This study explored the multisystem disorders in patients with hEDS and HMS by describing the prevalence of the different clinical manifestations, and the cumulative disease burden within this population. All conditions assessed herein are known comorbidities of hEDS and HMS. Patients with hEDS have a higher percentage of all comorbid conditions assessed, with the exception of depression. Likewise, HMS patients also have a higher percentage of all comorbid conditions assessed, albeit with lower rates than those diagnosed with hEDS. Results from our study indicate that 54.6% of hEDS and 41.6% of HMS patients were diagnosed with a gastrointestinal related condition. Gastrointestinal disorders in hEDS/HMS patient population have been well described in the literature.<sup>[<xref rid=""R20"" ref-type=""bibr"">20</xref>]</sup> Similarly to our study, Alomari et al which described patients with high frequencies of nausea (49.5%), constipation (45.4%), diarrhea (37.6%), and epigastric pain (49.8%).<sup>[<xref rid=""R13"" ref-type=""bibr"">13</xref>]</sup> The pathophysiological explanation for the occurrence of these symptoms is likely rooted in altered gastrointestinal function. In hEDS/HMS, excessive connective tissue elasticity causes an enlargement of the gastrointestinal wall which activates the mechanoreceptors responsible for the sensation of bloating.<sup>[<xref rid=""R20"" ref-type=""bibr"">20</xref>]</sup> In addition to causing pain from abdominal distention, this phenomenon alters abdominal motility and delays transit of gas.<sup>[<xref rid=""R21"" ref-type=""bibr"">21</xref>]</sup> In our cohort, approximately 43.6% of hEDS and 21.8% of HMS patients were evaluated for at least one cardiac condition, with the most common being tachycardia, followed by palpitations, and orthostatic hypotension. Autonomic nervous system dysregulation responsible for postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome (POTS) may present a more severe disease phenotype when occurring alongside hEDS.<sup>[<xref rid=""R22"" ref-type=""bibr"">22</xref>]</sup> Our trends are consistent with prior studies that cite the prevalence of POTS-like phenotype in hEDS/HMS cohorts between 5% and 41%.<sup>[<xref rid=""R23"" ref-type=""bibr"">23</xref>]</sup> This number is likely higher as diagnosis for POTS often takes years.<sup>[<xref rid=""R23"" ref-type=""bibr"">23</xref>]</sup> Connective tissue laxity and the inability to vasoconstrict observed in hEDS/HMS cause orthostatic blood pooling and orthostatic intolerance, which in combination with peripheral neuropathy, frequently seen in hEDS/HMS, may contribute to autonomic impairment.<sup>[<xref rid=""R22"" ref-type=""bibr"">22</xref>]</sup> The very high percentage of individuals with hEDS who also had anxiety (28.2%) or neurodevelopmental disorders like autism or attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) (23.7%), similar to Kindgren et al.<sup>[<xref rid=""R24"" ref-type=""bibr"">24</xref>]</sup> For patients with HMS, a quarter (25%) had a diagnosis of anxiety and 19.5% had a developmental disorder. Hypermobile EDS patients are at higher risk of mood disorders and developmental disorders than the general population,<sup>[<xref rid=""R25"" ref-type=""bibr"">25</xref>]</sup> though the studies looking at prevalence were performed on individuals over the age of 18 or used self-reports. Prevalence for anxiety disorders ranges from 9%<sup>[<xref rid=""R26"" ref-type=""bibr"">26</xref>]</sup> to 51.2%.<sup>[<xref rid=""R27"" ref-type=""bibr"">27</xref>]</sup> Our data falls more in line to the 26.6% prevalence found by Wasim et al.<sup>[<xref rid=""R28"" ref-type=""bibr"">28</xref>]</sup> The reason for the high rate of anxiety in the hEDS/ HMS population is not known. Perceived quality of life may be contributory to high levels of anxiety. A high rate of neurodevelopmental disorders has been found in patients with hEDS,<sup>[<xref rid=""R27"" ref-type=""bibr"">27</xref>,<xref rid=""R29"" ref-type=""bibr"">29</xref>]</sup> but prevalence varies considerably. Additionally, generalized joint laxity has been associated with developmental disorders, perhaps due to difficulties in motor planning associated with poor proprioception and motor coordination,<sup>[<xref rid=""R30"" ref-type=""bibr"">30</xref>]</sup> or perhaps due to the autonomic dysfunction seen in this population.<sup>[<xref rid=""R31"" ref-type=""bibr"">31</xref>]</sup> Interestingly, we did not see a high rate of depression in our cohort. Respiratory manifestations have been inconsistently described as sequela of hEDS and HMS in literature.<sup>[<xref rid=""R4"" ref-type=""bibr"">4</xref>]</sup> Morgan et al observed asthma in 23% of hEDS and 37% of HMS patients,<sup>[<xref rid=""R32"" ref-type=""bibr"">32</xref>]</sup> which is comparable to our population at 24% and 21.6%, respectively. Symptoms of asthma in hEDS/HMS may be attributed to aberrant mast cell activation which may contribute to dysfunction of multiple organ systems.<sup>[<xref rid=""R33"" ref-type=""bibr"">33</xref>]</sup> Our study found that females were diagnosed more frequently with hEDS (77.3%) or HMS (75.7%) than males, which is often reported.<sup>[<xref rid=""R16"" ref-type=""bibr"">16</xref>]</sup> Most of the patients in our cohort received their diagnoses between the ages of 15 to 19, and those who were diagnosed younger had fewer comorbidities. Possible explanations for this phenomenon are the influence of hormones and puberty on joint hypermobility and the higher predominance of chronic pain syndromes in women.<sup>[<xref rid=""R7"" ref-type=""bibr"">7</xref>,<xref rid=""R17"" ref-type=""bibr"">17</xref>,<xref rid=""R34"" ref-type=""bibr"">34</xref>]</sup> Therefore, pediatricians should be aware of hEDS/HMS presenting around puberty. No geographic differences were noted in these populations. Additionally, we found a very high rate of multiple diagnoses within the hEDS and HMS cohorts as compared to the general population.<sup>[<xref rid=""R9"" ref-type=""bibr"">9</xref>,<xref rid=""R35"" ref-type=""bibr"">35</xref>]</sup> Over 25% of the hEDS group have more than 3 diagnoses, which accounts for a huge disease burden in this population. This number of additional diagnoses is not surprising as a recent study by Halverson et al, showed that the average hEDS patient goes through more than 10 alternative diagnoses before a formal diagnosis of hEDS is reached, and it takes approximately 5 years before the patient is officially diagnosed.<sup>[<xref rid=""R36"" ref-type=""bibr"">36</xref>]</sup> As hEDS has the tendency to resemble symptoms of other medical conditions, it is important to consider a potential diagnosis in a patient with multiple extra-articular manifestations, especially in a young population. We excluded fibromyalgia and chronic fatigue from our cohort due to the overlap of these conditions with hEDS/HMS, though recent research<sup>[<xref rid=""R10"" ref-type=""bibr"">10</xref>]</sup> suggests that including these comorbidities within our population groups would be insightful. There are several limitations within this investigation. Firstly, our study utilized an insurance database, which limits our patient population to only those with insurance coverage, and limited conclusions to the statistical analyses and patient breakdowns available within the database. As a retrospective analysis, our study does not include follow-ups, the severity of the presentation for each disorder assessed, nor does it include date of diagnosis. Consequently, we lack significant information regarding the impact of the diagnosis on the quality of life of each patient and their comorbidities. Given that a large portion of patients are misdiagnosed,<sup>[<xref rid=""R17"" ref-type=""bibr"">17</xref>]</sup> it is possible that the lack of definitive diagnostic criteria for hEDS/HMS resulted in a much higher number of HMS and a much lower number of hEDS cases than in reality. Additionally, the subjective nature of symptom reporting by patients, may affect the accuracy of utilization of ICD-10 codes to represent these disorders. The ICD-10 code for HMS is an imperfect proxy for the variability of presentation seen within hypermobile patients. In conclusion, hEDS is a relatively rare genetic disorder, and as such it is difficult to find large pools of patients to assess. The true prevalence of comorbid conditions within this population is unknown. This study highlights the growing number of hEDS/HMS diagnoses in younger populations. Patients diagnosed with hEDS also had higher rates of multisystem diagnoses compared to HMS patients. These results suggest a high multisystem disease burden for younger hEDS/HMS patients. Future research is needed to understand the timing of onset and presentation of clinical symptoms in these patients. <bold>Conceptualization:</bold> Monika Kozyra, Regina Kostyun, Sara Strecker. <bold>Data curation:</bold> Regina Kostyun, Sara Strecker. <bold>Formal analysis:</bold> Regina Kostyun, Sara Strecker. <bold>Investigation:</bold> Monika Kozyra, Regina Kostyun, Sara Strecker. <bold>Methodology:</bold> Regina Kostyun, Sara Strecker. <bold>Resources:</bold> Monika Kozyra. <bold>Visualization:</bold> Regina Kostyun, Sara Strecker. <bold>Writing – original draft:</bold> Monika Kozyra, Regina Kostyun, Sara Strecker. <bold>Writing – review & editing:</bold> Monika Kozyra, Regina Kostyun, Sara Strecker.",N/A,11 10 2024
Assessing the Utility of a Patient-Facing Diagnostic Tool Among Individuals With Hypermobile Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome: Focus Group Study,,   ,N/A,2024
Spontaneous Bilateral Patellar Tendon Rupture in Patient with Ehlers–Danlos Syndrome: A Case Report,,"Patellar tendon ruptures are the third most common cause of disruption to the knee extensor mechanism [<xref rid=""ref1"" ref-type=""bibr"">1</xref>]. Ruptures may occur through trauma or spontaneously, defined as activities that should not disrupt the musculotendinous unit [<xref rid=""ref2"" ref-type=""bibr"">2</xref>]. Two theories exist on the pathogenesis of spontaneous ruptures: first, a microtrauma mechanical theory with traumatic bleeding into the synovial sheath with an intact fibrous sheath leading to increased intrasynovial pressure and hypoxia [<xref rid=""ref3"" ref-type=""bibr"">3</xref>] and second, a vascular theory based on age-related changes and sedentary lifestyle [<xref rid=""ref4"" ref-type=""bibr"">4</xref>, <xref rid=""ref5"" ref-type=""bibr"">5</xref>]. Patellar tendon ruptures are typically unilateral and traumatic, occurring in younger patients [<xref rid=""ref6"" ref-type=""bibr"">6</xref>]. Bilateral ruptures may be associated with systemic disorders that weaken collagen structures, such as renal failure [<xref rid=""ref7"" ref-type=""bibr"">7</xref>], systemic lupus erythematosus [<xref rid=""ref8"" ref-type=""bibr"">8</xref>], rheumatoid arthritis [<xref rid=""ref9"" ref-type=""bibr"">9</xref>], hyperparathyroidism [<xref rid=""ref10"" ref-type=""bibr"">10</xref>], and diabetes mellitus, connective tissue disorders, and medications including corticosteroids and anabolic hormones [<xref rid=""ref11"" ref-type=""bibr"">11</xref>, <xref rid=""ref12"" ref-type=""bibr"">12</xref>]. Patients may present with weak or absent active knee extension, difficulty weight-bearing, generalized knee pain, significant effusion, palpable infrapatellar soft tissue defect, or high-riding patella [<xref rid=""ref13"" ref-type=""bibr"">13</xref>]. Radiological investigations confirm the diagnosis including ultrasound and plain radiograph demonstrating a patella alta, indicated by the Insall-Salvati ratio more than 1.2 as calculated by the position of the patella relative to the tibial tuberosity [<xref rid=""ref13"" ref-type=""bibr"">13</xref>]. Non-operative management may be considered in cases of partial rupture or low-mobility patients with medical co-morbidities [<xref rid=""ref14"" ref-type=""bibr"">14</xref>]. Surgical management options include primary repair and reconstruction. The location determines the type of primary repair: Ruptures at the origin (type 1) may have transosseous repair, mid-substance tears may have end-to-end repair (type 2), and distal avulsion tears (type 3) may require anchor repair [<xref rid=""ref15"" ref-type=""bibr"">15</xref>]. Reconstruction with autograft or allograft may be required in severe or subacute cases [<xref rid=""ref16"" ref-type=""bibr"">16</xref>]. Ehlers–Danlos syndrome (EDS), a genetic connective tissue disorder leading to altered fibrillar collagen metabolism [<xref rid=""ref17"" ref-type=""bibr"">17</xref>], is diagnosed through examination, family history, and genetic testing. There are six subtypes: Classical, hypermobility, vascular, kyphoscoliosis, arthrochalasia, and dermatosparaxis [<xref rid=""ref18"" ref-type=""bibr"">18</xref>]. EDS is characterized by generalized joint hypermobility, atrophic scarring, excessive bruising, delayed wound healing, and increased skin elasticity [<xref rid=""ref19"" ref-type=""bibr"">19</xref>]. Knee instability is the most commonly involved joint, possibly contributed to by quadriceps and hamstring weakness [<xref rid=""ref20"" ref-type=""bibr"">20</xref>]. Collagen fibers constitute 70–80% of the patellar tendon dry weight [<xref rid=""ref2"" ref-type=""bibr"">2</xref>], with EDS patellar tendons demonstrating lower biomechanical properties compared to controls [<xref rid=""ref21"" ref-type=""bibr"">21</xref>]. Healthy patellar tendons which require a force of 17.5 times the patient’s body weight to rupture [<xref rid=""ref22"" ref-type=""bibr"">22</xref>], though EDS patients may require less force. There have been three cases of spontaneous patellar tendon rupture in patients with EDS reported in the literature. First, Moretti et al. reported a 13-year-old child with EDS who sustained bilateral spontaneous patellar tendon ruptures after a fall while walking and underwent primary tendon repair 72 h following the injury [<xref rid=""ref23"" ref-type=""bibr"">23</xref>]. Takata et al. reported a 27-year-old male with classic EDS who sustained a unilateral spontaneous patellar tendon rupture while walking downstairs and underwent primary repair with semitendinosus and gracilis augmentation 5 days following the injury [<xref rid=""ref24"" ref-type=""bibr"">24</xref>]. Finally, Iacono et al. reported a 23-year-old man with vascular EDS who sustained a chronic patellar tendon tear 2.5 years following primary tendon repair [<xref rid=""ref25"" ref-type=""bibr"">25</xref>]. The reported case describes an adult patient with classical EDS who sustained bilateral spontaneous patellar tendon ruptures while pushing a heavy trolley. The patient underwent direct tendon repair and obtained good post-operative recovery at 12-month follow-up. A 45-year-old male presented to the Emergency Department after falling while pushing a heavy trolley. The reported mechanism involved the trolley beginning to fall, with the patient attempting to balance the trolley, leading to eccentric contraction of quadriceps muscles. Immediately following the injury, the patient was unable to mobilize. He was diagnosed with classical EDS on genetic testing as a child, presenting with skin hyperextensibility, joint hypermobility, and hypertrophic scars on bony protrusions. He did not have any other medical conditions or take regular medications. He worked as a retail assistant at a variety of department stores and was independent with activities of daily living. This reports the first adult EDS patient who sustained bilateral patellar tendon ruptures and describes the operative management through direct repair. Furthermore, the case expands on the paucity of literature surrounding operative management for EDS patients with patellar tendon ruptures and post-operative outcomes. A literature review of unilateral or bilateral patellar tendon ruptures in pediatric or adult patients with EDS using PubMed, MEDLINE, and Scopus was conducted. The search was limited to full text and English language, which yielded three suitable case reports as summarized in <xref rid=""T1"" ref-type=""table"">Table 1</xref>. All three patients were male, with an average age of 21 years (range, 13–27 years). Two cases were acute patellar tendon ruptures, after a fall while walking (bilateral) and a fall down stairs (unilateral). One case was a unilateral chronic patellar tendon tear diagnosed 2.5 years following initial bilateral patellar tendon ruptures managed with primary end-to-end repairs. All patients underwent surgical management, with the two acute cases undergoing primary repair ± augmentation with autograft and the chronic tear undergoing reconstruction with allograft. The patient in the presented case report was 45 years old at the time of injury, which is higher than the previously reported cases in EDS patients (average: 21 years). However, the patient’s age is similar to the average age of 37.1 years reported by Fernandes et al. in a systematic review of simultaneous bilateral patellar tendon ruptures [<xref rid=""ref28"" ref-type=""bibr"">28</xref>]. Previous literature has hypothesized age-related histological changes that may predispose patellar tendon ruptures, such as decreased elasticity, altered osteotendinous junction blood supply, and collagen degeneration [<xref rid=""ref23"" ref-type=""bibr"">23</xref>]. While the low-energy mechanism of injury reported by the patient was similar to past case reports, age-related changes in conjunction with predisposition secondary to EDS may contribute to bilateral patellar tendons rupturing during eccentric contraction. Acute patellar tendon ruptures often undergo surgical management. Fernandes et al. reviewed 45 cases of spontaneous bilateral patellar tendon ruptures managed surgically, with 88.9% (40/45) patients receiving direct primary repair and 11.1% (5/45) patients undergoing reconstruction [<xref rid=""ref28"" ref-type=""bibr"">28</xref>]. However, there is no consensus in the literature on surgical techniques in patients with connective tissue abnormalities [<xref rid=""ref20"" ref-type=""bibr"">20</xref>], with differences in management noted between the previously reported case studies of EDS patients with acute patellar tendon ruptures. Moretti et al., described primary repair in a pediatric EDS patient 72 h following injury with primary repair utilizing a Vicryl suture (Johnson and Johnson, Bruxelles, Belgium) through a modified Bunnell technique and reinforced with wire cerclage, followed by post-operative immobilization with a brace locked at full extension [<xref rid=""ref23"" ref-type=""bibr"">23</xref>]. Takata et al., described primary repair in an adult patient 5 days following unilateral patellar tendon rupture using FiberWire (Arthrex, Munich, Germany) transosseous sutures through a Krackow’s technique and augmented with semitendinosus and gracilis muscle, followed by post-operative immobilization in a long-leg cylinder cast [<xref rid=""ref24"" ref-type=""bibr"">24</xref>]. At 12 months, the patient was able to walk without crutches and obtained an active range of motion to 145° flexion without extension lag. In comparison, the reported case describes an acute primary patellar tendon repair with utilizing the Krackow technique, reinforced with transosseous tunnels without autograft or allograft augmentation, and post-operative immobilization with a brace locked at full extension. At 12 months, the patient achieved similar clinical outcomes as the two previous case reports. While there is no reported medium or long-term follow-up for bilateral patellar tendon repairs in the literature [<xref rid=""ref28"" ref-type=""bibr"">28</xref>], it is interesting to note Iacono et al., reported an EDS patient diagnosed with a unilateral chronic patellar tendon tear 2.5 years following bilateral primary end-to-end repairs at another institution [<xref rid=""ref25"" ref-type=""bibr"">25</xref>]. Further research is required to explore surgical repair and reconstruction techniques for patients with connective tissue disorders and subsequent post-operative outcomes. This case reports the first bilateral spontaneous patellar tendon rupture in an adult patient with EDS, who underwent operative management through primary tendon repair and returned to pre-injury function. As there is insufficient evidence for comparison between operative techniques, it is recommended that management should be individualized based on patient factors, concomitant injuries, and pre-injury functional capacity.",N/A,10 2024
"Pulmonary <italic toggle=""yes"">Mycobacterium avium</italic> complex infection with vascular Ehlers–Danlos syndrome: A case report","A female patient developed multiple intestinal perforations at 31 and 43 years of age. Because of her family history of pneumothorax and intestinal perforation, Ehlers–Danlos syndrome (EDS) was suspected when she visited our hospital at 52 years. She was diagnosed with vascular Ehlers–Danlos syndrome (vEDS) and developed bilateral external iliac artery dissection. A CT scan at the time of admission revealed granular and infiltrative shadows in both lungs with bronchiectasis. The patient was also diagnosed with <italic toggle=""yes"">Mycobacterium avium</italic> complex (MAC) pulmonary disease, and drug susceptibility to clarithromycin was confirmed. After treatments with rifampicin, ethambutol, and clarithromycin were started, the acid-fast bacilli cultures taken from sputum were negative, and respiratory symptoms partially improved after about 1 month. vEDS is reportedly associated with lung diseases, such as pneumothorax and cystic lung lesions, but there are few reports of respiratory infections with vEDS. Moreover, there are no reports of complications associated with MAC disease. We report a case of vEDS with rare complications and suggest the possible mechanism of infection.","Ehlers–Danlos syndrome (EDS) is a genetic disease characterized by hyperextensibility of the skin and joints and fragility of various tissues. Currently, it is classified into 13 subtypes [<xref rid=""bib1"" ref-type=""bibr"">1</xref>], and clinical criteria are provided for each classification. Vascular Ehlers–Danlos syndrome (vEDS) is rare and is known as the most severe subtype. The main pathological finding of vEDS is a decrease in collagen III due to the <italic toggle=""yes"">COL3A1</italic> gene mutation. The weakness of the blood vessels and intestinal tracts causes vascular rupture and intestinal perforation. Cystic pulmonary lesions in hematogenous sputum may occur frequently due to a decrease in lung elastic fibers [<xref rid=""bib2"" ref-type=""bibr"">2</xref>]. Complications of respiratory diseases, such as bronchiectasis and pneumothorax, have also been reported [<xref rid=""bib4"" ref-type=""bibr"">[4]</xref>, <xref rid=""bib5"" ref-type=""bibr"">[5]</xref>, <xref rid=""bib6"" ref-type=""bibr"">[6]</xref>]. A female patient who was diagnosed with vEDS developed bilateral iliac artery dissection, and a chest CT image taken at that time incidentally revealed a left pneumothorax and granular and infiltrative shadows in both lungs. <italic toggle=""yes"">M. avium</italic> was detected in two separate cultures from sputum samples, and she was diagnosed with pulmonary MAC disease. Pulmonary MAC disease has been reported to be associated with some chronic respiratory diseases, such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and bronchiectasis. However, despite reports of MAC disease with vEDS being rare, we report on the course of this rare condition in this case. A 52-year-old woman underwent surgical treatment at another hospital for intestinal perforation. EDS was suspected due to the fragility of the intestinal tissues during surgery and a family history of pneumothorax and intestinal perforation. The patient consulted the genetics department of our hospital, where genetic testing detected a <italic toggle=""yes"">COL3A1</italic> gene mutation. Based on the patient's past medical history and family history suggestive of EDS, the diagnosis of vEDS was confirmed, and the patient has since visited the outpatient clinic regularly. She visited our hospital for chief complaints of sudden abdominal pain at the periumbilical region and back pain, and was admitted to the hospital with bilateral external iliac artery dissection detected on CT scans. At the same time, chest X-rays revealed granular and infiltrative shadows in both lungs with bronchiectasis and a left pneumothorax, and she subsequently consulted our respiratory department. In her medical history, she developed idiopathic small bowel perforation and peritonitis at 32 years, and at 44 years she underwent surgical treatment for perforation of the descending colon, receiving a colostomy. She also had a history of hypertension and reflux esophagitis and had undergone balloon dilatation for esophageal stricture. In her family history, her son had a history of pneumothorax and intestinal perforation, and her daughter also had a history of pneumothorax. Analysis of the gene revealed <italic toggle=""yes"">COL3A1</italic>:c.2337G > A which showed single base skipping in the last nucleotide of exon 33, and she was diagnosed with vEDS using genetic testing. She had a history of smoking two cigarettes daily for 6 years but no history of drinking alcohol. Findings on admission: height 153 cm, weight 29 kg, body mass index (BMI) 12.4, body temperature 36.1 °C, blood pressure 117/71 mmHg, pulse rate 66 bpm, and arterial oxygen saturation of pulse oximetry 97 %. No abnormal breath sounds were heard, tenderness was observed below the umbilicus, and there were signs of skin hyperextension in the upper limbs. Laboratory findings are shown in <xref rid=""tbl1"" ref-type=""table"">Table 1</xref>. Chest X-ray examination on admission showed granular shadows in both the right and left upper lobes and infiltration in the left lower lung field.

Her blood pressure was controlled, and bilateral external iliac artery dissection and left pneumothorax spontaneously resolved with only conservative treatment. Based on CT findings, a chronic respiratory infection, including possible mycobacterial infection, was suspected, and sputum tests were conducted. Bacteriological tests showed only the growth of resident bacteria, but acid-fast bacterial tests over three days revealed that the sample on the first day indicated tuberculosis and was MAC PCR negative. The smear from the second day showed a few bacteria, and cultures from the second and third days grew <italic toggle=""yes"">Mycobacterium avium</italic> (<italic toggle=""yes"">M. avium</italic>). The minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) for <italic toggle=""yes"">M. avium</italic> were: streptomycin 16 μg/mL, ethambutol (EB) 8 μg/mL, kanamycin 16 μg/mL, rifampicin (RFP) 0.125 μg/mL, levofloxacin 0.03 μg/mL, rifabutin 4 μg/mL, clarithromycin (CAM) 1 μg/mL, ethionamide 16 μg/mL, and amikacin 16 μg/mL. The final diagnosis was CAM-sensitive pulmonary MAC infection with no drug resistance. There were no cavitary changes in the pneumonia, and she was diagnosed with the nodular-bronchiectasis type. On day 55, she started treatment with three drugs: RFP 300 mg/day, EB 500 mg/day, and CAM 400 mg/day. On day 92, both the smear and culture results of a sputum mycobacterial test were negative and remained negative. A CT scan also showed improvement in infiltration shadows in the bilateral lower regions. Since gastrointestinal symptoms did not appear, the dose of CAM was increased to 600 mg/day on day 272, and the treatments were completed on day 804. After the treatments, the pulmonary MAC disease remained stable, and the sputum mycobacterial test remained negative. As for the course of the treatment for vascular EDS, she developed a right spontaneous pneumothorax on day 92 and a right intercostal artery rupture on day 406, both of which improved with rest and conservative management (<xref rid=""fig2"" ref-type=""fig"">Fig. 2</xref>, <xref rid=""fig3"" ref-type=""fig"">Fig. 3</xref>).<fig id=""fig2""><label>Fig. 2</label><caption><p>The treatment with RFP, EB, and CAM continued for over 1 year after the culture was negative from day 55 to day 804.

EDS is classified into 13 subtypes [<xref rid=""bib1"" ref-type=""bibr"">1</xref>]: each has mutations in genes or enzymes that produce a specific collagen. Because of the rarity of EDS, its exact incidence and prevalence are unknown, and there are no effective treatments for this disease. Among these subtypes, vEDS is often reported as being the most severe. Its frequency in past cohort studies was estimated at 1/50,000–1/250,000 people, and the median survival age as young as 48 years [<xref rid=""bib3"" ref-type=""bibr"">3</xref>]. The diagnostic criteria for vEDS include standard symptoms (thin and semi-skinned skin) and the presence of two or more of transparent and ruptured arteries/intestines/uterus, easy bruising, and characteristic facial symptoms (large eyes, small chin, sunken cheeks, thin nose and lips, and lobeless ears). Abnormality in type III procollagen production in cultured skin fibroblasts or <italic toggle=""yes"">COL3A1</italic> gene mutations is also observed. The main pathology is a decrease in collagen III, which forms connective tissue, thus causing fragility of blood vessels and the intestinal tract. Since collagen III also plays an important role as extracellular matrix (ECM) in the lungs, complications of pneumothorax, hemothorax, hemoptysis, and hemocystic lung lesions have been reported when collagen is deficient [<xref rid=""bib4"" ref-type=""bibr"">[4]</xref>, <xref rid=""bib5"" ref-type=""bibr"">[5]</xref>, <xref rid=""bib6"" ref-type=""bibr"">[6]</xref>, <xref rid=""bib7"" ref-type=""bibr"">[7]</xref>, <xref rid=""bib8"" ref-type=""bibr"">[8]</xref>].

Bathrooms are reportedly a source of infection, and the incidence rate is higher in those who are frequently exposed to soil, such as farmers and gardeners [<xref rid=""bib45"" ref-type=""bibr"">45</xref>,<xref rid=""bib46"" ref-type=""bibr"">46</xref>]. Although environmental factors are involved, comorbid chronic respiratory diseases such as COPD and bronchiectasis in the host are also reportedly a factor [<xref rid=""bib47"" ref-type=""bibr"">47</xref>]. Despite being a common bacterium that patients can be exposed to on a daily basis, the symptoms are limited or lacking in some, so the genetic etiology may be responsible. In recent years, genetic abnormalities in the <italic toggle=""yes"">CHP2</italic> region have been shown to be involved in the onset of the disease [<xref rid=""bib48"" ref-type=""bibr"">48</xref>]. However, the mechanism of infection remains unclear. As far as we have investigated, only one case of fungal endocarditis has been reported as a combination of vEDS and infection [<xref rid=""bib49"" ref-type=""bibr"">49</xref>]. Although there are no reports of comorbidity with vEDS and pulmonary MAC disease, the following points are assumed to be grounds for considering it as a risk factor for the development of MAC disease. First, it has been demonstrated that <italic toggle=""yes"">M. avium</italic> binds to damaged non-ciliated epithelium in patient tissues. MAC also possibly adheres to the ECM in areas of epithelial injury via fibroblast activation proteins and to mucus with a fibrous appearance via another adhesin. Chronic epithelial damage reportedly exposes the ECM and reduces mucus clearance, which is thought to increase the likelihood of respiratory tract infection in MAC [<xref rid=""bib50"" ref-type=""bibr"">50</xref>]. It is widely known that ECM plays the role of a scaffold for cell and matrix adhesion, for example, in fibronectin and collagen. The main pathology of vascular EDS is the abnormal production of collagen III, which is thought to lead to decreased ECM function and cause MAC infection. The second point is the low nutritional status of the patient, which can lead to the development of chronic lower respiratory tract infections. The above-mentioned cohort study reported that intestinal perforation itself has no correlation with mortality rate, but vascular damage is correlated with mortality rate and survival cases in patients with a history of surgery for intestinal perforation. As a result, it is thought that when patients are in such a state, such as after a stoma has been created, they are likely to be at a higher risk of decreased intestinal function and malnutrition compared to healthy individuals. It is thought that our patient's very low BMI and associated malnutrition created an environment conducive to MAC infection, which put her at risk for developing the disease. The third point is the global increase in incidence rates for pulmonary nontuberculous mycobacterial disease (PNTMD) [<xref rid=""bib51"" ref-type=""bibr"">51</xref>].Especially, incidence rates of PNTMD in Japan are the highest in the world. The reasons for the increase in incidence rates may be the simplified diagnosis, increased awareness by medical staff, population aging, and increased frequency of medical checkups with CT [<xref rid=""bib52"" ref-type=""bibr"">52</xref>]. Many cases of vEDS with cystic lesions and several nodules have been reported. It is difficult to differentiate between vEDS and PNTMD in CT findings. Furthermore, the acute onset of severe conditions in vEDS patients may prevent diagnosis of PNTMD from sputum examination. Additionally, as mentioned above, genetic abnormalities that are correlated with MAC disease in the host have been discovered, but the genes associated with the currently known EDS patients and the host with MAC disease are different, and the chromosomes of each gene exist in separate regions. Currently there is no evidence for genetic involvement between MAC and EDS. International guidelines for the treatment of nontuberculous mycobacterial (NTM) pulmonary disease have been revised frequently, and although treatment regimens have been established for relatively frequently occurring bacterial species, there are many cases in which the disease is difficult to treat. In cases of MAC disease, treatment based on macrolide and amikacin susceptibility is recommended, and in cases of macrolide susceptibility, combination therapy with three drugs, including macrolides (clarithromycin or azithromycin, rifampicin or rifabutin, and ethambutol), is recommended as standard therapy. On the other hand, in cases of cavitation formation, severe bronchodilation, or macrolide resistance, concomitant use of amikacin or streptomycin is recommended, and in refractory cases, use of amikacin liposome inhalation suspension is also recommended. The treatment period should continue for 1 year after confirmation of negative bacterial excretion from sputum. In this case, the patient was diagnosed with macrolide-sensitive MAC disease due to the nodular-type shadow, so three-drug therapy of clarithromycin, rifampicin, and ethambutol was performed as standard therapy for about 2 years. As a result, sputum excretion decreased, and the imaging findings partially improved. After finishing treatment, sputum excretion remained decreased. We treated a case of pulmonary MAC disease complicated by vEDS that suggested vEDS may be a risk factor for the development of NTM pulmonary disease. Currently, there is no curative treatment for vEDS, so the management of complications is important. In summary, if we see respiratory diseases in vEDS patients, we need to check for chronic respiratory infections. Informed consent was obtained for this experimentation.

These disorders result from defects in the structure, production, or processing of collagen or related proteins, which are essential components of connective tissue [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR2"">2</xref>].

The convergence of EDS, innate immunity dysfunction, and the aftermath of a motor vehicle collision leading to below-the-knee amputation (BKA) and hardware fixation presents a distinctive clinical challenge. Here, we present a case that delineates the intricate management complexities inherent in such a multifaceted presentation, specifically focusing on the emergence of <italic toggle=""yes"">Mycobacterium goodii</italic> and <italic toggle=""yes"">Priestia endophytica</italic> infections, the latter being an organism not previously identified as a human pathogen. A 26-year-old man with EDS presented after a motor vehicle collision in Arizona resulting in significant trauma and soil-contaminated wounds to his left lower extremity and underwent BKA and femoral intramedullary nail placement. After a three-week hospitalization, he was discharged with two unspecified antibiotics. Approximately one week after discharge, the patient presented to the emergency department at our institution with severe left leg pain and purulent drainage from an anterior thigh surgical incision (Fig. <xref rid=""Fig1"" ref-type=""fig"">1</xref>A; Table <xref rid=""Tab1"" ref-type=""table"">1</xref>). He was hospitalized and underwent surgical debridement after a two-week delay due to unexpected circumstances. The area of debridement measured approximately 44 cm × 15 cm × 2 cm with extensive purulence. Notably, antibiotics were not administered prior to this surgical intervention.

 Intraoperative tissue cultures collected during surgical debridement yielded grey-white, gamma-hemolytic colonies with a ground glass appearance, accompanied by long Gram-positive bacilli on Gram stain (Fig. <xref rid=""Fig1"" ref-type=""fig"">1</xref>). Initially, <italic toggle=""yes"">Bacillus anthracis</italic> was considered and was excluded by molecular testing conducted by the Houston Health Department. Thereafter, our laboratory performed further analysis using Matrix-Assisted Laser Desorption/Ionization Time-of-Flight Mass Spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) (Bruker, Billerica MA) and sequencing of the 16S rDNA gene on both isolates from two tissue cultures collected from the first debridement and before initiation of antibiotics, which identified the organism as <italic toggle=""yes"">Priestia endophytica</italic> (NCBI GenBank accession # PP533212, 1459 base pairs, 100% query coverage, and 100% identity with OP437686), previously known as <italic toggle=""yes"">Bacillus endophyticus</italic> [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR4"">4</xref>]. Post-operatively, the patient received vancomycin and later daptomycin due to suboptimal vancomycin levels. As <italic toggle=""yes"">P. endophytica</italic> was the only organism isolated from tissue samples from his first debridement, daptomycin was continued and later transitioned to doxycycline based on susceptibility testing (Table <xref rid=""Tab2"" ref-type=""table"">2</xref>) and extrapolation of the efficacy of doxycycline from <italic toggle=""yes"">Bacillus</italic> species. Subsequent surgical interventions involved incision and drainage procedures every 2–4 days for approximately 3 weeks, culminating in a bone graft placement and permanent intramedullary nail placement (Fig. <xref rid=""Fig1"" ref-type=""fig"">1</xref>B). The post-operative course was complicated by wound dehiscence (Fig. <xref rid=""Fig1"" ref-type=""fig"">1</xref>C). During hospitalization, aerobic, anaerobic, fungal, and acid-fast bacilli (AFB) cultures were collected as a standard-of-care protocol on the first, fourth, and eleventh debridement. Including the first debridement, all AFB cultures eventually were identified as <italic toggle=""yes"">Mycobacterium goodii. P. endophytica</italic> was not isolated again after initial debridement and targeted antibiotic therapy. Empiric trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (TMP/SMX) was initiated for the treatment of <italic toggle=""yes"">M. goodii</italic>, as it is typically susceptible to SMX. Doxycycline was continued for <italic toggle=""yes"">P. endophytica</italic>, and as a second agent for empiric treatment of <italic toggle=""yes"">M. goodii</italic>. Remarkably, the patient’s wound began to heal promptly upon initiating combination antimicrobial therapy (Fig. <xref rid=""Fig1"" ref-type=""fig"">1</xref>D). The susceptibility profile obtained from ARUP Laboratories (Salt Lake City, UT) (Table <xref rid=""Tab2"" ref-type=""table"">2</xref>) confirmed that this isolate of <italic toggle=""yes"">M. goodii</italic> was susceptible to both TMP/SMX and doxycycline. Therefore, this targeted antibiotic regimen was continued throughout the rest of his hospitalization and on discharge. The patient recovered well without any complications at the 3-month follow-up, with a plan to continue treatment for 6–12 months depending on clinical progress. As there are no clinical practice guidelines to direct the specific treatment of <italic toggle=""yes"">M. goodii</italic> infections, we chose a prolonged duration based on clinical experience, extrapolating evidence from recommendations for tissue and skeletal infections caused by related nontuberculous mycobacteria (NTM) [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR5"">5</xref>].

 Throughout his hospitalization, the patient’s known history of EDS, poorly healing wounds, and frequent need for debridement of infected tissues prompted the investigation into possible immune dysfunction. Laboratory findings (Table <xref rid=""Tab3"" ref-type=""table"">3</xref>) were remarkable for diminished percent and absolute natural killer (NK) cells (CD16 + and CD56+), suggestive of innate cell-mediated immune system dysfunction. Further immunologic investigations are ongoing to determine the significance of this lymphocytopenia and its potential contribution to the infection.

 <italic toggle=""yes"">P. endophytica</italic> was recovered from the hardware infection, along with <italic toggle=""yes"">M. goodii</italic> in this patient. <italic toggle=""yes"">P. endophytica</italic>, a Gram-positive, rod-shaped, spore-forming bacterium in the family <italic toggle=""yes"">Bacillaceae</italic> [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR4"">4</xref>], was previously known as <italic toggle=""yes"">Bacillus endophyticus</italic> (<ext-link ext-link-type=""uri"" http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Taxonomy/Browser/wwwtax.cgi?mode=Info&id=135735"">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Taxonomy/Browser/wwwtax.cgi?mode=Info&id=135735</ext-link>). Originally isolated from plant tissue, particularly cotton, <italic toggle=""yes"">P. endophytica</italic> has been explored for its potential role in enhancing crop productivity [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR6"">6</xref>, <xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR7"">7</xref>]. It is characterized as an endophytic bacterium that colonizes the internal tissues of plants without causing disease [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR8"">8</xref>]. The identification of <italic toggle=""yes"">P. endophytica</italic> as a pathogen in human infections is unprecedented [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR9"">9</xref>]. Macroscopically and microscopically, <italic toggle=""yes"">P. endophytica</italic> closely resembles <italic toggle=""yes"">Bacillus anthracis</italic>, the causative agent of anthrax, posing challenges in differentiation. On Sheep Blood agar (SBA), <italic toggle=""yes"">P. endophytica</italic> colonies exhibited a white or grey-white, non-hemolytic appearance with irregular edges and a ground-glass appearance. Additionally, comma-shaped projections from the colony edge produced “Medusa-head” colonies (Fig. <xref rid=""Fig2"" ref-type=""fig"">2</xref>A). Gram staining (Fig. <xref rid=""Fig2"" ref-type=""fig"">2</xref>B) revealed endospore-forming, box-shaped rods of <italic toggle=""yes"">P. endophytica</italic> arranged in short to long chains. Lekota et al. [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR10"">10</xref>], through whole-genome shotgun sequencing, demonstrated the absence of <italic toggle=""yes"">B. anthracis</italic>-related plasmids or virulence genes in <italic toggle=""yes"">P. endophytica</italic> genomes. Due to the similarity between <italic toggle=""yes"">P. endophytica</italic> and <italic toggle=""yes"">B. anthracis</italic> and the latter’s classification as a biosafety level 3 (BSL-3) agent, molecular methods are typically utilized to rule out <italic toggle=""yes"">B. anthracis</italic> before further identification using MALDI-TOF MS or other manipulations in a clinical sentinel laboratory.

 In our case, while the possibility of environmental contamination cannot be completely ruled out, the isolation of <italic toggle=""yes"">P. endophytica</italic> from intraoperative cultures, particularly in two out of three initial surgical tissue samples collected before antibiotic administration, along with the clinical presentation strongly suggests its involvement in the infection. However, it is also possible that an additional pathogen, undetected by culture, contributed to the infection and responded to the antibiotics administered. Ideally, 16S rRNA amplification and sequencing should have been performed on the original samples to confirm the absence of other contributing pathogens, which is a limitation of this study. Despite this, our report represents the first documented instance of <italic toggle=""yes"">P. endophytica</italic>  potentially causing infection in humans. <italic toggle=""yes"">M. goodii</italic> was the second uncommon organism isolated from our patient, contributing to the complexity of the infection. <italic toggle=""yes"">M. goodii</italic> is characterized as a rapid grower, acid-fast mycobacterium, forming smooth to mucoid, off-white to cream-colored colonies. These colonies may be nonpigmented or late pigmented [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR11"">11</xref>]. It is quite ubiquitous in the environment and can be found in soil, dust, and drinking water [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR5"">5</xref>, <xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR12"">12</xref>]. As a pathogen, <italic toggle=""yes"">M. goodii</italic> has been primarily associated with posttraumatic wound infections, particularly those following open fractures and associated osteomyelitis [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR11"">11</xref>, <xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR13"">13</xref>]. Additionally, reports indicate its involvement in infections associated with surgical implants over the past two decades [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR14"">14</xref>–<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR16"">16</xref>]. Our case adds to this body of evidence, representing another instance of <italic toggle=""yes"">M. goodii</italic> infection following traumatic injury with wound contamination, and subsequent implantation of a foreign body. <italic toggle=""yes"">M. goodii</italic> typically displays susceptibility to amikacin, ethambutol, and sulfamethoxazole [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR11"">11</xref>]. It exhibits intermediate susceptibility to ciprofloxacin, doxycycline, and tobramycin, with variable susceptibility to cefmetazole, cefoxitin, and clarithromycin. However, it is resistant to isoniazid and rifampin [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR11"">11</xref>]. This susceptibility profile is not consistent with empiric therapy with clarithromycin and rifampin, commonly used for other rapidly growing NTM. Given the potential for treatment failure associated with monotherapy regimens utilizing TMP/SMX or doxycycline [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR15"">15</xref>], a combination of TMP/SMX and doxycycline was administered to our patient to minimize the risk of recurrence or development of resistance. Notably, our patient has EDS, a group of inherited disorders that affect the connective tissues in the body, primarily the skin, joints, and blood vessel walls (<ext-link ext-link-type=""uri"" http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink href=""https://rarediseases.org/rare-diseases/ehlers-danlos-syndrome/"">https://rarediseases.org/rare-diseases/ehlers-danlos-syndrome/</ext-link>). EDS encompasses several subtypes, each linked to mutations in different genes involved in collagen or other connective tissue component production [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR17"">17</xref>]. However, the specific gene mutation underlying our patient’s condition is unknown. Nevertheless, individuals with EDS may present compromised immune function as demonstrated in our patient on his lower natural killer cell count or other underlying health conditions that could predispose them to infections [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR18"">18</xref>]. Therefore, it was not unexpected to encounter uncommon pathogens like <italic toggle=""yes"">M. goodii</italic> as the causative agent of severe necrosis and purulence at the surgical site. Additionally, it is plausible for a bacterium typically associated with plants to play a role in this patient’s infection. It is also worth mentioning that the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) recommends avoiding fluoroquinolone antibiotics if a patient has EDS because of an association of this class of medication with the occurrence of aneurysm. This individualized approach emphasizes the importance of considering the specific characteristics of <italic toggle=""yes"">M. goodii</italic> infections, the patient’s underlying conditions, and adapting treatment strategies accordingly. Given the patient’s immunodeficiency, careful consideration was given to its potential impact on treatment response and the risk of recurrent infections. Recognizing the influence of underlying health conditions, such as EDS, is essential in devising appropriate treatment strategies and managing complications effectively. Further investigation into the genetic basis of the patient’s EDS subtype may provide valuable insights into their susceptibility to infections and guide future treatment approaches if necessary. This case report underscores the identification of two infrequently encountered microbes, <italic toggle=""yes"">P. endophytica</italic> and <italic toggle=""yes"">M. goodii</italic>, as the potential culprits behind post-trauma hardware infection and abscess in a patient with EDS. Infections caused by <italic toggle=""yes"">M. goodii</italic>, although rare, can complicate traumatic orthopedic injuries, especially in patients with EDS and immune dysfunction. Successful management in this case required timely diagnosis, susceptibility-guided antibiotic therapy, and surgical intervention. The case emphasizes the importance of considering atypical pathogens in complex clinical scenarios and tailoring therapeutic strategies accordingly. Furthermore, the use of modern diagnostic tools facilitates the recognition of previously unrecognized pathogens, highlighting the potential emergence of new infectious organisms. This report contributes to our understanding of managing challenging infections and emphasizes the need for continued vigilance and research in infectious diseases.",N/A,27 9 2024

 Because the molecular genetic causes and the associated clinical signs in dogs with EDS are likely to be as diverse as they are in affected humans, it is probable that additional variants cause EDS in dogs. Going forward, DNA‐based subtyping of individual dogs may lead to improved clinical management and more accurate prognoses. Toward this end, we have been collecting clinical histories and genomic DNA from dogs with EDS‐like disorders. Here, we describe 6 likely causal <italic toggle=""yes"">COL5A1</italic> variants identified by whole‐genome sequencing, summarize the associated clinical histories, discuss potential disease mechanisms, and draw preliminary conclusions about the prognosis of classical EDS in dogs.   Ehlers‐Danlos syndromes are complex and heterogeneous connective tissue disorders as evidenced by 14 unique subtypes in human patients. The advent of a classification system that utilizes molecular genetics to facilitate categorizing EDS subtype allows for personalized medicine that has revolutionized patient care in individuals afflicted with this disorder. In an effort to bridge the gap in knowledge of EDS in dogs we described clinical histories, molecular genetics, ultrastructural findings in a group of 7 dogs with classical EDS. The disorders in these dogs were associated with 6 distinct <italic toggle=""yes"">COL5A1</italic> sequence variants that were absent from the whole‐genome sequences of 142 dogs with other diseases that served as controls. The most common clinical features in our cohort included multifocal wounds, atrophic scars, joint hypermobility, skin hyperextensibility, and chronic orthopedic abnormalities. Distinct differences in the ultrastructure of the dermal collagen fibrils were found in 3 affected dogs (Dogs 1, 5, and 6) with different <italic toggle=""yes"">COL5A1</italic> variants. In all 3 cases, the fibrils were much less tightly packed than those from the skin of an unaffected dog, but abnormalities in fibril size and shape differed between these dogs. The patterns of disease signs also were different among these dogs, as well as among the previously reported dogs with other <italic toggle=""yes"">COL5A1</italic> sequence variants (Table <xref rid=""jvim17180-supitem-0007"" ref-type=""supplementary-material"">S1</xref>).<xref rid=""jvim17180-bib-0033"" ref-type=""bibr"">

 The genomic sequence from Dog 6 contained an in‐frame deletion of a highly conserved glutamic acid in the C‐terminal propeptide region, which we predict disrupts the stability of the signal peptide and thus impairs its ability to direct trimeric alpha chain assembly. In humans, variants in the C‐terminal propeptide are causal for classical EDS because of decreased efficiency in incorporating pro alpha 1(V) chains into type V collagen trimers or impaired trafficking of the mutant protein through the endoplasmic reticulum.<xref rid=""jvim17180-bib-0041"" ref-type=""bibr"">

</xref> Therefore, it is reasonable to suspect that wounds in most dogs with classical EDS should heal without complication in a normal amount of time. Exceptions are expected based on variation in phenotype as well as severity and location of wounds. It is also important to note that most dogs in our study had ≥1 major surgical procedures and no delays or complications in healing directly related to the procedures were reported. Five of the 7 dogs in our series had clinically relevant orthopedic disease that may have been exacerbated by the presence of EDS. These orthopedic abnormalities included patellar luxation, joint luxation and subluxation, angular limb deformities, and suspected intervertebral disk herniation. Patellar luxation was a common orthopedic abnormality experienced by dogs in our report. The exact cause of patellar luxation in the dogs is unclear, but a multifactorial basis consisting of abnormal limb alignment, joint laxity, and genetic predisposition likely play key roles in the development of the disease.<xref rid=""jvim17180-bib-0051"" ref-type=""bibr"">
<sup>51</sup>
</xref> The presence of EDS could have predisposed these dogs to have markedly hypermobile joints leading to abnormal loading of the joints during growth and potentially exacerbating any existing limb malalignment or joint laxity. The clinical manifestations of these potentiating factors may predispose these dogs to more severe patella luxation, increased risk of joint trauma, or both. The long‐term clinical ramifications of EDS in dogs with concurrent orthopedic disease are yet to be determined, however, the role of EDS in causing increased risk of joint laxity and trauma could lead to secondary osteoarthritis as dogs get older. A large study of human patients with classical EDS found that muscoloskeletal abnormalities were frequent with sprains (45%), articular pain (40%), subdislocation (29%), walking difficulties (23%), and dislocation (21%) being most common.<xref rid=""jvim17180-bib-0003"" ref-type=""bibr"">

These results suggest that many dogs with classical EDS have the potential for long‐term survival with proper care.

 Our case series has a number of limitations. We were limited to clinical information reported in the medical records and communications with dog owners and attending veterinarians. Therefore, it is possible that some clinical features were missed with a possible bias toward the most pronounced signs identified on examination or noticed by the dog owner. A uniform systematic approach to diagnostic evaluation is needed to establish a comprehensive genotype‐phenotype correlation in dogs with classical EDS. In addition to documentation of dermal signs, this evaluation should include but not be limited to an extensive orthopedic examination with musculoskeletal radiographic imaging, echocardiography, ophthalmic examination, and retrieval of skin biopsy samples for ultrastructural examination. The skin extensibility index is a diagnostic tool that can guide clinical suspicion for EDS. Skin extensibility index measurements were not included because they were not recorded by most of the attending clinicians at the time the dogs were originally diagnosed and measures obtained later in life may have been misleading given the progression in skin redundancy. Other than the 2 half‐siblings that had the same disease‐associated variant, each of the <italic toggle=""yes"">COL5A1</italic> variants was unique. This finding indicates that variants in this gene occur relatively frequently. None of the parents of the 2 dogs with the same variant exhibited clinical signs related to EDS and the dam was homozygous for the reference allele. Thus, although we were not able to obtain DNA samples from the sires, it seems unlikely that they both harbored the same <italic toggle=""yes"">COL5A1</italic> dominant disease variant present in the affected offspring. It is more likely that the variant arose from a variant in the germline of the mother.<xref rid=""jvim17180-bib-0052"" ref-type=""bibr"">
<sup>52</sup>
</xref> Because we did not have access to close relatives of the other dogs, it is not possible to know whether the causal variants were new or occurred in prior generations. Because of the diversity of disease‐associated variants, genetic testing in most suspected cases would have to involve sequencing of the entire <italic toggle=""yes"">COL5A1</italic> gene. Our case series has expanded the genotypic and phenotypic spectrum of the classical subtype of EDS by identifying 6 novel <italic toggle=""yes"">COL5A1</italic> variants in conjunction with detailed clinical histories that contained long‐term follow‐up information in 7 dogs. Our study illustrates the potential utility of classifying the EDS subtype based on the gene containing the likely causal variant.

Cerebral air embolism associated with cavitary lung lesion in a patient with Ehlers-Danlos syndrome,"Pneumocephalus, is a general term describing the presence of air within the intracranial structures. It most commonly occurs due to dural injury, often the sequela of head trauma or surgery. More infrequently, nontraumatic pneumocephalus can be related to infection, Valsalva, fistulization between air-containing organs and intracranial structures, or vascular air embolism. While postsurgical pneumocephalus is often benign, serious consequences of pneumocephalus exist, including tension pneumocephalus and cerebral infarction. We present a case of air embolism and cerebral infarction in a patient with Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, found to have large cavitary lesion in the left upper lobe of the lung, with associated pulmonary vascular malformation seen on bronchoscopy. To our knowledge this is the first reported case of air embolism associated with a pulmonary cavitary lesion and vascular malformation, in a patient with Ehlers-Danlos syndrome.","Intracranial air, also known as pneumocephalus [<xref rid=""bib0002"" ref-type=""bibr"">2</xref>], generally occurs as a result of injury to the dura, often following head trauma, diagnostic procedures, or surgery [<xref rid=""bib0004"" ref-type=""bibr"">4</xref>], and less frequently in the setting of Valsalva and changes in atmospheric pressure. Air embolism is a rare cause of pneumocephalus, with high morbidity, often complicated by cerebral infarction [<xref rid=""bib0003"" ref-type=""bibr"">3</xref>]. As with other etiologies of pneumocephalus, air embolism usually occurs following trauma, surgery, or diagnostic procedures; however, it can result from any cause of air entry into the systemic vasculature. We present the first reported case of air embolism and cerebral infarction in a patient with Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, found to have large cavitary lesion in the left upper lobe of the lung. Patient is a 22-year-old male with autism and Ehlers Danlos syndrome, who was brought to the emergency room by his mother after she found him rigid, shaking, and unresponsive. Patient had been watching television in his room prior to when his mother found him. Upon arrival at the ER, patient had a National Institute of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) score of 28, with pinpoint pupils and intact brainstem reflexes. Patient did not respond to Narcan administration. A stroke code was called, and noncontrast enhanced CT of the head demonstrated extensive bilateral air emboli (<xref rid=""fig0001"" ref-type=""fig"">Figure 1</xref>). CT angiography (CTA) of the head and neck with intravenous (IV) contrast showed a cavitary lesion in the left lung apex containing an air-blood level, and surrounding ground glass opacities, measuring approximately 2.8 × 2.3 cm (<xref rid=""fig0003"" ref-type=""fig"">Figure 3</xref>). Subsequent noncontrast enhanced brain MRI showed diffuse bilateral infarction (<xref rid=""fig0002"" ref-type=""fig"">Figure 2</xref>). Once stabilized, bronchoscopy was performed which identified a pulmonary vascular malformation at the site of lung cavitation, thought to be a possible source of the air embolism. CTA of the chest with IV contrast did not identify a corresponding pulmonary arteriovenous malformation, but did demonstrate significant ectasia of the main pulmonary artery, measuring 5.0 cm in diameter (<xref rid=""fig0004"" ref-type=""fig"">Figure 4</xref>).

Patient was eventually discharged to long term acute care hospital for ventilator weaning. Pneumocephalus is a general term describing the presence of air within the intracranial spaces [<xref rid=""bib0002"" ref-type=""bibr"">2</xref>]. It occurs primarily following injury to the dura. Common causes include head trauma, surgery, and certain diagnostic procedures [<xref rid=""bib0004"" ref-type=""bibr"">4</xref>]. Less commonly, nontraumatic pneumocephalus can occur due to infection by gas-forming organisms, and increases in intracranial pressure secondary to variations in atmospheric pressure and Valsalva. In more rare cases, pneumocephalus is related to fistulization between air-containing organs and intracranial structures [<xref rid=""bib0002"" ref-type=""bibr"">2</xref>] or from vascular air embolism. In certain cases, such as after surgery, pneumocephalus may be asymptomatic; however, serious complications can occur, including tension pneumocephalus [<xref rid=""bib0005"" ref-type=""bibr"">5</xref>], and in the case of air embolism, cerebral infarction. Our case is of particular interest as it represents an example of air embolism associated with a pulmonary cavitary lesion and vascular malformation in a patient with Ehlers-Danlos syndrome. While cerebral infarction due to air embolism has been reported in a patient with a lung cavitary lesion in the setting of pulmonary tuberculosis [<xref rid=""bib0010"" ref-type=""bibr"">10</xref>], in our case, an extensive work-up did not find any evidence of tuberculosis or other infectious cause for pulmonary cavitation. To our knowledge, this is the first reported case of air embolization in the context of cavitary lesion in Ehlers-Danlos syndrome. Ehlers-Danlos is a spectrum of heritable connective tissue syndromes, related to each other by presence of defects in the genes involved in structure and synthesis of collagen proteins [<xref rid=""bib0006"" ref-type=""bibr"">6</xref>]. Hallmark symptoms include tissue fragility, joint hypermobility, and skin hyperextensibility. The manifestations of Ehlers-Danlos syndrome can be quite variable given the ubiquity of collagen in the human body [<xref rid=""bib0006"" ref-type=""bibr"">6</xref>]. Vascular Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome (vEDS) is an umbrella term which describes subtypes of EDS typified by vascular fragility, whose patients are predisposed to vascular events, including dissection and aneurysm formation [<xref rid=""bib0007"" ref-type=""bibr"">7</xref>]. Presence of significant pulmonary arterial ectasia in our patient is most consistent with vEDS. Different pulmonary pathologies and lesions have also been reported in patients with vEDS, including formation of cavitary nodules [<xref rid=""bib0008"" ref-type=""bibr"">8</xref>]. These are thought to develop as a sequela of spontaneous pulmonary hemorrhage and hematoma formation [<xref rid=""bib0009"" ref-type=""bibr"">9</xref>]. In our case, the overlap of the pulmonary and vascular syndromic manifestations of vEDS are likely to have led to the formation of the cavitary lesion in the patient's left lung apex, resulting in pulmonary vascular injury and the development of the vascular malformation seen on bronchoscopy. While corresponding arteriovenous malformation was not identified on CTA of the chest with IV contrast, a number of possibilities may explain this, including: 1) presence of broncho-venous fistula, 2) arteriovenous component in the vascular malformation below the resolution of CTA, 3) transient broncho-arterial fistulization within the vascular malformation, 4) migration of air into the pulmonary capillary bed facilitated by damage to the wall of the cavitary lesion [<xref rid=""bib0010"" ref-type=""bibr"">10</xref>], without component of arteriovenous or bronchoarterial fistulization. Although beyond the scope of this case report, it would be interesting to further determine if pulmonary cavitation associated with EDS is a significant risk factor for air embolism, and if stratification of risk based on EDS status can improve patient outcomes. Cerebral infarction is a devastating complication of air embolism. We present a case of air embolization associated with lung cavitation in the setting of Ehlers-Danlos syndrome. To our knowledge, this is the first reported such case. Consent for publication of the case was obtained from the patient.",N/A,06 9 2024
Musculocontractural Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome Leading to Hemorrhagic Shock From Giant Subcutaneous Hematoma: A Case Report,"The patient was a six-year-old boy with a history of musculocontractural Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (mcEDS). He presented to the emergency department after falling on the road the day before admission, which led to an increase in subcutaneous hematoma in his left lower leg and brief syncope. Initial blood tests revealed a decreased hemoglobin level of 8.1 g/dL (normal range: 14 g/dL). Contrast-enhanced CT showed a massive subcutaneous and intermuscular hematoma in the left thigh. He was diagnosed with hemorrhagic shock due to this extensive hemorrhage and was admitted to the ICU. The affected area was elevated, and hemostasis was achieved through compression. The swelling gradually improved, and he was discharged from the hospital on day 13 after admission. EDS is a systemic condition caused by genetic mutations affecting collagen and collagen-modifying enzymes. mcEDS is an extremely rare variant with a recently identified causative gene, characterized by abnormal connective tissue development and progressive fragility. Giant subcutaneous hematomas resulting from tissue fragility are serious complications of this disease, often occurring with minor trauma and sometimes leading to gradual hemorrhagic shock. Desmopressin nasal drops can be effective in preventing such hematomas. It is crucial to consider the risk of hemorrhagic shock from subcutaneous hemorrhage in patients with mcEDS, especially when repeated subcutaneous hematomas of unknown origin are observed.","Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (EDS) is a systemic disorder resulting from genetic mutations in collagen and collagen-modifying enzymes, with varying clinical presentations depending on the subtype. It has an overall prevalence of 1 in 5,000 individuals [<xref rid=""REF1"" ref-type=""bibr"">1</xref>]. Musculocontractural EDS (mcEDS) is an extremely rare form, with the causative genes recently identified as carbohydrate sulfotransferase 14 (CHST14) or dermatan sulfate epimerase (DSE).

Giant subcutaneous hematomas resulting from tissue fragility are among the most severe complications of mcEDS [<xref rid=""REF3"" ref-type=""bibr"">3</xref>]. We present a case of a patient with mcEDS who developed hemorrhagic shock due to a massive hematoma following minor trauma. The patient was a six-year-old boy with a history of mcEDS caused by CHST14. Born with multiple joint contractures, he was diagnosed with mcEDS by genetic testing at the age of 3. After falling on the road and bruising his left thigh, swelling and pain in the left thigh gradually worsened. The day following the injury, he was found pale and unconscious for several seconds and was taken to the emergency room. At the time of consultation, his consciousness was clear, his heart rate was 160 beats/min, his blood pressure was 131/77 mmHg, and internal hemorrhage with marked swelling of the left thigh was observed (Figure <xref rid=""FIG1"" ref-type=""fig"">1</xref>). Blood tests showed decreased hemoglobin at 8.1 g/dL (normal: 14 g/dL), but coagulation function values were normal and bleeding time was within the normal range. Contrast-enhanced CT revealed no obvious arterial bleeding but showed a massive subcutaneous and intermuscular hematoma in the left thigh (Figure <xref rid=""FIG2"" ref-type=""fig"">2</xref>). There was no significant hemorrhage at other sites. Hemorrhagic shock from subcutaneous massive hemorrhage was diagnosed, and the patient was admitted to the intensive care unit. Tachycardia improved with crystalloid solution administration. Hemoglobin dropped to 6.9 g/dL over time, and tranexamic acid was administered to halt bleeding progression. The affected area was elevated, and hemostasis was achieved by compression. During management, careful observation was made to ensure that compression did not cause additional hemorrhage or disrupt tissue perfusion in the lower leg. The swelling gradually improved, and he was discharged from the hospital on day 13 after admission. mcEDS is an exceedingly rare subtype of EDS, with a prevalence of approximately 1 in 1 million. Recent advances have identified the causative genes for mcEDS as CHST14 or DSE. This condition is marked by abnormal development, such as distinctive facial features and congenital joint contractures, and progressive connective tissue fragility, which can manifest as skin hyperextension, systemic joint relaxation, chronic dislocations, and giant subcutaneous hematomas [<xref rid=""REF2"" ref-type=""bibr"">2</xref>]. mcEDS-CHST14 tends to present more frequently with symptom crises compared to mcEDS-DSE [<xref rid=""REF4"" ref-type=""bibr"">4</xref>]. The fragility observed in connective tissues is attributed to collagen fibril assembly failures linked to systemic deficiencies in dermatan sulfate [<xref rid=""REF3"" ref-type=""bibr"">3</xref>]. Early diagnosis of mcEDS should be considered in patients exhibiting these symptoms, with genetic testing being crucial for confirmation. Giant subcutaneous hematoma, a severe complication of this disease, can arise from minor trauma and may progress gradually to cause hemorrhagic shock [<xref rid=""REF5"" ref-type=""bibr"">5</xref>]. Studies indicate that 80% of patients with large subcutaneous hematomas experience their first episode by the age of 12 [<xref rid=""REF6"" ref-type=""bibr"">6</xref>]. The prognosis for mcEDS remains uncertain due to the limited number of cases. Currently, no curative treatment exists for mcEDS. However, preventive measures can be employed for all EDS forms. Desmopressin nasal drops have proven effective in preventing subcutaneous hematomas [<xref rid=""REF7"" ref-type=""bibr"">7</xref>]. Previous reports have shown that DDAVP treatment following trauma can avert the development of large hematomas in mcEDS patients [<xref rid=""REF3"" ref-type=""bibr"">3</xref>]. Desmopressin is believed to improve platelet-collagen interactions impaired by EDS and enhance von Willebrand factor-mediated platelet adhesion [<xref rid=""REF8"" ref-type=""bibr"">8</xref>]. Additionally, tranexamic acid may help halt bleeding progression and can be administered in primary care settings [<xref rid=""REF9"" ref-type=""bibr"">9</xref>]. In the present case, hemostasis was delayed due to the spread of venous hemorrhage within the fragile subcutaneous tissue and muscle, triggered by a minor contusion. This led to hemorrhagic shock. It is crucial to be aware of the risk of hemorrhagic shock from subcutaneous hemorrhage in patients with mcEDS. Repeated subcutaneous hematomas of unknown origin should prompt suspicion of this disease. Early genetic testing and diagnosis are essential for timely preventive measures, which can significantly improve the prognosis for patients with mcEDS.",N/A,13 8 2024
An overview of Ehlers Danlos syndrome and the link between postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome and gastrointestinal symptoms with a focus on gastroparesis,"There has been an increasingly reported association between Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (EDS), postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome (POTS) and gastrointestinal disorders. EDS is a hereditary connective tissue disorder which may manifest as a spectrum of symptoms stemming from collagen defects. The prevalence of EDS is estimated to affect 1 in 5000 individuals which underscores its clinical significance. Notably the hypermobile form (hEDS) accounts for the majority of cases. POTS is characterized by orthostatic intolerance with an increase in heart rate on standing in the absence of hypotension. This condition predominantly affects women between 15 and 45 years of age. Gastrointestinal symptoms in the form of reflux, bloating and abdominal pain significant impact this population. Gastroparesis is a chronic disorder involving symptoms of delayed gastric emptying and may be closely associated with hEDS and POTS, and may be underreported. Autonomic dysfunction associated with hEDS has been proposed as the likely mechanism underlying POTS and gastrointestinal dysfunction though a clear pathophysiological process has not been established.","Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (EDS) constitutes a collection of hereditary and heterogenous connective tissue disorders impacting the skin, ligaments, joints, blood vessels and internal organs (<xref rid=""ref1"" ref-type=""bibr"">1</xref>).

Gastroparesis in EDS is less well defined within the spectrum of associated gastrointestinal symptoms. Postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome (POTS) is a heterogeneous condition which is characterized by an increase in heart rate of >/= 30 bpm that occurs within 10 min of standing. There is an absence of orthostatic hypotension that is defined as a decrease in systolic blood pressure > 20 mmHg or diastolic blood pressure > 10 mmHg (<xref rid=""ref8"" ref-type=""bibr"">8</xref>). It is more common in women compared with men with a ratio of at least 4.5:1 and a range between15-45 years of age (<xref rid=""ref8"" ref-type=""bibr"">8</xref>, <xref rid=""ref9"" ref-type=""bibr"">9</xref>). POTS is characterized by symptoms of light-headedness, mental fogging, blurred vision, dyspnoea and palpitations (<xref rid=""ref8"" ref-type=""bibr"">8</xref>). Incumbering gastrointestinal symptoms such as reflux, nausea, bloating, abdominal pain and altered bowel habits are the most prominent non-cardiovascular complaints among this population (<xref rid=""ref10"" ref-type=""bibr"">10</xref>). Gastroparesis is a chronic disorder that is characterized by symptoms of delayed gastric emptying in the absence of mechanical obstruction (<xref rid=""ref11"" ref-type=""bibr"">11</xref>). While a diagnosis is often accompanied by functional investigations such as gastric emptying studies, these tests are imperfect due to patient variables and a lack of standardized cut-offs. Additionally, it can be difficult to differentiate gastroparesis from functional dyspepsia based on clinical features (<xref rid=""ref12"" ref-type=""bibr"">12</xref>). There may be a higher than previously reported incidence of gastroparesis in patients with EDS and POTS. There is an increased prevalence of autonomic dysfunction in patients with EDS with reportedly up to 40% having some disorder of orthostatic intolerance such as POTS (<xref rid=""ref8"" ref-type=""bibr"">8</xref>). Conversely up to 18% of patients with POTS have been found to have EDS (<xref rid=""ref13"" ref-type=""bibr"">13</xref>). Patients with both conditions appear to also have increased symptom burden (<xref rid=""ref14"" ref-type=""bibr"">14</xref>, <xref rid=""ref15"" ref-type=""bibr"">15</xref>). The underlying mechanism remains unclear though there are hypotheses underscoring the pathophysiology based off structural and functional abnormalities. This review article aims to highlight the association between EDS, POTS and functional gut disorders with a focus on gastroparesis. Increased awareness and recognition of associated symptoms may lead to more timely and accurate diagnoses which in turn reduces delays in management leading to overall improved patient care.     In conclusion, this review provides an overview of hEDS, POTS, and the gastrointestinal issues commonly associated with both conditions, particularly gastroparesis. While there is a notable overlap between these conditions, no definitive pathophysiological mechanism has been identified to link them, and the underlying mechanisms for each condition remain uncertain. The etiology of hEDS remains unclear, with no specific genetic mutation yet established. The heterogeneous presentation of hEDS, with overlapping signs and symptoms across different conditions, underscores the need for further research to establish a molecular diagnosis, which could help reduce delays in patient management. Diagnosing POTS is also challenged by the absence of universally accepted diagnostic criteria, likely contributing to both delayed and potentially inappropriate diagnoses. There may be an increased prevalence of gastroparesis in hEDS and POTS populations, suggesting that future studies could incorporate gastric emptying assessments to differentiate gastroparesis from other functional gastrointestinal disorders. However, it is crucial to acknowledge the limitations inherent in current study designs, such as the heterogeneity of data sources, limited longitudinal data, potential publication bias, and the underrepresentation of diverse populations. These limitations may impact the findings, and addressing them in future research would provide a more balanced and comprehensive understanding of these conditions and their interrelationships.",N/A,29 8 2024
Modulating the extracellular matrix to treat wound healing defects in Ehlers-Danlos syndrome,"Classic Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (cEDS) is a genetic disorder of the connective tissue that is characterized by mutations in genes coding type V collagen. Wound healing defects are characteristic of cEDS and no therapeutic strategies exist. Herein we describe a murine model of cEDS that phenocopies wound healing defects seen in humans. Our model features mice with conditional loss of <italic toggle=""yes"">Col5a1</italic> in <italic toggle=""yes"">Col1a2</italic><sup>+</sup> fibroblasts (Col5a1CKO). This model shows that an abnormal extracellular matrix (ECM) characterized by fibrillar disarray, altered mechanical properties, and decreased collagen deposition contribute to the wound healing defect. The cEDS animals exhibit decreased expression of epidermal genes and increased inflammation. Finally, we demonstrate that inhibiting mechanosensitive integrin signaling or by injecting wild-type (WT) fibroblasts into cEDS animals enhances epidermal gene expression, decreases inflammation, and augments wound closure. These findings suggest that cell delivery and/or blocking integrin signaling are potentially therapeutic strategies to rescue wound healing defects in cEDS.  <list list-type=""simple"" id=""ulist0010""><list-item id=""u0010""><label>•</label><p id=""p0010"">Deletion of <italic toggle=""yes"">Col5a1</italic> in fibroblasts impairs wound healing by disrupting ECM formation</p></list-item><list-item id=""u0015""><label>•</label><p id=""p0015"">Col5a1<sup>−/−</sup> wounds show elevated inflammation and enhanced integrin expression</p></list-item><list-item id=""u0020""><label>•</label><p id=""p0020"">High integrin expression can be targeted by cilengitide to improve wound healing</p></list-item><list-item id=""u0025""><label>•</label><p id=""p0025"">Wound healing defects can also be rescued by cell delivery of wild-type fibroblasts</p></list-item></list> Medicine; Cell biology","Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (EDS) comprises a group of genetic disorders of the connective tissue and musculoskeletal system affecting 1/5,000–1/25,000 individuals.<xref rid=""bib1"" ref-type=""bibr""><sup>1</sup></xref> Classical EDS (cEDS) is one of the most common (1/10,000–1/20,000) and well-described forms of EDS caused by mutations in <italic toggle=""yes"">Col5a1</italic> or <italic toggle=""yes"">Col5a2</italic> genes, and most individuals have decreased type V collagen in tissues.<xref rid=""bib1"" ref-type=""bibr""><sup>1</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid=""bib2"" ref-type=""bibr""><sup>2</sup></xref> Type V collagen is classified as a fibril-forming collagen and functions to arrange type I and type III collagen fibrils in a lattice-like framework in the extracellular matrix (ECM) and is required for the proper architecture of the ECM in the skin and other tissue.<xref rid=""bib3"" ref-type=""bibr""><sup>3</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid=""bib4"" ref-type=""bibr""><sup>4</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid=""bib5"" ref-type=""bibr""><sup>5</sup></xref> For instance, in the complete absence of ColV, mesenchyme is unable to form with early death of the embryo. ColV is also known to play an important role in arranging the fibrillar pattern of the ECM after tissue injury, and deficiency of ColV after corneal wounding results in loss of optical transparency of the cornea. The functional role of ColV in maintaining the normal architecture of the matrix and other tissue contributes to the characteristic phenotype observed in individuals with cEDS who are typically haploinsufficient. Phenotypically, cEDS is characterized by skin hyperextensibility, joint hypermobility, fragile skin, easy bruising, and delayed wound healing with formation of atrophic scars.<xref rid=""bib6"" ref-type=""bibr""><sup>6</sup></xref> Individuals with cEDS demonstrate a profound defect in wound healing, and defects in wound healing are so common that impaired wound healing is considered to be a major criterion for the diagnosis of cEDS.<xref rid=""bib6"" ref-type=""bibr""><sup>6</sup></xref> The lack of a normal ECM architecture after skin wounding in cEDS results in failure of epithelial regeneration in individuals with cEDS and this results in the formation of broad scars.

Skin fibroblasts after skin wounding express a variety of collagens including ColV, and whether the secretion of ECM proteins deficient in ColV after skin wounding contributes to wound healing defects or whether the abnormal matrix present prior to wounding in ColV-deficient animals predominantly contributes to wound healing defects is not clear. Currently, there are no therapeutic targets or strategies to treat the wound healing defects in cEDS. Determining the role of fibroblasts and their secretion of ColV-deficient matrix in wound healing defects in cEDS could help in identifying new targets that could be administered after wounding to attenuate wound healing defects.<xref rid=""bib9"" ref-type=""bibr""><sup>9</sup></xref> Animal models of cEDS have been described that use a haploinsufficient Col5a1<sup>+/−</sup> mouse that displays delayed wound healing compared to Col5a1<sup>+/+</sup> mice in a small, unsplinted wounding model. In this model, <italic toggle=""yes"">Col5a1</italic> abnormalities of the matrix are present from birth making it difficult to ascertain the active and direct role of <italic toggle=""yes"">Col5a1</italic> in wound healing.<xref rid=""bib10"" ref-type=""bibr""><sup>10</sup></xref> While these cultured haploinsufficient fibroblasts displayed decreased proliferation and migration <italic toggle=""yes"">in vitro</italic>,<xref rid=""bib10"" ref-type=""bibr""><sup>10</sup></xref> it would not be possible to tease out the role of acute production of type V collagen versus preexisting matrix dysfunction using this model. To more directly address the question of the role of ColV secretion after skin wounding in contributing to defective wound healing, we created a murine model of cEDS, where the role of <italic toggle=""yes"">Col5a1</italic> in wound healing can be more directly ascertained. In this model, we conditionally deleted Col5a1 in Col1a2-expressing fibroblasts at the time of skin wounding to directly ascertain the role of ColV secretion at the time of wounding, in contributing to cEDS wound healing defects.<xref rid=""bib11"" ref-type=""bibr""><sup>11</sup></xref> This was done by crossing Col1a2CreERT animals with animals that had both Col5a1 alleles floxed. As the Cre-mediated deletion of Col5a1 is regulated by a tamoxifen inducible cassette, this enables us to precisely determine the role of ColV at the time of skin wounding. We show that acute loss of <italic toggle=""yes"">Col5a1</italic> in fibroblasts at the time of skin wounding is sufficient to phenocopy wound healing defects in individuals with cEDS with delayed re-epithelialization, poor ECM organization, and enhanced and prolonged inflammation. These defects are associated with differential expression of integrins in Col5a1CKO wounds that also have been observed in individuals with cEDS. Using this model, we identify abnormalities of wound mechanics, inflammation, and dysregulated gene expression that underlies defects in cEDS. We demonstrate that rescue of ECM at the time of wounding with fibroblast transplantation or small molecules is sufficient to rescue the phenotype of defective wound healing in cEDS. Our observations have potential ramifications for designing therapeutic strategies for wound healing defects in cEDS.  Defective wound healing is one of the most common and debilitating symptoms in cEDS but no effective treatments yet exist for augmenting wound healing in this condition. We demonstrate that the Col5a1CKO animal remarkably phenocopies human wound healing defects in cEDS. A previously described haploinsufficient model had also demonstrated wound healing defects but in that instance as <italic toggle=""yes"">Col5a1</italic> had been deleted <italic toggle=""yes"">in utero</italic>, it was difficult to exclude secondary compensatory changes that could have affected wound healing. The Col5a1CKO model described by us thus can directly examine the role of type V collagen in wound healing as deletion of <italic toggle=""yes"">Col5a1</italic> occurs at the time of wounding. We observed that skin wounds demonstrated delayed closure and exhibited decreased mechanical strength and broad scarring. Such a phenotype of defective wound healing is commonly observed in humans with cEDS, thus making the model suitable for investigating the biology of wound healing defects in cEDS. Our data suggest that abnormalities of the matrix with collagen fibrillar disarray, altered mechanical, properties and decreased collagen deposition contribute to wound healing defects in cEDS. Regrowth of the epidermis at the edges of the wound is critical for effective wound closure but the Col5a1CKO animal demonstrated significant downregulation of epidermal growth or development, along with a persistent inflammatory infiltrate. Persistence of inflammation can be commonly observed in individuals with cEDS, often secondary to poor healing or recurrent trauma.<xref rid=""bib1"" ref-type=""bibr""><sup>1</sup></xref> Transcriptomic analysis of wounds of Col5a1CKO animals demonstrated decreased expression of ECM genes and biochemical measurements confirmed decreased collagen deposition. These observations are consistent with recent studies of skin fibroblasts from patients with cEDS that showed decreased expression of canonical genes of fibroblast activation.<xref rid=""bib9"" ref-type=""bibr""><sup>9</sup></xref> Using this murine model that recapitulates wound healing defects in human cEDS, we demonstrate that mechanical properties of the wound are abnormal, with wounds lacking mechanical strength. We show here that the wounds of Col5a1CKO animals are enriched in <bold><italic toggle=""yes"">α</italic></bold>v<bold><italic toggle=""yes"">β</italic></bold>3 expression and those findings are also consistent with human data demonstrating abundant expression of various integrins and specifically <bold>α</bold>v<bold>β</bold>3 in myofibroblasts in skin of humans with cEDS.<xref rid=""bib15"" ref-type=""bibr""><sup>15</sup></xref> In a model of cardiac injury, we have previously demonstrated that cilengitide, which is known to inhibit <bold><italic toggle=""yes"">α</italic></bold>v<bold><italic toggle=""yes"">β</italic></bold>3 signaling, can partially rescue aberrant mechanosensitive integrin signaling and lead to enhanced wound healing in type V collagen-deficient animals.<xref rid=""bib11"" ref-type=""bibr""><sup>11</sup></xref> Consistent with those observations, we demonstrate that the small molecule cilengitide can also partially rescue skin wound healing defects in the Col5a1CKO animal. As the matrix appears to the primary abnormality contributing to defective wound healing in cEDS, we demonstrate that cellular therapy by injection of WT skin fibroblasts into skin wounds of Col5a1CKO animals or the treatment of Col5a1CKO animals with cilengitide can significantly enhance wound healing and reverse adverse changes in gene expression affecting epidermal and inflammatory genes. Wounds of treated Col5a1CKO animals (with either WT fibroblasts or cilengitide) demonstrated rescue of expression of epidermal genes regulating epidermal repair as well as decreased expression of pro-inflammatory genes. The wounds exhibited significantly greater amount of collagen deposition and overall the closure of the wounds was enhanced within 14 days of injury. Both the inflammatory response and epidermis development pathway could be potential targets for improving wound healing. Taken together, these observations demonstrate a murine model of cEDS and provide insight into modulation of integrin-based mechanosensitive signaling as well as cellular injection of fibroblasts that could serve as potential therapeutic strategies for enhancing wound healing in cEDS.

Cesarean Delivery in a Patient With Hypermobile Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome: A Case Report,"Patients with hypermobile Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (hEDS) usually present with generalized joint hypermobility and pain, soft and hyperextensible skin with atrophic scars and easy bruising, periodontitis, mitral valve prolapse, and aortic root dilation. It may also lead to cervical spine instability or collapse of larynx cartilage/trachea, which can result in intubation difficulties and possible mucosal damage. Lung protective ventilation must be performed to prevent pneumothorax. Bruising, scoliosis, spondylosis, meningeal Tarlov cysts, increased risk for postdural puncture headache (PDPH), and resistance to local anesthetics may affect neuraxial anesthesia. This article aims to report an anesthetic approach of a 24-year-old woman with hEDS proposed for cesarean delivery. Additional past medical history included cutaneous psoriasis, polycystic ovarian syndrome, and bilateral hip dysplasia. No previous allergies were reported. She has been previously submitted to an uneventful general anesthesia. After rapid-sequence induction of general anesthesia, endotracheal intubation was performed with videolaryngoscopy. Balanced anesthesia with volatile anesthetics was used. The birth and recovery were safely managed without adverse events. hEDS can present challenges for both neuraxial anesthesia and orotracheal intubation. In this case, the initial anesthetic plan included general anesthesia and an airway approach with a videolaryngoscope. Patient positioning and padding were carefully executed to prevent bruising and joint dislocations.","Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (EDS) has a frequency of one in 5000 [<xref rid=""REF1"" ref-type=""bibr"">1</xref>], with hypermobile EDS (hEDS) accounting for 90% of reported cases (classified as a rare disorder) [<xref rid=""REF2"" ref-type=""bibr"">2</xref>]. Symptoms usually present in childhood to early adolescence, often resulting in generalized joint hypermobility associated with pain, soft and hyperextensible skin with atrophic scars and easy bruising, periodontitis, abdominal hernias, pelvic organ prolapse, marfanoid body habitus, mitral valve prolapse, and aortic root dilatation (typically of a mild degree with no increased risk of cardiac complications) [<xref rid=""REF3"" ref-type=""bibr"">3</xref>]. Other common features include chronic fatigue, functional bowel disorders, dysautonomia, swallowing and phonation disorders, gastroesophageal reflux, obstructive sleep apnea, migraine, peripheral neuropathies, mast cell activation disorders, anxiety disorders, urogynecologic disorders, and bleeding complications [<xref rid=""REF1"" ref-type=""bibr"">1</xref>]. The gastrointestinal tract, gravid uterus, and, less commonly, lungs, spleen, and liver are prone to spontaneous rupture [<xref rid=""REF4"" ref-type=""bibr"">4</xref>]. Perioperative management in patients with hEDS includes assessment of patient history, namely, the specific subtype, bleeding anamnesis, EDS complications, and airway difficulties. Efforts should be made to avoid tourniquets (risk of hematoma and compartment syndrome), perform adequate patient positioning with padding (reduction of shear forces and external tissue pressure), and ensure early mobilization. In the case of positive bleeding history, desmopressin might be used and crossmatching adequate amounts of red blood cells (RBCs) must be performed. Non-invasive monitoring should be performed, keeping in mind the risk of hematoma formation by repetitive non-invasive blood pressure measurements. Postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome is common in patients with hEDS and preoperative infusion of crystalloid and early use of vasopressors might be helpful. Regarding airway management, care is required with mask ventilation to avoid temporomandibular joint luxation. Repeated intubation attempts can lead to bleeding and cuff pressure should be monitored closely and kept as low as possible to minimize mucosal damage, preferably using smaller endotracheal tubes. Airway pressure should be minimized due to the risk of pneumothorax. Patients with temporomandibular dysfunction, premature spondylosis, or occipitoatlantoaxial instability have an increased risk of difficult airway management. General anesthesia can be performed as balanced anesthesia with volatile anesthetics, nitrous oxide, or as total intravenous anesthesia (TIVA). Neuromuscular relaxants are safe and monitoring of neuromuscular blockade is advised before emergence from the anesthesia. Regarding regional anesthesia, a greater rate of postdural puncture headache (PDPH) after neuraxial blockade might be expected, due to tissue fragility. Difficulties in the technique might be encountered in the presence of spinal pathology (scoliosis, kyphosis, spinal stenosis, etc.). Isolated or multiple Tarlov cysts (cerebrospinal-fluid filled perineurial cysts) as a sign of meningeal involvement is a feature of hEDS, most of which are located in the S1 to S4 region of the spinal cord. Pre-interventional ultrasound imaging (or use of MRI) might help to rule out relevant spine pathology. In addition, local anesthetic resistance has been reported [<xref rid=""REF5"" ref-type=""bibr"">5</xref>,<xref rid=""REF6"" ref-type=""bibr"">6</xref>]. There is no general recommendation for the mode of delivery in specific EDS types [<xref rid=""REF4"" ref-type=""bibr"">4</xref>]. Neuraxial regional anesthesia should be avoided in vascular EDS. Using patient-controlled IV remifentanil for vaginal delivery might be a pragmatic approach in patients with a high risk for neuraxial complications. A 24-year-old woman, ASA 2, presented for cesarean delivery due to a breech presentation. Past medical history included hEDS, cutaneous psoriasis, polycystic ovarian syndrome, and bilateral hip dysplasia. Symptoms of hEDS included joint hypermobility and pain, scoliosis, and striae. She was medicated with oral supplements (folic acid, vitamin B12, vitamin B6, vitamin D, omega 3, and essential minerals, like iron, magnesium, iodine, and ginger). No previous allergies were reported. She has been previously submitted to an uneventful general anesthesia for rhinoplasty. The preoperative analytical study revealed a hemoglobin of 11.9 g/dl, a platelet count of 306,000/mm<sup>2</sup>, and a coagulation study without changes. Typing and crossmatching of two RBC units was performed. After entering the operating room, the patient was monitored according to the ASA standard. Vital signs were as follows: blood pressure of 123/87 mmHg, heart rate of 99 beats per minute (bpm) with normal sinus rhythm, and peripheral oxygen saturation (SpO<sub>2</sub>) of 96% in room air. Anesthetic depth was monitored with BIS® and neuromuscular blockade with TOF®. Fluid therapy with Ringer's lactate and active warming maneuvers with a thermal air blanket was started. Pre-oxygenation was initiated with a face mask and a rapid sequence induction of general anesthesia was carried out, using 200 mg of propofol and 100 mg of rocuronium. Orotracheal intubation was performed with the McGrath videolaryngoscope, and a simple 7.0 orotracheal tube was introduced. Cuff pressure was checked and general anesthesia was maintained using a mixture of air, oxygen, nitrous oxide, and sevoflurane. Invasive blood pressure monitoring was started and a bladder catheter was introduced. The patient was mobilized with great caution and the pressure areas were protected with padding. After birth, we administered 100 mcg of fentanyl.  We opted for multimodal postoperative analgesia with 1000 mg of paracetamol, 75 mg of diclofenac, and 200 mg of tramadol. Postoperative nausea and vomiting prophylaxis was performed using 8 mg of dexamethasone. During the operation, vital signs were stable with a systolic blood pressure of 103-140 mm Hg, heart rate of 93-120 bpm without arrhythmia, and SpO<sub>2</sub> of 99-100%. At the end of the surgery, 400 mg of sugammadex was administered and emergence from anesthesia and extubation were performed after obtaining a TOF ratio > 0.9 and the patient was awake (eye-opening and responding to commands). We completed the anesthesia procedure in 55 minutes (surgery lasted 32 minutes), with a total intraoperative fluid infusion volume of 600 mL, an estimated blood loss of 400 mL, and a total urinary output of 250 mL. The birth and recovery were safely managed without adverse events. In the postanesthesia care unit, a total of 8 mg of morphine and 25 mg of pethidine were administered. This case illustrates a 24-year-old woman with hEDS who underwent a cesarean section under general anesthesia.  hEDS is the most common type of EDS and is characterized by general features of EDS with less severe manifestations (e.g., mild skin stretch and scarring) [<xref rid=""REF7"" ref-type=""bibr"">7</xref>]. The prevalence of this syndrome is approximately one in 3200. No single pathogenic gene variant has been found to be related to the cause and inheritance and its pathophysiology is not understood: unlike the other types of EDS, no structural abnormality in collagen or related proteins has yet been identified. However, it is considered to have dominant inheritance with highly variable penetrance of signs and symptoms. The major clinical feature of hEDS includes joint hypermobility. Other common symptoms include the following (Table <xref rid=""TAB1"" ref-type=""table"">1</xref>): During pregnancy, these patients might experience higher rates of complications such as increased ligament laxity, injuries from malposition in labor, abdominal wall herniation, pelvic floor weakness, rapid progression of labor, wound healing deficiency, resistance to local anesthetics, fatigue, postural tachycardia syndrome, gastroesophageal reflux, and peripheral venous insufficiency [<xref rid=""REF7"" ref-type=""bibr"">7</xref>]. Despite these potential complications, pregnancy and delivery are relatively safe in patients with hEDS compared to patients with other forms of EDS [<xref rid=""REF10"" ref-type=""bibr"">10</xref>]. The mode of delivery remains controversial: uterine or bowel rupture, extensive perineal trauma, and delayed wound healing are complications for both vaginal delivery and cesarean section [<xref rid=""REF11"" ref-type=""bibr"">11</xref>]. In addition, episiotomy is related to pelvic prolapse in hEDS patients. Therefore, cesarean section may be considered as the first delivery option in this EDS subtype. Endotracheal intubation can be challenging due to the collapse of the tracheal cartilage, cervical spine instability, and temporomandibular joint dysfunction [<xref rid=""REF10"" ref-type=""bibr"">10</xref>]. BURP maneuver can occlude the trachea and affect the view during laryngoscopy. These difficulties might be overcome with the use of videolaryngoscopy, intubating laryngeal mask airway devices, or fiberoptic bronchoscopes. Mechanical ventilation places these patients at higher risk of oral and laryngeal hematomas and pneumothoraces.  Neuraxial anesthesia is also related to complications such as an increased rate of PDPH. Spinal pathology might affect the technique, making previous imaging exams useful [<xref rid=""REF4"" ref-type=""bibr"">4</xref>]. There is no definite recommendation for either general or regional anesthesia, and several case reports and case series of neuraxial anesthesia and peripheral nerve blocks have reported no complications. However, due to the possible disadvantages of neuraxial anesthesia (greater rate of PDPH, possible difficulties in the technique in the presence of spinal pathology, existence of isolated or multiple Tarlov cysts, and local anesthetic resistance) [<xref rid=""REF4"" ref-type=""bibr"">4</xref>,<xref rid=""REF5"" ref-type=""bibr"">5</xref>], general anesthesia was carried out in this case. It can be performed as balanced anesthesia with volatile anesthetics, nitrous oxide, or TIVA [<xref rid=""REF4"" ref-type=""bibr"">4</xref>,<xref rid=""REF11"" ref-type=""bibr"">11</xref>]. As mentioned above, there is an increased risk of a difficult airway, and several measures should be taken to avoid complications: careful mask ventilation (avoiding temporomandibular joint luxation), use of a smaller endotracheal tube (avoiding mucosal damage) with regular verification of the cuff pressure, and lung-protective ventilation (avoiding pneumothorax) [<xref rid=""REF11"" ref-type=""bibr"">11</xref>,<xref rid=""REF12"" ref-type=""bibr"">12</xref>]. We followed these guidelines, along with orotracheal intubation using a videolaryngoscope (minimizing temporomandibular and occipitoatlantoaxial joint luxation). Due to the possibility of formation of hematomas, joint dislocations, bruises on the skin, and peripheral neuropathy, mobilization and positioning were carried out with great caution, with padding and protection of pressure areas [<xref rid=""REF13"" ref-type=""bibr"">13</xref>]. General anesthesia was maintained using a mixture of air, oxygen, nitrous oxide, and sevoflurane. The literature advocates non-invasive monitoring whenever possible. However, given the fact that some patients develop extensive hematoma from repetitive non-invasive blood pressure measurements and the lack of an EDS subtype with vascular fragility (hence decreasing the risk of vascular wall dissection with arterial cannulation), invasive blood pressure monitoring was initiated. Postoperative care should focus on the development of bleeding and hematoma at the surgical site, as postpartum hemorrhage and complicated perineal lacerations occur more often than in the general population [<xref rid=""REF14"" ref-type=""bibr"">14</xref>]. Early mobilization is important in order to prevent excessive deconditioning and unexpected deterioration of the musculoskeletal system and cardiovascular reactivity. In this case, the postoperative period was uneventful.  This case illustrates a successful cesarean delivery in a patient with hEDS under general anesthesia. A multidisciplinary approach and timely decision-making during the peripartum period ensure safe management in the hEDS setting. There are no general recommendations regarding the type of delivery and anesthesia for patients with hEDS. Temporomandibular joint luxation, cervical spine instability, risk of pneumothorax, and oral/laryngeal hematomas are possible complications of general anesthesia. Spinal pathology may condition the technique for neuraxial anesthesia and there is an increased risk of PDPH and resistance to local anesthetic.",N/A,1 10 2024
Decoding the Genetic Basis of Mast Cell Hypersensitivity and Infection Risk in Hypermobile Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome,"Hypermobile Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (hEDS) is a connective tissue disorder marked by joint hypermobility, skin hyperextensibility, and tissue fragility. Recent studies have linked hEDS with mast cell activation syndrome (MCAS), suggesting a genetic interplay affecting immune regulation and infection susceptibility. This study aims to decode the genetic basis of mast cell hypersensitivity and increased infection risk in hEDS by identifying specific genetic variants associated with these conditions. We conducted whole-genome sequencing (WGS) on 18 hEDS participants and 7 first-degree relatives as controls, focusing on identifying genetic variants associated with mast cell dysregulation. Participants underwent clinical assessments to document hEDS symptoms and mast cell hypersensitivity, with particular attention to past infections and antihistamine response. Our analysis identified specific genetic variants in MT-CYB, HTT, MUC3A, HLA-B and HLA-DRB1, which are implicated in hEDS and MCAS. Protein–protein interaction (PPI) network analysis revealed significant interactions among identified variants, highlighting their involvement in pathways related to antigen processing, mucosal protection, and collagen synthesis. Notably, 61.1% of the hEDS cohort reported recurrent infections compared to 28.5% in controls, and 72.2% had documented mast cell hypersensitivity versus 14.2% in controls. These findings provide a plausible explanation for the complex interplay between connective tissue abnormalities and immune dysregulation in hEDS. The identified genetic variants offer insights into potential therapeutic targets for modulating mast cell activity and improving patient outcomes. Future research should validate these findings in larger cohorts and explore the functional implications of these variants to develop effective treatment strategies for hEDS and related mast cell disorders.","Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (EDS) comprises a group of inherited connective tissue disorders characterized by joint hypermobility, skin hyperextensibility, and tissue fragility [<xref rid=""B1-cimb-46-00689"" ref-type=""bibr"">1</xref>,<xref rid=""B2-cimb-46-00689"" ref-type=""bibr"">2</xref>]. Among the various subtypes, hypermobile EDS (hEDS) is the most common form, yet its genetic basis remains elusive [<xref rid=""B3-cimb-46-00689"" ref-type=""bibr"">3</xref>,<xref rid=""B4-cimb-46-00689"" ref-type=""bibr"">4</xref>]. Recent studies have highlighted a significant association between hEDS and mast cell activation syndrome (MCAS), suggesting a complex interplay between connective tissue disorders and immune dysregulation [<xref rid=""B5-cimb-46-00689"" ref-type=""bibr"">5</xref>,<xref rid=""B6-cimb-46-00689"" ref-type=""bibr"">6</xref>]. Mast cell hypersensitivity has emerged as a common phenotype in patients with hEDS. A study by Seneviratne et al. found that 66% of patients with hEDS also met the diagnostic criteria for MCAS [<xref rid=""B7-cimb-46-00689"" ref-type=""bibr"">7</xref>]. Similarly, studies reported a high prevalence of MCAS in hEDS patients, with overlapping symptoms including chronic pain, fatigue, and gastrointestinal disturbances [<xref rid=""B8-cimb-46-00689"" ref-type=""bibr"">8</xref>,<xref rid=""B9-cimb-46-00689"" ref-type=""bibr"">9</xref>]. These findings indicate that mast cell dysfunction may play a crucial role in the multisystemic manifestations of hEDS. Recent studies have provided additional evidence supporting the hypothesis of a connection between hEDS and MCAS. A cohort analysis conducted in an allergy/immunology clinic found that a significant number of patients with suspected MCAS also had diagnoses of hEDS or hypermobility spectrum disorder (HSD), alongside primary immune deficiencies such as immunoglobulin deficiency [<xref rid=""B10-cimb-46-00689"" ref-type=""bibr"">10</xref>]. Of the 974 patients analyzed, 10% had both MCAS and hEDS/HSD, and 19% had a combination of MCAS, hEDS/HSD, and immunoglobulin deficiency [<xref rid=""B10-cimb-46-00689"" ref-type=""bibr"">10</xref>]. This suggests a notable overlap between these conditions and highlights the need to explore underlying contributors to chronic inflammation and tissue injury in hEDS patients [<xref rid=""B10-cimb-46-00689"" ref-type=""bibr"">10</xref>]. The potential connection between hEDS and mast cell-related disorders may be explained by the presence of mast cell mediators, especially tryptase and histamine, which can affect multiple organ systems [<xref rid=""B10-cimb-46-00689"" ref-type=""bibr"">10</xref>,<xref rid=""B11-cimb-46-00689"" ref-type=""bibr"">11</xref>]. Immunohistochemistry analysis has identified an increased chymase (a mast cell product) content in undamaged skin of patients with signs of connective tissue disorders [<xref rid=""B7-cimb-46-00689"" ref-type=""bibr"">7</xref>,<xref rid=""B12-cimb-46-00689"" ref-type=""bibr"">12</xref>]. This suggests an intrinsic alteration in mast cell function or distribution in hEDS patients. Interestingly, patients with hEDS have also been observed to have an increased susceptibility to a wide range of infections. Boileau et al. [<xref rid=""B13-cimb-46-00689"" ref-type=""bibr"">13</xref>] reported a higher incidence of recurrent infections, particularly urinary tract infections, in hEDS patients compared to the general population. Moreover, a functional analysis of fibroblasts from patients with joint hypermobility syndrome (JHS) and hypermobile Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (hEDS) revealed that these patients exhibited altered immune responses, including decreased cytokine production, which may contribute to their increased risk of infections [<xref rid=""B14-cimb-46-00689"" ref-type=""bibr"">14</xref>]. The relationship between mast cell hypersensitivity and infection susceptibility is complex and bidirectional. Mast cells play a crucial role in innate immunity and host defense against pathogens [<xref rid=""B15-cimb-46-00689"" ref-type=""bibr"">15</xref>,<xref rid=""B16-cimb-46-00689"" ref-type=""bibr"">16</xref>,<xref rid=""B17-cimb-46-00689"" ref-type=""bibr"">17</xref>]. However, dysregulated mast cell activation can lead to excessive inflammation and tissue damage, potentially increasing vulnerability to infections [<xref rid=""B15-cimb-46-00689"" ref-type=""bibr"">15</xref>,<xref rid=""B16-cimb-46-00689"" ref-type=""bibr"">16</xref>,<xref rid=""B17-cimb-46-00689"" ref-type=""bibr"">17</xref>,<xref rid=""B18-cimb-46-00689"" ref-type=""bibr"">18</xref>]. Conversely, recurrent infections may trigger chronic mast cell activation, creating a vicious cycle of immune dysregulation [<xref rid=""B19-cimb-46-00689"" ref-type=""bibr"">19</xref>,<xref rid=""B20-cimb-46-00689"" ref-type=""bibr"">20</xref>,<xref rid=""B21-cimb-46-00689"" ref-type=""bibr"">21</xref>]. Recent epidemiological data further support the association between hEDS and MCAS. A study using the National Inpatient Sample found that nearly one in three patients diagnosed with MCAS have a comorbid diagnosis of hEDS [<xref rid=""B21-cimb-46-00689"" ref-type=""bibr"">21</xref>]. This association appeared to increase over time with the increasing diagnosis of MCAS, suggesting a growing recognition of the overlap between these conditions [<xref rid=""B7-cimb-46-00689"" ref-type=""bibr"">7</xref>,<xref rid=""B21-cimb-46-00689"" ref-type=""bibr"">21</xref>]. Despite these observations, the genetic underpinnings of hEDS, mast cell hypersensitivity, and infection susceptibility in these patients remain poorly understood. While several genes have been implicated in other EDS subtypes, the causative factors and mechanisms for hEDS and its associated comorbidities are largely unknown [<xref rid=""B3-cimb-46-00689"" ref-type=""bibr"">3</xref>,<xref rid=""B4-cimb-46-00689"" ref-type=""bibr"">4</xref>]. This knowledge gap highlights the need for comprehensive genetic studies to elucidate the molecular basis of these interrelated phenomena [<xref rid=""B1-cimb-46-00689"" ref-type=""bibr"">1</xref>,<xref rid=""B2-cimb-46-00689"" ref-type=""bibr"">2</xref>]. To explore these observations further, we conducted whole-genome sequencing in 18 participants with hypermobile Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (hEDS) alongside their 7 first-degree relatives as controls. Our study aims to explore the hypothesis that mast cell hypersensitivity or activation is more prevalent in hEDS participants compared to the general population, and that they also experience higher infection rates. Additionally, we seek to uncover genetic variations associated with hEDS by identifying alterations related to mast cell function and immune system regulation. This research has the potential to illuminate the complex pathophysiology of hEDS and its associated immune dysregulation, providing insights into the genetic basis of these interconnected conditions.  In this study, we conducted a genomic evaluation of 18 participants diagnosed with hypermobile Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (hEDS) and 7 first-degree relatives who served as controls. The mean age of the hEDS participants was 17.4 years, with ages ranging from 1 to 60 years, and 38.8% (<italic toggle=""yes"">n</italic> = 7) of the participants were female. In the control group, the mean age was 55.8 years, with ages ranging from 39 to 73 years, and 42.8% (<italic toggle=""yes"">n</italic> = 3) were female. A significant portion of the hEDS cohort, 61.1% (<italic toggle=""yes"">n</italic> = 11), reported a history of recurrent infections, in contrast to 28.5% (<italic toggle=""yes"">n</italic> = 2) in the control group. Additionally, 72.2% (<italic toggle=""yes"">n</italic> = 13) of the hEDS participants had a documented medical history of mast cell hypersensitivity, compared to only 14.2% (<italic toggle=""yes"">n</italic> = 1) among the controls. Our study offers significant insights into the genetic basis of hypermobile Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (hEDS) and its association with mast cell hypersensitivity and increased susceptibility to infections. By conducting whole-genome sequencing (WGS) on a cohort of hEDS participants and their relatives, we identified several genetic variations that may contribute to these complex clinical manifestations. The identification of specific genetic variants associated with mast cell dysregulation in hEDS, such as those in the MT-CYB, HTT, MUC3A, HLA-B, and HLA-DRB1genes, underscores the potential role of these variants in the pathophysiology of hEDS. These findings align with previous studies that have highlighted the prevalence of mast cell activation syndrome (MCAS) in hEDS, suggesting a shared genetic basis for these conditions. Notably, our research has identified a novel variant, p.(Leu119Trp), in the HLA-B gene. This missense variant, not previously reported, could potentially alter the structure of the HLA-B protein, a crucial component in antigen presentation and immune response modulation. The discovery of this variant in more than half of the hEDS participants, particularly those with mast cell hypersensitivity, and its absence in the control group suggests its potential as a biomarker for hEDS. The structural changes induced by this variant might affect the protein’s ability to present antigens, thereby influencing immune recognition and response. This finding highlights the role of the immune system in the pathophysiology of hEDS and opens avenues for targeted therapeutic interventions. The presence of HLA-B variants, in particular, may indicate an immune-mediated component to the disorder, as HLA-B is involved in antigen presentation and immune response modulation [<xref rid=""B47-cimb-46-00689"" ref-type=""bibr"">47</xref>]. Research has shown that HLA-B variants can influence the immune system’s ability to recognize and respond to pathogens [<xref rid=""B53-cimb-46-00689"" ref-type=""bibr"">53</xref>,<xref rid=""B54-cimb-46-00689"" ref-type=""bibr"">54</xref>], potentially leading to altered immune responses in hEDS. This aligns with studies reporting increased susceptibility to infections in hEDS, possibly due to compromised immune function [<xref rid=""B13-cimb-46-00689"" ref-type=""bibr"">13</xref>,<xref rid=""B14-cimb-46-00689"" ref-type=""bibr"">14</xref>]. The presence of MUC genes, known for their role in forming protective mucus barriers [<xref rid=""B55-cimb-46-00689"" ref-type=""bibr"">55</xref>], highlights a potential mechanism for the increased susceptibility to infections observed in hEDS participants. This is consistent with studies that have reported altered immune responses and increased infection rates in hEDS populations [<xref rid=""B13-cimb-46-00689"" ref-type=""bibr"">13</xref>,<xref rid=""B14-cimb-46-00689"" ref-type=""bibr"">14</xref>]. MT-CYB is involved in mitochondrial function and energy production, which are crucial for the high-energy demands of bone formation and maintenance. Mitochondria play a role in mast cell activation, where adequate ATP levels are essential for FcεRI-dependent activation [<xref rid=""B56-cimb-46-00689"" ref-type=""bibr"">56</xref>]. This supports our finding that variations in MT-CYB may contribute to mast cell dysregulation observed in hEDS patients. HTT has been shown to participate in cytokine production processes in mast cells, affecting inflammatory responses [<xref rid=""B57-cimb-46-00689"" ref-type=""bibr"">57</xref>]. This suggests that HTT variants may contribute to immune dysregulation seen in hEDS. Additionally, our research identified variants in genes such as ZNF521, ZNF717, RUNX2, and MMP16, which are implicated in bone mineralization and osteoblast differentiation, potentially explaining the higher fracture rates observed in hEDS patients. ZNF521 is a transcription factor known to repress osteoblastic differentiation [<xref rid=""B58-cimb-46-00689"" ref-type=""bibr"">58</xref>]. Studies have shown that ZNF521 inhibits the maturation of osteoblasts by reducing the expression of key osteogenic markers like collagen I, alkaline phosphatase, and osteopontin, leading to decreased matrix mineralization [<xref rid=""B58-cimb-46-00689"" ref-type=""bibr"">58</xref>]. This repression could contribute to weaker bone structure in hEDS patients, increasing fracture risk even at an early age. RUNX2 is a critical transcription factor for bone development, regulating genes involved in osteoblast differentiation and bone matrix production [<xref rid=""B59-cimb-46-00689"" ref-type=""bibr"">59</xref>]. RUNX2 promotes the maturation of chondrocytes and their transdifferentiation into osteoblasts, essential for normal bone formation during development [<xref rid=""B59-cimb-46-00689"" ref-type=""bibr"">59</xref>]. Variants affecting RUNX2 function can disrupt these processes, potentially leading to compromised bone integrity and increased fracture susceptibility in hEDS individuals. MMP16 plays a role in remodeling the extracellular matrix by degrading collagen and other matrix components [<xref rid=""B60-cimb-46-00689"" ref-type=""bibr"">60</xref>]. Alterations in MMP16 activity can affect the structural integrity of connective tissues, contributing to the fragility observed in hEDS. This gene’s involvement in collagen turnover highlights its potential impact on maintaining bone strength. Mitochondrial dysfunction can impair osteoblast activity, leading to compromised bone strength and increased fracture risk. A study by Guo et al. [<xref rid=""B61-cimb-46-00689"" ref-type=""bibr"">61</xref>] highlighted the importance of mitochondrial DNA variants in influencing bone mineral density (BMD) and the risk of osteoporosis, suggesting that mitochondrial dysfunction could impact bone health. HLA-B and HLA-DRB1 are part of the major histocompatibility complex involved in immune response regulation. Variants in these genes have been linked to osteoporosis and reduced bone mineral density, suggesting a role in bone health through immune-mediated pathways [<xref rid=""B62-cimb-46-00689"" ref-type=""bibr"">62</xref>]. The presence of HLA-B variants implies an immune-mediated component to hEDS, given their role in antigen presentation and immune response modulation. The identification of these genetic variants aligns with previous studies highlighting the prevalence of MCAS in hEDS, suggesting a shared genetic basis for these conditions. Mast cells are known to influence bone metabolism by regulating osteoclastogenesis and osteoblast activity [<xref rid=""B63-cimb-46-00689"" ref-type=""bibr"">63</xref>]. Dysregulated mast cell activation can lead to excessive inflammation and tissue damage, potentially increasing vulnerability to fractures [<xref rid=""B63-cimb-46-00689"" ref-type=""bibr"">63</xref>]. Overall, these genetic variants provide a plausible explanation for the complex interplay between connective tissue abnormalities and immune dysregulation in hEDS. The identification of these variants not only enhances our understanding of the genetic basis of hEDS but also opens avenues for targeted therapeutic interventions aimed at modulating mast cell activity and improving patient outcomes. Future studies should focus on validating these findings in larger cohorts and exploring the functional implications of these variants to develop effective treatment strategies for hEDS and associated mast cell disorders. Our approach to variant filtering, focusing on genes involved in mast cell hypersensitivity and excluding variants present in controls, allowed us to pinpoint genetic factors that may be unique to hEDS. This is supported by the clustering of variants in pathways related to connective tissue integrity and immune function, providing a plausible link between genetic predisposition and clinical phenotype. Despite the promising findings, our study has several limitations that need to be acknowledged. The relatively small sample size is a significant limitation, as it may affect the generalizability of our results. Although our study design included first-degree relatives as controls to account for shared genetic and environmental factors, the limited number of participants restricts the statistical power and robustness of our conclusions. Future research should aim to include larger, more diverse cohorts to validate these findings and explore the genetic landscape of hypermobile Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (hEDS) more comprehensively. Additionally, while we have identified genetic associations that suggest a potential role in mast cell dysregulation and infection susceptibility in hEDS, functional studies are necessary to elucidate the precise biological mechanisms involved. The complexity of hEDS suggests that other genetic or environmental factors may also contribute to its pathophysiology. Therefore, integrating genomic data with environmental and lifestyle factors could provide a more holistic understanding of hEDS. Another limitation is the age disparity between hEDS participants and control groups, which may introduce confounding variables related to age-dependent immune function differences. Future studies should strive to include age-matched controls to minimize these potential biases. Finally, while our use of whole-genome sequencing (WGS) provides comprehensive coverage of genetic variants, it is essential to complement these findings with biochemical analyses such as cytokine profiling or mast cell activation markers in blood or saliva. These additional data could offer insights into systemic inflammation and immune dysregulation in hEDS. In conclusion, while our study lays the groundwork for understanding the genetic basis of hEDS, further research is crucial for confirming these associations and developing targeted therapeutic strategies. Our study provides insights into the potential genetic basis of hypermobile Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (hEDS) and its associated comorbidities, such as mast cell hypersensitivity and increased infection susceptibility. By identifying certain genetic variants and pathways through whole-genome sequencing, we have established a foundation for future research that could inform the development of targeted therapies and improved diagnostic criteria for hEDS and related mast cell disorders. However, while our findings are promising, they are not definitively conclusive. The identification of specific genetic variants, including those in MT-CYB, HTT, MUC3A, HLA-B, and HLA-DRB1, suggests a possible role of these genes in the pathophysiology of hEDS. These findings align with previous studies that indicate a prevalence of mast cell activation syndrome (MCAS) in hEDS and suggest a potential shared genetic basis for these conditions. Notably, the presence of HLA-B variants implies an immune-mediated component to the disorder, given their role in antigen presentation and immune response modulation. Nevertheless, our study has limitations that must be acknowledged. The relatively small sample size means that these findings should be viewed as preliminary. Further research with larger cohorts is necessary to validate these results and to explore the functional implications of these variants more thoroughly. Additionally, while we have identified potential genetic associations, the complexity of hEDS suggests that other genetic or environmental factors may also play significant roles. Continued investigation is crucial for developing effective diagnostic and treatment strategies and enhancing our understanding of hEDS.

Vascular dissection or rupture, gastrointestinal perforation, or organ rupture are the presenting signs in most adults with vEDS [<xref rid=""bb0005"" ref-type=""bibr"">1</xref>]. Also known as congenital connective tissue hypoplasia syndrome, Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome (EDS) represents a class of collagen disorders among the wider group of heritable connective tissue diseases [<xref rid=""bb0010"" ref-type=""bibr"">2</xref>]. The article discusses a 25-year-old patient who was diagnosed with vascular Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (vEDS), a rare genetic disorder, in a tertiary care hospital located in Beirut, Lebanon. The patient's case was notable for its atypical presentation, making it a challenging diagnosis. Consent for the case study was obtained from both the patient and her family, ensuring that all ethical considerations were met. The report has been meticulously documented following the SCARE criteria, which provide guidelines for the structured reporting of surgical and clinical case studies. [<xref rid=""bb0015"" ref-type=""bibr"">3</xref>] This is the case of a 25-year-old female patient with a history of undocumented hemoptysis in early childhood and repair of varicose veins in the lower extremities who presented in December 2018 with acute abdominal pain. The patient was diagnosed with acute peritonitis, and an urgent laparotomy revealed a perforated sigmoid colon, leading to an urgent Hartmann procedure. She was discharged six weeks later with a functional colostomy after receiving a course of antibiotics. Seven months later, the patient was admitted for closure of the colostomy. An end-to-end anastomosis was performed without complications. The basic workup showed no abnormalities in her labs, and investigations at that time (no genetic test was done) came back negative. In August 2023, the patient presented with acute abdominal pain. An urgent CT scan revealed peritonitis, leading to urgent admission to the ICU. A subsequent urgent laparotomy showed a perforation in the descending colon, next to the previous anastomosis. An extended colectomy was performed, and a transverse colostomy was created. Multiple small bowel perforations were also present and treated with resection-anastomosis. The patient lost about 1.5 l of blood during the operation, for which she received multiple transfusions. She was admitted to the ICU for two weeks, with a total hospital stay of two months. This stay was complicated by various infections and wound infections, as well as enterocutaneous fistulas, which were managed conservatively. Pathology results showed multiple perforations in the resected small bowel and colonic wall, with marked inflammatory infiltrate from the mucosa to the serosal surface, covered by fibrinopurulent exudate containing clusters of giant cells. The bowel wall showed focal thinning of the muscular propria and dilated congested submucosal and serosal blood vessels. Because of these unusual findings in pathology results, the patient was then tested for genetic disease diagnosed with vEDS, and was prescribed a multivitamin regimen along with a daily dose of vitamin C. A follow-up CT scan of the abdomen in December 2023 revealed a saccular aneurysm measuring 18 × 17 mm originating from the proximal proper hepatic artery (<xref rid=""f0005"" ref-type=""fig"">Fig. 1</xref>).<fig id=""f0005""><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>Arrow: hepatic artery aneurysm.</p></caption><alt-text id=""al0005"">Fig. 1</alt-text><graphic http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink href=""gr1"" id=""lk0005""></graphic></fig> Additionally, a branch of the left hepatic artery was dilated (11 mm) and communicated with a significantly dilated distal left portal vein, associated with early arterial hyper-enhancement of the left hepatic lobe, suggestive of portosystemic shunting secondary to arteriovenous fistula (<xref rid=""f0010"" ref-type=""fig"">Fig. 2</xref>).

A CT scan revealed a large abdominal collection, most likely due to a new bowel perforation (<xref rid=""f0015"" ref-type=""fig"">Fig. 3</xref>). The decision was made to perform bilateral drainage of the abdomen, and the patient was administered broad-spectrum antibiotics and intensive hydration.<fig id=""f0015""><label>Fig. 3</label><caption><p>Abdominal collection due to bowel perforation.</p></caption><alt-text id=""al0015"">Fig. 3</alt-text><graphic http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink href=""gr3"" id=""lk0015""></graphic></fig> On Day 4, despite optimal medical management, the patient presented severe abdominal pain, tachycardia, and hypotension, necessitating urgent transfer to the operating room for laparotomy. During laparotomy, multiple transverse colon perforations with stercoral peritonitis and a retracted stoma were identified. Additionally, many small bowel perforations were found after an exhaustive adhesiolysis of the friable tissues. Multiple small bowel anastomoses were performed, and an extended colectomy was performed, alongside an ascending colostomy. Intensive abdominal lavage with more than 10 l of fluid was conducted, and three abdominal drains were placed. The patient was then transferred to the ICU, where she received multiple transfusions due to significant blood loss during surgery. She underwent a course of several antibiotics for severe multiresistant multi-bacterial infection. Her ICU stay lasted for 7 days. On Day 5, she developed an enterocutaneous fistula with wound infection, which was managed conservatively with total parenteral nutrition, NG tube insertion, and wound care. During her hospital stay, on Day 19, the patient experienced intense left arm and hand pain, particularly in the last two digits. Imaging revealed an aneurysm measuring 4.2 cm in the right paraspinal muscles between the spinous processes of T3 and T4 (<xref rid=""f0020"" ref-type=""fig"">Fig. 4</xref>), along with a 2 × 1 cm aneurysm at the level of the left wrist in the hypothenar compartment just after Guyon's canal (<xref rid=""f0025"" ref-type=""fig"">Fig. 5</xref>). This aneurysm, measuring approximately 20 × 10 mm, exerted a mass effect on the ulnar nerve at this level. A cervical MRI was also performed for posterior neck pain and showed a 25 × 21 mm false aneurysm in the right paraspinal muscles between the spinous processes of T3 and T4. A decision was made to intervene radiologically and embolize this aneurysm due to its risk of bleeding, using the coiling technique (<xref rid=""f0030"" ref-type=""fig"">Fig. 6</xref>).

The Sanger sequencing method was used to validate the results in the patient (<xref rid=""f0040"" ref-type=""fig"">Fig. 8</xref>, II.1) and the patient's family members (<xref rid=""f0040"" ref-type=""fig"">Fig. 8</xref>, I.1, I.2 and II.1). Oligonucleotide primers were designed using the Primer 3.0 tool to amplify the exon23-intron junction of the COL3A1 gene. PCR amplification was carried out using the QIAGEN Multiplex PCR Master Mix. DNA sequencing was sequenced in both directions (Forward and Reverse). PCR products were purified and sequenced on the ABI 3500 Genetic Analyzer. The sequencing data were analyzed using the ChomasPro software, version 2.1.9. The heterozygous COL3A1 variant was confirmed in the patient (<xref rid=""f0040"" ref-type=""fig"">Fig. 8</xref>, II.2), while none of the other family members carried the variant. This indicates that the variant is de novo, and was not inherited from either parent. This information was communicated to the family, explaining that it is a de novo variant, neither parent is a carrier, and there is no risk for the brother. Numerous cases of vascular Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome (vEDS) have been documented, often involving a history of recurrent bowel perforations [<xref rid=""bb0020"" ref-type=""bibr"">[4]</xref>, <xref rid=""bb0025"" ref-type=""bibr"">[5]</xref>, <xref rid=""bb0030"" ref-type=""bibr"">[6]</xref>], ruptured aneurysms [<xref rid=""bb0035"" ref-type=""bibr"">7</xref>], and various types of fistulas [<xref rid=""bb0040"" ref-type=""bibr"">8</xref>]. Our case stands out as a stark illustration of the severity inherent in this syndrome and the immense challenges it presents for management. The current case can help establish management plans in front of such presentations. This patient exhibited multiple rapidly growing aneurysms, some of which manifested symptoms due to their impact on nearby structures. Moreover, the last laparotomy underscored the daunting nature of this condition, with abundant necrotic tissue and exceedingly fragile materiel found in the bowel, mesentery, and skin. Such complexities emphasize the critical need for heightened vigilance and comprehensive care strategies in managing vEDS cases. Our case was particularly noteworthy for several reasons: firstly, it involved a young patient with vascular Ehlers-Danlos disease, which differs from many case reports that typically describe older cases. Secondly, unlike many patients who are diagnosed post-mortem during autopsies following ruptured aneurysms and sudden death, our case was diagnosed during active management. Thirdly, the simultaneous presentation of bowel perforation and multiple aneurysms added to the complexity and uniqueness of this case. Lastly, the management course and the preventive measures taken have added value to the literature when encountering such different presentations. The rapid diagnosis and vigilant monitoring of patients with vascular Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome (vEDS) are paramount, needing multiple emergency room visits for any new symptoms or pain in this population. Prompt management is crucial, underscoring the utmost importance placed on patient care and safety. This often entails a series of interventions, prolonged hospital stays, long-term antibiotic therapy, and meticulous attention to supporting proper nutrition, along with comprehensive patient counseling. The medical management of vascular Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (vEDS) remains a subject of debate and lacks robust evidence. While medications such as celiprolol, a beta-blocker, have shown promise in reducing arterial events, the overall efficacy and safety of various medical therapies are not conclusively established. The limited number of studies and their small sample sizes make it challenging to develop definitive guidelines. Therefore, while some treatments show potential, their use should be considered cautiously and on an individual basis [<xref rid=""bb0045"" ref-type=""bibr"">9</xref>]. Vascular lesions of vEDS have traditionally been treated conservatively because of elevated rates of intraoperative and postoperative complications in this population [<xref rid=""bb0050"" ref-type=""bibr"">10</xref>]. While still not well established and lacking clear guidelines for management, elective surgical treatment of vascular disorders in EDS patients using open and endovascular procedures has been associated with good outcomes. Results suggest that vascular interventions in these EDS patients can be safely performed and should not be withheld until rupture or acute symptoms arise [<xref rid=""bb0055"" ref-type=""bibr"">11</xref>]. A multidisciplinary approach remains essential for the optimal management of vEDS, as it encompasses various medical specialties including digestive surgery, internal medicine, interventional radiology, and vascular surgery. Timely interventions are imperative, and any new symptoms experienced by the patient should be thoroughly investigated to prevent potential complications. While vEDS is a rare condition, its significance cannot be understated, particularly in cases of recurrent intestinal perforations [<xref rid=""bb0060"" ref-type=""bibr"">12</xref>]. This case serves as a poignant reminder of the critical importance of early and exact diagnosis, genetic counseling, and the implementation of appropriate procedures in patients with vEDS [<xref rid=""bb0010"" ref-type=""bibr"">2</xref>]. Indeed, it is crucial to acknowledge the substantial burden and profound psychological impact on both the patient's mental health and their family dynamics. The constant fear of potential complications and the uncertainty surrounding the course of the disease can significantly exacerbate anxiety levels. This heightened state of anxiety not only affects the patient's overall well-being but also has ripple effects on their familial support system. The persistent threat of life-threatening events such as bowel perforations or ruptured aneurysms looms large, casting a shadow over every aspect of daily life. Moreover, the psychological impact extends beyond the individual patient, affecting the entire family unit. Addressing the psychological well-being of patients with vEDS and their families is therefore an integral part of comprehensive care. Supportive interventions, such as counseling, psychoeducation, and access to mental health resources, play a crucial role in mitigating the emotional strain associated with living with vEDS. By acknowledging and addressing these psychological challenges, healthcare providers can strive to enhance the overall quality of life for individuals and families affected by this complex condition. In conclusion, this case exemplifies a distinctive presentation and management of vascular Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (vEDS). The primary aim is to heighten awareness, encourage early diagnosis, and disseminate management strategies. A collaborative, multidisciplinary approach is crucial in effectively handling such complex cases while emphasizing the importance of active patient and caregiver involvement in the management plan.

6556 Does Autoimmune Hashimoto’s Hypothyroidism Mask the Diagnosis of Ehlers-Danlos-Syndrome?,"
<bold>Disclosure: S. Azmat:</bold> None. <bold>U. Rafat:</bold> None. <bold>J.L. Gilden:</bold> None. 
<bold>Does Autoimmune Hashimoto’s Hypothyroidism Mask the Diagnosis of Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome? Background:</bold> Hypothyroidism is well-known to be associated with muscle weakness and fatigue. There are other etiologies for decreased muscle tone such as Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (EDS) which is group of connective tissue disorders characterized by joint hypermobility, skin hyperextensibility and tissue fragility. Other rheumatological and cardiac conditions associated with this syndrome can pose diagnostic challenges. We present case of 32-year-old female presenting with facial muscle weakness and newly diagnosed Hashimoto’s hypothyroidism. We highlight importance of keeping EDS as another differential in patients with muscle weakness allowing for accurate, prompt diagnosis and treatment to be done in timely manner. <bold>Case Description:</bold> A 32-year-old female professional musician was referred to Endocrine for mouth muscles weakness and decreasing ability to play her French Horn wind instrument with vocal dystonia and the question of whether these were symptoms of hypothyroidism. She was noted to have mild thyroid enlargement and abnormal thyroid function tests with positive thyroid antibodies. Initial TSH was 7.506 uIU/mL(0.55-4.78), free T4 0.9 ng/dL (0.76-1.46), peroxidase antibody = 96,061U/mL (0-60) and thyroglobulin of 134.9 U/mL (0-60). She also reported low energy, intermittent difficulty swallowing and decreased muscle strength. There was no prior personal and family history of hypo/hyperthyroidism or any other disorders. VS were normal, physical exam showe d no thyromegaly, reflexes revealed objective decrease but normal muscle strength. The skin was noted to be hyperextensible with passive hyperextension of fifth metacarpophalangeal joint beyond 90 degrees, thumb to flexor aspect of forearm and elbows bilaterally with positive Beighton criteria for EDS. She later admitted to intermittent palpitations and easy bruising. Subsequent lab tests were negative ANA, anti-mitochondrial, PCEL and striated muscles antibodies. Additionally she had normal IGA, PTH, AM cortisol- ACTH, vitamin B12 levels with negative 21 hydroxylases antibodies and celiac titers. She was started on levothyroxine 25 mcg and recommended for Cardiology evaluation and genetic testing. Physiotherapy was started. Upon six months follow-up she clinically felt better with improved muscle strength, swallowing and energy level. Repeat lab testing showed improved TSH of 2.67 uIU/mL(0.55-4.78) with free T4 of 1.0 ng/dL (0.76-1.46). <bold>Conclusion:</bold> This case demonstrates that although muscle weakness can be symptom of hypothyroidism one must evaluate all patients for other possible causes. We highlight importance of keeping EDS as a differential especially in female patients with muscle weakness. Though history and physical exam is crucial allowing for prompt diagnosis and treatment for other conditions.

"The Effectiveness of Conservative Interventions on Pain, Function, and Quality of Life in Adults with Hypermobile Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome/Hypermobility Spectrum Disorders and Shoulder Symptoms: A Systematic Review",,"The review was conducted and reported in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analysis Protocols guidelines<xref rid=""bib0029"" ref-type=""bibr""><sup>29</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid=""bib0030"" ref-type=""bibr""><sup>30</sup></xref> and was registered with the International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews (CRD42023411166). Ethical approval was obtained from Coventry University Ethics Committee on March 24, 2023 (P145212).  This review aimed to present the available research on conservative interventions for shoulder symptoms in people living with hEDS/HSD. From the SMD results obtained, varying degrees of effect size are presented across all the interventions ranging from negligible to large, which may in part be because of the heterogeneity in the studies in terms of intervention type, outcome assessed, and duration of treatment. However, the SMDs offer valuable insights into the effects of conservative interventions on pain, function, disability, and quality of life in individuals with hEDS/HSD experiencing shoulder symptoms. The findings of the review highlight the role that low-load and high-load exercise holds in the rehabilitation process for this patient population, with positive effect sizes for the WOSI, pain, and functional activities of daily living. This data further contributed to the evidence required to justify the overall effectiveness of rehabilitation for this patient group.<xref rid=""bib0027"" ref-type=""bibr""><sup>27</sup></xref> Furthermore, this review provides insights into the importance of strength exercises<xref rid=""bib0050"" ref-type=""bibr""><sup>50</sup></xref> on pain, shoulder function, HRQoL, and kinesiophobia and of home-based exercise<xref rid=""bib0049"" ref-type=""bibr""><sup>49</sup></xref> on shoulder function and HRQoL. However, it emphasizes the importance of considering the delivery method and level of supervision required for individuals with hEDS/HSD and shoulder symptoms. In the 16-week trial conducted by Liaghat et al,<xref rid=""bib0050"" ref-type=""bibr""><sup>50</sup></xref> the 2 intervention groups differed in supervision levels, with the HEAVY group supervised twice a week and encouraged to self-train once a week, while the LIGHT group self-trained 3 times a week but received supervision at weeks 5 and 11 when new exercises were introduced. In the 6-month trial by Spanhove et al,<xref rid=""bib0049"" ref-type=""bibr""><sup>49</sup></xref> the participants received either a program that was designed on recent research on the management of hEDS/HSD or a program that was evidence-based for MDI of the shoulder. Both programs were closely monitored and adjusted based on participant feedback, investigating the most advantageous type, frequency, dosage, or delivery method that is safe for such a fragile patient population.<xref rid=""bib0053"" ref-type=""bibr""><sup>53</sup></xref> The positive SMDs observed may be attributed to the careful management of each intervention group participating in the home-based exercise programs, which provides a method of monitoring and ensuring accountability. Similarly, Liaghat et al<xref rid=""bib0050"" ref-type=""bibr""><sup>50</sup></xref> supervised both intervention groups in their study, recognizing that patients with hEDS/HSD may have decreased tissue stiffness<xref rid=""bib0054"" ref-type=""bibr""><sup>54</sup></xref> and difficulties performing strengthening exercises unsupervised.<xref rid=""bib0050"" ref-type=""bibr""><sup>50</sup></xref> Therefore, supervision by a therapist may have allowed for better management of potential adverse events and load progression.<xref rid=""bib0050"" ref-type=""bibr""><sup>50</sup></xref> However, while supervised exercise and self-training are equally effective for shoulder conditions,<xref rid=""bib0055"" ref-type=""bibr""><sup>55</sup></xref> this evidence does not specifically address hEDS/HSD, where mechanical shoulder symptoms such as subluxation or instability are highly prevalent.<xref rid=""bib0019"" ref-type=""bibr""><sup>19</sup></xref> Spanhove et al<xref rid=""bib0049"" ref-type=""bibr""><sup>49</sup></xref> also shed light on the comorbidities and challenges faced by individuals with hEDS/HSD such as fatigue<xref rid=""bib0056"" ref-type=""bibr""><sup>56</sup></xref> and dysautonomia,<xref rid=""bib0057"" ref-type=""bibr""><sup>57</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid=""bib0058"" ref-type=""bibr""><sup>58</sup></xref> which may hinder their ability to attend appointments in person. The study by Spanhove et al<xref rid=""bib0049"" ref-type=""bibr""><sup>49</sup></xref> underscores the significance of facilitating home-based exercise programs, proposing that individuals with hEDS/HSD can experience functional improvements through monitored home-based exercise regimes conducted in a consistent and comfortable environment. The findings of the review highlight the potential benefit of strength exercises and home-based programs in managing shoulder symptoms in individuals with hEDS/HSD. Further research is warranted to explore optimal intervention types, frequencies, dosages, and delivery methods tailored to the needs of this patient population. The SMDs from kinesiophobia draw attention to the importance of considering how fear of movement may be improved in individuals with hEDS/HSD when exercising. SMDs from the Spanhove et al<xref rid=""bib0049"" ref-type=""bibr""><sup>49</sup></xref> results exhibited negligible effect sizes for both groups. However, a supervised approach is more effective in improving kinesiophobia in hEDS/HSD.<xref rid=""bib0049"" ref-type=""bibr""><sup>49</sup></xref> Previous research also contributes to the reported associations between hEDS/HSD and fear of movement, emphasizing the need for further investigation into the complexities of this phenomenon within the hEDS/HSD context<xref rid=""bib0059"" ref-type=""bibr""><sup>59</sup></xref> and that significant reductions in kinesiophobia can be found when a multidisciplinary team is utilized.<xref rid=""bib0060"" ref-type=""bibr""><sup>60</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid=""bib0061"" ref-type=""bibr""><sup>61</sup></xref> While there is potential efficacy observed in both low-load and high-load exercises, as well as in the delivery methods of these exercises, additional research is required to identify the optimal frequency, intensity, duration, and specific types of resistance exercise suitable for individuals with hEDS/HSD to engage in independent exercise without posing a fear of injury. Addressing the fear of movement in this patient population is crucial to enabling the emerging benefits of exercise while mitigating the risk of injury.<xref rid=""bib0059"" ref-type=""bibr""><sup>59</sup></xref> This fear and risk of injury underscore the importance of designing future studies focused on refining exercise parameters for people living with hEDS/HSD. The review highlights emerging evidence supporting the positive effect of KT<xref rid=""bib0048"" ref-type=""bibr""><sup>48</sup></xref> and compression orthoses<xref rid=""bib0047"" ref-type=""bibr""><sup>47</sup></xref> on individuals with hEDS/HSD experiencing shoulder symptoms. Although the short follow-up periods within these 2 studies limit conclusive findings, the SMD calculations suggest a reduction in pain and improvement in function/WOSI with the utilization of KT.<xref rid=""bib0048"" ref-type=""bibr""><sup>48</sup></xref> Mechanically, the positive effects of KT were attributed to improved proprioception; however, proprioceptive outcomes were not measured in the work by Tudini et al.<xref rid=""bib0048"" ref-type=""bibr""><sup>48</sup></xref> As such, further research is warranted to explore the underlying mechanisms, optimal application techniques, and duration of use for this treatment modality. The study on the use of compression orthoses<xref rid=""bib0047"" ref-type=""bibr""><sup>47</sup></xref> had methodological deficiencies. These shortcomings include limited reporting of pain and instability outcomes, absence of follow-up data regarding baseline patient-reported outcome measures, and reliance solely on pre-post intervention data, which focused on strength. The authors<xref rid=""bib0047"" ref-type=""bibr""><sup>47</sup></xref> attribute the exclusion of baseline data from the 36-Item Short Form Survey Instrument, Health Assessment Questionnaire, and Fatigue Impact Scale because of the wide variation at baseline of the sample population and their utilization of compression orthoses before the study. Despite this, compression orthoses did yield small effect size for isokinetic mean power at 180°/s ER, suggesting a potential beneficial impact of the compression orthosis at the end range of movement, possibly through proprioceptive feedback.<xref rid=""bib0047"" ref-type=""bibr""><sup>47</sup></xref> This feedback may contribute to increased joint stability in end-range positions, where hypermobile joints typically exhibit diminished stability.<xref rid=""bib0062"" ref-type=""bibr""><sup>62</sup></xref> Despite the small effect sizes, these findings yield valuable insights into the use of compression in individuals with hEDS/HSD experiencing shoulder symptoms. Future research is required to explore the specific ranges of movement that individuals with hEDS/HSD require for optimal stability enhancements to facilitate functional abilities. Additionally, careful consideration should be given to determining the most effective approaches for addressing and improving these stability gains. To our knowledge, this is the first systematic review to evaluate the available literature regarding the effectiveness of conservative interventions in hEDS/HSD patients with shoulder symptoms. By consolidating the available research, we have attempted to enhance the understanding of conservative management for this patient population. The review includes 4 studies and suggests potential benefits from conservative management programs that integrate low-load and high-load strengthening regimes, KT, and compression orthoses. These findings highlight the effectiveness of strengthening exercises in improving function, reducing pain, and enhancing strength, although the necessity for supervision during these exercises remains a critical consideration with this patient population. However, significant knowledge gaps hinder optimal evidence-based application, with limited evidence evaluating the efficacy of KT and compression garments. As such, this review underscores the need for additional research with a focus on outcomes important to people living with hEDS/HSD, such as kinesiophobia and improving functional capabilities relevant to everyday life. It also highlights the need to develop a comprehensive treatment package for individuals with hEDS/HSD and shoulder symptoms.

Coexisting Sacroiliac Arthritis and Chronic Nonbacterial Osteomyelitis in an Adolescent with Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome: A Case Report and Treatment Success,"
Patient: Female, 15-year-old
 
Final Diagnosis: Chronic nonbacterial osteomyelitis • Ehlers-Danlos syndrome • sacroiliitis
 
Symptoms: Chronic pain • joint hypermobility
 
Clinical Procedure: Magnetic resonance imaging
 
Specialty: Pediatrics and Neonatology • Rheumatology
","Chronic nonbacterial osteomyelitis (CNO) is a very rare autoimmune disease occurring mainly in children and young adults [<xref rid=""b1-amjcaserep-25-e943579"" ref-type=""bibr"">1</xref>], with a female predominance [<xref rid=""b2-amjcaserep-25-e943579"" ref-type=""bibr"">2</xref>]. It manifests as osteoarticular pain, often at night, joint swelling, and pressure soreness [<xref rid=""b3-amjcaserep-25-e943579"" ref-type=""bibr"">3</xref>]. Additionally, general inflammatory symptoms such as fever, weakness, and weight loss may be present [<xref rid=""b4-amjcaserep-25-e943579"" ref-type=""bibr"">4</xref>]. Laboratory tests can reveal slight elevations in inflammatory parameters such as C-reactive protein (CRP) and leukocytes [<xref rid=""b5-amjcaserep-25-e943579"" ref-type=""bibr"">5</xref>]. Imaging studies such as X-rays, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and scintigraphy are mainly used in the diagnosis [<xref rid=""b6-amjcaserep-25-e943579"" ref-type=""bibr"">6</xref>]. Whole-body MRI is a key test in the CNO diagnosis and evaluation of the effectiveness of treatment [<xref rid=""b7-amjcaserep-25-e943579"" ref-type=""bibr"">7</xref>]. The disease should be differentiated from bacterial osteoarthritis, juvenile idiopathic arthritis, and malignant bone tumors [<xref rid=""b8-amjcaserep-25-e943579"" ref-type=""bibr"">8</xref>]. Therefore, in many patients, tissue biopsy should be considered as a method of definite distinction between malignant bone tumor and bone lesions associated with CNO [<xref rid=""b9-amjcaserep-25-e943579"" ref-type=""bibr"">9</xref>]. Sacroiliac arthritis is also a rare condition that occurs in children. The typical symptoms of sacroiliac joint involvement in adults, or back pain, are rarely reported in children and adolescents. MRI of the musculoskeletal system is the most sensitive test used to detect arthritis [<xref rid=""b10-amjcaserep-25-e943579"" ref-type=""bibr"">10</xref>]. Inflammatory lesions detected on MRI allow confident diagnosis in oligosymptomatic or asymptomatic cases [<xref rid=""b11-amjcaserep-25-e943579"" ref-type=""bibr"">11</xref>]. Ehlers-Danlos syndromes (EDS) is a heterogeneous group of hereditary connective tissue disorders, with the prevalence estimated to be between 1 in 5000 and 1 in 100 000. The syndrome manifests as excessive joint mobility, soft and hyperextensible skin, abnormal wound healing, and easy bruising [<xref rid=""b12-amjcaserep-25-e943579"" ref-type=""bibr"">12</xref>]. The international classification of EDS was published in 2017 proposing 13 different variants of EDS because of mutations in 19 genes [<xref rid=""b13-amjcaserep-25-e943579"" ref-type=""bibr"">13</xref>]. The main types are classical, vascular, hypermobile, arthrochalasis, kyphoscoliotic and classical, vascular, hypermobile, arthrochalasis, kyphoscoliotic, and dermatosparaxis, with the causative collagen pathology being different for each type. It is crucial to identify the specific type of EDS, particularly the vascular type, which may lead to potentially life-threatening consequences such as arterial rupture and organ perforation [<xref rid=""b14-amjcaserep-25-e943579"" ref-type=""bibr"">14</xref>]. EDS can be caused both by autosomal dominant or autosomal recessive inheritance patterns, depending on type. Most mutations are inherited, but there are several reports of spontaneous mutations resulting from identical genotypes and phenotypes [<xref rid=""b15-amjcaserep-25-e943579"" ref-type=""bibr"">15</xref>–<xref rid=""b18-amjcaserep-25-e943579"" ref-type=""bibr"">18</xref>]. As there is no specific treatment for patients with EDS, they must be consulted by a multidisciplinary healthcare team including cardiologists, orthopedists, rheumatologists, and geneticists, with the primary role of the family medicine provider, whose job is to coordinate management [<xref rid=""b15-amjcaserep-25-e943579"" ref-type=""bibr"">15</xref>]. Although the most common comorbidities in patients with EDS are gastrointestinal functional disorders, hernias, asthma, pneumonia, and osteoporosis [<xref rid=""b19-amjcaserep-25-e943579"" ref-type=""bibr"">19</xref>], there are indications that EDS could also increase the risks of multiple rheumatological conditions such as psoriasis, ankylosing spondylitis, rheumatoid arthritis, and fibromyalgia [<xref rid=""b20-amjcaserep-25-e943579"" ref-type=""bibr"">20</xref>]. In November 2022, a 17.5-year-old female patient was admitted to the Clinical Department of Pediatrics and Rheumatology at the St. Louis Regional Specialized Children’s Hospital in Cracow due to pain in the scapula, thoracic spine, shoulders, and iliac region. She was originally from in central Europe and was middle-class. Her symptoms had been present for 5 months, and were particularly severe in the morning. In addition, there was morning stiffness lasting up to about 1 hour. The was on long-term risedronate sodium acid 35 mg, methotrexate 20 mg, and folic acid 15 mg once a week and vitamin D3 2000 units a day. The patient’s past medical history was as follows. In June 2014, the 8-year-old patient was admitted to the Regional Children’s Hospital in Bydgoszcz due to post-traumatic right metatarsal bone fracture with presence of edema and pain. She was treated conservatively for 1 month, without clinical improvement. Therefore, it was decided to perform a computed tomography (CT) scan, which revealed an irregular osteolytic focus measuring 6×9 mm, with thinning of the cortical layer and contrast enhancement within the epiphysis of the meta-tarsal bone of the right hallux. In July 2014, she was referred to the Department of Orthopedics at the University Hospital in Bydgoszcz, where a planned partial excision of the tumor of the 1<sup>st</sup> and 2<sup>nd</sup> metatarsal bones of the right foot was performed. The histopathological result identified a metacarpal intraosseous lipoma. In October 2014, she developed left thigh pain of variable intensity, up to 7/10 on the Visual Analogue Scale (VAS), appeared mainly at night, waking her from sleep, and it subsided spontaneously. She underwent physical therapy (massage, laser therapy, cryotherapy), which brought short-term relief. On an outpatient basis, an X-ray of the left hip joint was performed, which did not reveal any abnormalities, while an ultrasound showed probable overload changes in the lateral aspect of the left thigh. In January 2015, she was admitted to the Department of Pediatrics, Hematology, and Oncology at the University Hospital in Bydgoszcz for further diagnostics. The laboratory tests revealed elevated CRP to 13.66 mg/L (reference value <10 mg/L). Physical examination found pain in the left thigh, restriction of internal rotation, and external rotation, as well as abduction and protrusion in the left hip joint, and positive Gaenslen’s test and Patrick’s test on the left side. MRI of the pelvis and hip joints was performed, revealing an ambiguous area within the left femur in the lower-lateral part of the neck, including the trochanter, and in the proximal part of the shaft at a length of about 115 mm, extending to the soft tissues around the altered bone. Re-hospitalization was recommended to differentiate the reported lesion, with consideration of a disseminated proliferative process, including lymphoma or inflammatory lesions in the course of systemic diseases. During hospitalization, palpable, non-painful, cohesive submandibular lymph nodes up to 15 mm in size were found. In laboratory tests, elevated CRP to 11.72 mg/L (reference value <10 mg/L), slight elevation of plasma immunoglobulin G (IgG) and immunoglobulin A (IgA) levels were noted. In the myelogram, single atypical cells, suggestive of cancer cells, were detected. An abdominal ultrasound showed enlargement of the spleen to 131 mm in length. The patient was discharged home with the recommendation to continue taking paracetamol on an interim basis. A week later, in mid-February 2015, a scintigraphy was performed, which described increased linear accumulation of radiopharmaceutical in the greater trochanter, in the medial margin of the subtrochanteric region of the left femur, focally in the projection of the sternoclavicular joints, the cranial segments of ribs IV–V, and in the projection of the shafts of the first and fifth metatarsal bones of the right foot. The image was described as ambiguous, and the examination did not differentiate the nature of the lesions between active proliferative and inflammatory processes. A week later, she was admitted to the Department of General and Oncologic Surgery for Children and Adolescents at the University Hospital in Bydgoszcz for a surgical biopsy of soft tissue and bone in the left thigh. The histopathological result identified dysplasia fibrosa ossis, with a component of chronic inflammatory exudate. In mid-April 2015, she was again admitted to the Department of Pediatrics, Hematology and Oncology at the University Hospital in Bydgoszcz and reported worsening pain involving the entire left lower limb and right knee. Physical examination revealed an abnormal gait, with limping on the left lower limb. The laboratory tests showed an elevation of CRP to 12.5 9 mg/L (reference value <10 mg/L) and in the proteinogram a slight elevation of total protein to 8.6 g/dL (reference value 6–8 g/dL). An X-ray of the left thigh was taken, which showed a greater thickening of the cortical layer than before, as well as a periosteal reaction in the lesser trochanter. The MRI of the lower limbs was also performed and compared with the MRI from January 2015. The examination showed partial regression of the extent and enhancement of hyperintense areas in the right hip joint acetabulum bone, sacrum of the S1 segment, in the L5 shaft, and a small focus in the left pubic bone shaft. Images of the remaining hyperintense lesions in the left femur and pelvic bones revealed no significant differences from the previous examination. Considering the clinical presentation and the results of laboratory and imaging findings, a suspicion of chronic nonbacterial osteomyelitis was raised. The patient was released home with the recommendation to take diclofenac 25 mg twice a day and cloxacin 500 mg once a day and was referred to the Orthopedic Outpatient Clinic of the University Children’s Hospital in Cracow for further diagnostics. The patient was readmitted to the Department of Pediatrics, Hematology and Oncology at the University Hospital in Bydgoszcz due to severe chest and epigastric pain, which occurred after 7 days of oral administration of diclofenac and cloxacin. The above medications were discontinued and treatment with a proton pump inhibitor was initiated, achieving complete resolution of the problems. Because of the suspicion of gastritis and family history (Leśniowski-Crohn’s disease in the father), gastroscopy and colonoscopy were performed. The histopathological result was inconclusive, and a diagnosis of non-infectious gastroenteritis and colitis was made. In June 2015, the diagnosis of CNO was confirmed at the Orthopedic Outpatient Clinic of the University Children’s Hospital in Cracow, and disodium pamidronate was started intravenously at a dose of 120 mg every 2 months. After 2 years, remission of the disease was achieved and pharmacotherapy was discontinued. In November 2018, a follow-up whole-body MRI was performed, which showed no inflammatory changes. In February 2019, the patient was referred to the Department of Pediatrics, Hematology, Oncology, and Rheumatology with spinal pain of severity 6/10 on the VAS scale, with no improvement after 2 weeks of diclofenac administration. Physical examination revealed significant painful limitation of spinal mobility in all planes, and she was unable to move her spine while prone. Treatment with naproxen was initiated and an urgent consultation at the Orthopedic Outpatient Clinic of the University Children’s Hospital in Cracow was recommended. In May 2019 at the Orthopedic Outpatient Clinic of the University Children’s Hospital in Cracow it was decided to reintroduce administration of disodium pamidronate intravenously at a dose of 180 mg. After 2 weeks, the pain subsided. A readmission to the department was scheduled 1 month later, during which a bone scintigraphy was performed, revealing no focal lesions. Another dose of 180 mg disodium pamidronate intravenously was administered in November 2019, achieving remission. In May 2020, the patient again reported to the Orthopedic Outpatient Clinic in Cracow due to recurrence of spinal pain in spite of treatment with analgesics. The performed skeletal scintigraphy revealed the accumulation of tracer in the posterior region of the left sixth rib, the corpus of the sternum, and the thoracic 5 to thoracic 8 (Th5-Th8) vertebrae. Due to an active inflammatory process in these locations, it was decided to introduce methotrexate therapy at a dose of 20 mg once a week and folic acid at a dose of 15 mg every 2 days after methotrexate. Treatment continued until January 2021, when the pain recurred again. The patient was referred to the Orthopedic Outpatient Clinic in Cracow with thoracic and lumbar spine pain of significant intensity, causing problems with standing up. Treatment was modified by adding sodium risedronate at a dose of 35 mg orally once a week, to the already-administered methotrexate with folic acid. At a follow-up visit in December 2021, the patient reported improvement in her general condition and was pain free. In May 2022, another bone scintigraphy was performed, in which tracer was concentrated in the corpus and manubrium of the sternum, Th5-Th8 vertebrae, and the right sacroiliac joint. Due to the suspicion of coexisting arthritis, the patient was referred to the Clinical Department of Pediatrics and Rheumatology at the St. Louis Regional Specialized Children’s Hospital in Cracow. Physical examination at the Clinical Department of Pediatrics and Rheumatology at the St. Louis Regional Specialized Children’s Hospital in Cracow revealed knee and elbow joint hyperextension, hypermobility of the phalanges, increased range of motion at the hip joints, with normal strength and muscle tone. Of note was the patient’s height of 182 cm, which was above the 100<sup>th</sup> percentile for age and the presence of reticular rash on the skin of the right side of the mandible. Her family history included a father under biological treatment for ankylosing spondylitis and coexisting Leśniowski-Crohn’s disease and a mother with a diagnosis of sarcoidosis. Blood laboratory tests performed during hospitalization revealed minor leukocytosis up to 10 550/μL (reference value 4190–9430/μL), normal CRP value <5 mg/L (reference value <10 mg/L), decrease in erythrocytes to 3 550 000/μL (reference value 4 100 000–5 100 000/μL), hemoglobin to 9.6 g/dL (reference value 10.8–13.3 g/dL), hematocrit to 28.7% (reference value 33.4–40.4%), and an increase in platelets to 366 000/μL (reference value 194 000–345 000/μL), with no other significant abnormalities. Her liver and kidney parameters were both normal: blood urea nitrogen 4.29 mmol/L (reference value 2.7–7 mmol/L), creatinine 63.55 μmol/L (reference value 40–69 μmol/L), aspartate aminotransferase 19 Units/L (reference value 15–45 U/L), and alanine aminotransferase 15 International Units/mL (reference value 10–40 IU/mL). In addition, she was negative for human leukocyte antigen B27 (HLA-B27) and human leukocyte antigen-Cw6 (HLA-Cw6). The flexibility of the joints, the presence of mandibular skin lesions, and difficult-to-heal scars from diagnostic biopsies (<xref rid=""f1-amjcaserep-25-e943579"" ref-type=""fig"">Figure 1</xref>) suggested Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome (EDS) classical type. The patient met 2 of the major criteria of classical EDS presented by Malfait et al in <italic toggle=""yes"">The 2017 international classification of the Ehlers-Danlos syndromes</italic> [<xref rid=""b16-amjcaserep-25-e943579"" ref-type=""bibr"">16</xref>], which were skin hyperextensibility and general joint hypermobility, and 3 minor criteria, which were soft, doughy skin, skin fragility, and the complications of joint hypermobility. Based on these clinical criteria, a diagnosis of EDS of the classical type was made. Accordingly, the patient was consulted by a cardiologist, who performed an electrocardiogram and a transthoracic echocardiogram, which did not reveal any pathologic findings. MRI of the thoracic spine showed a deepened kyphosis with right-sided thoracic curvature, as well as reduced height of the anterior parts of the Th5-Th7 vertebral bodies with irregularity of the end plates, fracture of the superior end plate of the Th3 vertebral body, intervertebral discs from Th2/Th3 to Th7/Th8 with reduced height, and features of dehydration. In addition, regions of bone marrow edema within the Th3, Th4, and Th7 vertebral bodies and the head of seventh rib on the left side confirmed inflammation of bones (<xref rid=""f2-amjcaserep-25-e943579"" ref-type=""fig"">Figure 2</xref>). A musculoskeletal system MRI was also performed, showing bilateral bone marrow edema in the sacrum and in the right iliac bone within the area adjacent to the sacroiliac joint (<xref rid=""f3-amjcaserep-25-e943579"" ref-type=""fig"">Figure 3</xref>), and areas corresponding to foci of adipose tissue metaplasia were visible in the same bones. The patient was diagnosed with active sacroiliac arthritis overlapping CNO, with the coexistence of EDS. She was released from the hospital with modified treatment: risedronate sodium 35 mg, methotrexate 20 mg, and folic acid 15 mg once a week, and vitamin D3 2000 units a day, with additional treatment of meloxicam 15 mg once a day and sulfasalazine 500 mg twice a day. At the follow-up visit at the Clinical Department of Pediatrics and Rheumatology at the St. Louis Regional Specialized Children’s Hospital in Cracow in December 2022, she reported no new concerns, and her medical condition had improved. Physical examination revealed a reticular rash on the skin of the right side of the mandible, on the skin of the thigh in the left ileal region, and on the dorsal surface of the right foot at the metatarsophalangeal border with healed per prima excisional scars. The joint contours were not enlarged, the knee and elbow joints were hyperextended, there was hypermobility of the phalanges and increased range of motion in the hip joints, while muscle strength and tension were normal. In results of blood laboratory tests performed during this hospitalization compared to the results before treatment modification showed leukocytes was decreased and within reference value at 6440/μL (reference value 4190–9430/μL), normal CRP value <5 mg/L (reference value <10 mg/L), erythrocytes increased to 3 830 000/μL (reference value 4 100 000–5 100 000/μL), hemoglobin to 9.9 g/dL (reference value 10.8–13.3 g/dL), hematocrit to 30.3% (reference value 33.4–40.4%), and platelets decreased to 346 000/μL (reference value 194 000–345 000/μL). Liver and kidney parameters remained normal: blood urea nitrogen was 4.08 mmol/L (reference value 2.7–7 mmol/L), creatinine was 63.3 μmol/L (reference value 40–69 μmol/L), aspartate aminotransferase was 23 U/L (reference value 15–45 U/L), and alanine aminotransferase was 21 IU/mL (reference value 10–40 IU/mL). An orthopedic consultation revealed remission of CNO and active bilateral sacroiliac arthritis. Therefore, it was decided to modify the treatment again. Bisphosphonate was discontinued, methotrexate was reduced to 15 mg once a week, folic acid was maintained at a dose of 15 mg once a week, vitamin D3 was increased to 4000 units a day, sulfasalazine was increased to 1 g twice a day, and etoricoxib was added at a dose of 60 mg once a day for 4 weeks. The patient was discharged from the hospital in good general condition with recommendations for follow-up at the Rheumatology and Orthopedic Clinics. CNO is a disease that is diagnosed based on the clinical presentation, imaging findings, and bone biopsy [<xref rid=""b21-amjcaserep-25-e943579"" ref-type=""bibr"">21</xref>]. Correct diagnosis is of great importance to avoid unnecessary surgery. For this reason, it was essential to perform a wide panel of tests, including invasive examinations, which resulted in the diagnosis of CNO in the presented case and allowed the patient to be provided with effective treatment. The primary management of a CNO patient is conservative treatment and mainly involves the administration of drugs such as disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs) and bisphosphonates [<xref rid=""b22-amjcaserep-25-e943579"" ref-type=""bibr"">22</xref>]. This standardized treatment targeted particularly at patients with active inflammatory lesions in the spine resulted in resolution of clinical symptoms of CNO in our patient. In this particular case, the confirmation of the CNO diagnosis required an entire year of different diagnostic procedures, including X-rays, CT scans, MRI, skeletal scintigraphy, and 2 invasive bone biopsies. It was challenging to differentiate CNO from the proliferative process that may have been present in the involved bones. The first treatment with an antibiotic initiated following the suspicion of CNO was inadequate and is not mentioned in the published CNO treatment strategies [<xref rid=""b23-amjcaserep-25-e943579"" ref-type=""bibr"">23</xref>]. However, the patient was referred to the Orthopedic Outpatient Clinic of the University Children’s Hospital in Cracow, which specializes in treatment of CNO and where appropriate therapy with bisphosphonates was instituted, resulting in remission. By managing the patient in a specialized orthopedic institution, it was possible to quickly react when the overlap of sacroiliac arthritis appeared and transfer the patient to the Rheumatology Department. CNO is one of the major causes of sacroiliitis in children [<xref rid=""b4-amjcaserep-25-e943579"" ref-type=""bibr"">4</xref>,<xref rid=""b24-amjcaserep-25-e943579"" ref-type=""bibr"">24</xref>,<xref rid=""b25-amjcaserep-25-e943579"" ref-type=""bibr"">25</xref>]. The present case illustrates the importance of cooperation between physicians of various specializations, which is particularly important in management of patients with rare diseases, who usually require multidisciplinary consultations. MRI is essential for the diagnosis of sacroiliac arthritis [<xref rid=""b26-amjcaserep-25-e943579"" ref-type=""bibr"">26</xref>–<xref rid=""b28-amjcaserep-25-e943579"" ref-type=""bibr"">28</xref>], and in our patient revealed inflammatory lesions despite no significant elevation of inflammatory markers in laboratory tests. This highlights the importance of MRI in the early diagnosis of sacroiliac arthritis, which allowed the immediate addition of meloxicam and sulfasalazine to the existing treatment [<xref rid=""b29-amjcaserep-25-e943579"" ref-type=""bibr"">29</xref>]. As a result, resolution of symptoms was achieved. In addition, an increase in erythrocyte count and hemoglobin was obtained; therefore, it was decided that the patient did not require further hematological consultation. The prognosis of patients with CNO and an extraosseous manifestation such as sacroiliitis is worse than in patients with bone-limited CNO and may require escalation of therapy to DMARDs and biologic agents [<xref rid=""b25-amjcaserep-25-e943579"" ref-type=""bibr"">25</xref>,<xref rid=""b30-amjcaserep-25-e943579"" ref-type=""bibr"">30</xref>], as in our patient. Another point of interest in this case is that despite the patient’s numerous hospitalizations, the symptoms of hypermobility, the presence of reticular rash on the skin of the mandible, and difficult-to-heal scars from diagnostic biopsies were not noticed until 2022, when the 17.5-year-old patient was hospitalized in our department. It is not known when the above symptoms first appeared. In addition, the patient developed gastritis and colitis after oral antibiotic and diclofenac treatment, which may also be related to a proven predisposition to gastrointestinal diseases in patients with EDS [<xref rid=""b31-amjcaserep-25-e943579"" ref-type=""bibr"">31</xref>–<xref rid=""b33-amjcaserep-25-e943579"" ref-type=""bibr"">33</xref>] and CNO [<xref rid=""b25-amjcaserep-25-e943579"" ref-type=""bibr"">25</xref>]. According to the literature, the diagnosis of EDS is made an average of 14 years after the appearance of the first clinical manifestations [<xref rid=""b34-amjcaserep-25-e943579"" ref-type=""bibr"">34</xref>]. This may be related to the common physicians’ perception of EDS as a rare disease. However, it is essential to quickly establish an appropriate diagnosis to prevent later complications, such as through appropriate pain management, physical therapy [<xref rid=""b35-amjcaserep-25-e943579"" ref-type=""bibr"">35</xref>], and patients’ self-management [<xref rid=""b36-amjcaserep-25-e943579"" ref-type=""bibr"">36</xref>]. In the presented case, the diagnosis of EDS did not change the treatment, as the patient had already received multiple medications due to previously diagnosed rheumatic diseases, which were sufficient to deal with her condition. Each patient with coexisting inflammatory diseases, sacroiliac arthritis, and CNO with genetic diseases poses a diagnostic challenge. These diseases have similar clinical manifestations [<xref rid=""b37-amjcaserep-25-e943579"" ref-type=""bibr"">37</xref>]; therefore, it is crucial to constantly observe such patients and detect any new, often untypical symptoms emerging. There are a few case reports in the literature of patients with a CNO diagnosis and coexisting sacroiliitis [<xref rid=""b38-amjcaserep-25-e943579"" ref-type=""bibr"">38</xref>,<xref rid=""b39-amjcaserep-25-e943579"" ref-type=""bibr"">39</xref>]. There are also data in the literature on the co-occurrence of EDS and CNO [<xref rid=""b40-amjcaserep-25-e943579"" ref-type=""bibr"">40</xref>], and there is little evidence that EDS is associated with complicated rheumatological conditions [<xref rid=""b20-amjcaserep-25-e943579"" ref-type=""bibr"">20</xref>]. The coexistence of these 3 diseases in the same patient has not been previously reported. The co-occurrence of CNO, sacroiliac arthritis, and EDS is very rare and requires extensive investigations. Imaging examinations such as MRI of the musculoskeletal system and bone scintigraphy are particularly important in CNO and sacroiliac arthritis; however, in certain cases, a bone biopsy is needed to exclude proliferative diseases. Increased attention should be paid to patients with joint hypermobility, as EDS is often diagnosed several years after the first symptoms appeared. The multi-speciality therapeutic management of patients with complicated medical histories is essential to provide an appropriate diagnosis and initiate suitable treatment to achieve remission.",N/A,2024
Functional benefit of joint surgery in patients with non-vascular Ehlers-Danlos syndrome: results of a retrospective study,,"Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (EDS) is a spectrum of heterogeneous genetic diseases caused by anomalies in the biosynthesis or structure of proteins integral to the extracellular matrix resulting in joint hypermobility, skin hyperextensibility and tissue fragility [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR1"">1</xref>–<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR3"">3</xref>]. The disease has an estimated prevalence of 1/5000 live births and can affect males and females of all racial groups and ethnicities [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR3"">3</xref>]. In 2017, the international classification of EDS described 13 different subtypes, of which 12 have a recognised associated genetic mutation [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR4"">4</xref>]. A rare 14th subtype was described by Blackburn et al. in 2018 [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR5"">5</xref>]. The majority of patients with EDS (80‒95%) are diagnosed with the hypermobile subtype (hEDS) [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR6"">6</xref>], but this is the only subtype without an identified genetic cause [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR1"">1</xref>]. EDS is characterised by musculoskeletal complications linked to joint instability and hypermobility. These include subluxations, dislocations, sprains, soft tissue lesions, and later complications such as tendonitis, tendon ruptures, muscle and ligament tears, muscle tension and spasms, osteoarthritis and chronic joint pain [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR7"">7</xref>]. Patients with EDS are also more likely to suffer from cutaneous manifestations such as skin hyperextensibility and skin fragility [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR7"">7</xref>]. In addition to joint hypermobility and skin problems, patients with EDS may experience gynaecological, ocular, oral, cardiovascular, gastrointestinal and neurological problems [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR7"">7</xref>], fatigue and chronic pain [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR8"">8</xref>, <xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR9"">9</xref>]. The diagnosis of EDS is based on clinical criteria [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR4"">4</xref>] and is confirmed by molecular biology for all EDS subtypes except hEDS. The diagnosis of hEDS depends on the simultaneous presence of three criteria: (i) generalised joint hypermobility: a Beighton score ≥ 5 (adjusted according to age); (ii) the presence of systemic manifestations of a generalised connective tissue disorder and/or positive family history, with one or more first-degree relatives independently meeting the current diagnostic criteria for hEDS, and/or musculoskeletal complications; and (iii) the exclusion of other types of EDS or alternative diagnoses [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR4"">4</xref>]. Hypermobile EDS appears to be autosomal dominant in transmission and predominantly affects females [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR10"">10</xref>]. There is no cure for EDS and current approaches to treatment include physical therapy to improve joint stability, orthoses or compression garments, pain relief, appropriate treatments for other symptoms and psychological counselling [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR11"">11</xref>]. Surgical treatment may be an option in specific patients after failure of medical treatments, particularly procedures for joint instability or nerve decompression. In 2020, Hoemere et al. reported the results of surgical procedures on the shoulder or knee in patients with hEDS/joint hypermobility syndrome (JHS) [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR12"">12</xref>] and concluded that surgical management of shoulder or knee instability in these patients is challenging, probably due to the inferior biomechanical properties of the connective tissue. To date, there has been no consensus on the optimal surgical management of patients with EDS. The aim of the current study was to chart the surgical management of patients with non-vascular EDS, to determine the place of arthroscopy and to evaluate the functional results of surgery, including the reintervention rate.   This is the first descriptive study of the results of surgery in patients with non-vascular EDS. It is also the largest series of patients with a confirmed diagnosis of EDS and known functional scores undergoing orthopaedic surgery. Our results show that surgery for joint instability has a greater chance of success when it is carried out in patients where the diagnosis of EDS is known preoperatively. Postoperatively, there was a high rate of dislocations in these patients (72.7%), but a low rate of reoperations, with the majority of patients (> 70%) being satisfied with their surgery. In addition, our study also demonstrates that arthroscopic procedures have an important role to play in these patients, particularly when surgery is performed on the knee. To date, a major part of the literature regarding joint instability in non-vascular EDS consists of case reports or technical notes, mainly concerning the shoulder or knee. Stanitski et al. described the orthopaedic manifestations of EDS and their functional impact without analysing the specific effects of surgery in patients with EDS [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR14"">14</xref>]. In a recent study, shoulder arthroplasty (SA) in patients with EDS was a viable option and gave similar results to SA in patients with osteoarthritis or cuff tear arthropathy in terms of postoperative pain, range of motion, complications and reoperations [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR15"">15</xref>]. For Tibbo et al. the improvement in function of patients with EDS after primary total knee arthroplasty (TKA) was similar to that of patients undergoing TKA for osteoarthritis, with no significant difference in reoperation or revision rates between the two groups (<italic toggle=""yes"">p</italic> < 0.05) [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR16"">16</xref>]. Regarding total hip arthroplasty (THA), Guier et al. showed a significant improvement in postoperative Harris Hip Scores after THA in patients with EDS, but these patients had a high rate of dislocation after surgery [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR17"">17</xref>]. A high rate of dislocation after THA and worse implant survival at 5-years was also reported in patients with EDS by Moore et al. [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR18"">18</xref>]. In our survey, surgical intervention was uncommon in patients with EDS (only 236 patients underwent surgery out of 1368 (17.3%) followed in the reference centre). Furthermore, only 75 (31.8%) of the 236 patients undergoing surgery had a diagnosis of EDS according to the new 2017 EDS criteria (Fig. <xref rid=""Fig1"" ref-type=""fig"">1</xref>). A preoperative diagnosis of EDS was known for only 22% of patients undergoing surgery on the knee or elbow whereas this figure was 59% for patients undergoing shoulder surgery. The benefit of surgery appears to be maximal in patients where instability is linked to a preoperative diagnosis of EDS and the failure of joint surgery in a young person with EDS should suggest a diagnosis of EDS. In the general population, instability of the shoulder is classically treated surgically by coracoid bone block or a Bankart repair depending on the background of the patient (age, sporting activity) and assessment of the lesions by imaging. In patients with non-vascular EDS, the shoulder should be treated initially with specific physical therapy exercises, focussing on dynamic kinetics, resting rotator cuff tone and scapulothoracic mechanics, before resorting to surgery [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR19"">19</xref>]. In our series, nine shoulders required two or more reinterventions (40.9%). Out of the four initial Bankart repairs, one shoulder was reoperated on multiple times for a bone block procedure, which ultimately failed. No article in the literature has addressed the results of a Bankart repair in patients with EDS and most articles describe case reports or surgical techniques only [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR19"">19</xref>]. In a series of 15 patients (20 shoulders), including five with EDS and 10 with hyperlaxity syndromes without a genetic diagnosis, Dewing et al. demonstrated the interest of anterior capsule-labral reconstruction for recurrent shoulder instability with an improvement in functional scores and the absence of repeat dislocation in 45% of cases at 3.8 years [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR20"">20</xref>]. In another study of five shoulders (four patients) with EDS, open capsular shift combined with Achilles allograft augmentation of the anterior capsule restored shoulder stability in 4/5 (80%) shoulders and decreased pain (VAS: 7 preoperative vs. 2 at last follow-up), with only one case of revision surgery for recurrent posterior shoulder instability after an injury 1.6 years after the initial surgery [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR21"">21</xref>]. Despite the high risk of complications, shoulder surgery can be proposed in patients with non-vascular EDS, including a coracoid bone block procedure, (known as Latarjet) after failure of medical therapy, in particular on the non-dominant shoulder where the best results are expected. Although we observed a higher risk of recurrence of shoulder dislocation postoperatively in patients with non-vascular EDS than in the general population (72.7% in this series vs. < 5% in the general population), the rate of reinterventions for dislocation after a primary Latarjet procedure was 2.7% (<italic toggle=""yes"">n</italic> = 3/11) in this study vs. 1.6% in the literature [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR22"">22</xref>]. The knee was the joint that most frequently required more than one intervention (30/50; 60% of knees) (Table <xref rid=""Tab2"" ref-type=""table"">2</xref>). Patellar instability was the most frequent cause of primary knee surgery (62%). However, it was also the primary cause of reinterventions (60% of cases; <italic toggle=""yes"">n</italic> = 30/50) for failure of stabilisation or ablation of material. Reconstruction of the medial patellofemoral ligament has mainly been studied in patients with JHS. These patients are improved by this type of patellar stabilisation, but the functional result is less satisfactory than in the general population [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR23"">23</xref>]. In this series of 25 patients with hypermobility defined according to Beighton criteria, patellar stabilisation by reconstruction of the medial patellofemoral ligament resulted in a significant improvement of function, but this was significantly less than in control patients (<italic toggle=""yes"">p</italic> < 0.01). The authors concluded that joint hypermobility is not a contraindication to reconstruction of the medial patellofemoral ligament, but the expectations of patients with hypermobility should be managed carefully before considering surgery [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR23"">23</xref>]. In our opinion, this surgical solution does not appear to be an option for the treatment of patellar instability in patients with non-vascular EDS. No other study has reported the results of anterior tibial tuberosity transfer in this population. Questions on the nature of the graft to be used for anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) repair have been raised in patients with tissue fragility. To our knowledge, there is no consensus on the choice of graft and the use of allografts has not been demonstrated specifically. Good results have been reported with ACL reconstruction for patellar instability in patients with hypermobility and EDS [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR24"">24</xref>–<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR27"">27</xref>]. In our series, reconstruction was most often performed using modifications of the technique originally described by Dr Kenneth Jones [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR28"">28</xref>] and no repeat ligamentoplasties were necessary. The ligamentoplasties performed in patients undergoing two or more operations were carried out after an initial meniscal procedure for patellar stabilisation. In patients with JHS, reconstruction of the ACL using a bone-tendon-bone graft gave the best results in terms of residual laxity and functional score compared to ligamentoplasty using the hamstrings [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR27"">27</xref>]. By extrapolation, and in light of our results, reconstruction of the ACL using the Kenneth Jones technique appears to be good option in patients with hEDS. In the current series, surgery to the elbow was usually secondary to fractures or due to ulnar nerve instability. Overall, joint instability was not a cause for surgery. Granata et al. demonstrated a high prevalence of ulnar nerve instability of the elbow in patients with hSED [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR29"">29</xref>]. There are two hypotheses for this: (i) an increased frequency of peripheral neuropathies [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR30"">30</xref>]; and (ii) anatomic variation of the Osborne ligament, which is looser in patients with hEDS [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR31"">31</xref>]. In terms of residual pain, DASH score and patient satisfaction, endoscopic decompression has been shown to give similar results to decompression with anterior transposition in idiopathic cubital tunnel syndrome [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR32"">32</xref>]. In our series, all patients underwent nerve transposition by open surgery although endoscopic-assisted subfascial anterior transposition of the ulnar nerve has been reported to be a more refined technique with good functional outcomes [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR33"">33</xref>]. Patients with EDS often present with coagulation problems and low body weight due to gastrointestinal and eating problems [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR34"">34</xref>, <xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR35"">35</xref>]. In a comparative study of open versus endoscopic cubital tunnel release, Buchanan et al. reported equivalent overall clinical improvement after the two types of procedure, but patients in the endoscopic group had a significantly higher incidence of postoperative haematoma (OR = 5.70 [95%CI: 1.2–27.03; <italic toggle=""yes"">p</italic> = 0.03) [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR36"">36</xref>]. Therefore, extra care should be taken in patients with hEDS due to the increased risk of haematoma in this group and the theoretical contraindications to cubital tunnel release in underweight patients [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR36"">36</xref>]. Finally, there was a low reoperation rate on the elbow of 44.4% (4/9 elbows). In the current series, wrist surgery was usually carried out for scapholunate instability or pathologies associated with the distal radioulnar joint. The high number of palliative surgeries (represented by wrist arthrodesis) suggests that surgical management of these instabilities is difficult. No parallel study is available in the literature and only case reports have been published. The use of allografts for ligamentoplasty has been reported for instability of the extensor carpi ulnaris with good results [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR37"">37</xref>]. The rate of reinterventions on the wrist in the present study was 50%. Surgery was performed on the ankle in 28 cases. Ligamentoplasty was the most frequent procedure performed. This was also the leading cause of reoperations, which occurred in 35.7% of cases (10/28). One of the reasons for this is probably graft failure due to the poor quality of the tissues. In these cases, it would probably be more beneficial to use an allograft. No recommendations are available regarding the surgical management of chronic ankle instability in patients with non-vascular EDS. The management of anaesthesia may be difficult in these patients. In our survey, 42% experienced problems with GA and 47% were insensitive to LRA. These results are consistent with data in the literature, which describe resistance to local anaesthetics, in particular lidocaine and bupivacaine [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR38"">38</xref>]. To date, the current study is the largest survey specific to patients with hEDS and sheds light on the types of joint surgery performed in these patients. However, it has some limitations. It was retrospective in nature and the collection of data by video-consultation may have been responsible for inaccuracies in responses relating to surgical and anaesthesia histories. Furthermore, the absence of preoperative functional scores means that we could not evaluate any gains achieved postoperatively. Finally, a comparison with other patient populations without EDS would have helped to define the benefits or pitfalls of specific surgical procedures. In conclusion, surgery for joint instability has the greatest chance of success when it is carried out in patients with an established diagnosis of EDS. It should be proposed after medical therapies have failed, including orthoses, compression garments and physical therapy. Patient management should take place within a specialist multidisciplinary team. Compared to the high relapse rate of shoulder dislocations (72.7%), the reintervention rates were low (35.7–60%) and the majority of patients (> 70%) were satisfied or very satisfied with their surgery. Although surgery has historically been avoided in patients with EDS and the rates of surgery remain low (17.3% in our cohort), surgical procedures may be beneficial in patients with non-vascular EDS and should be proposed with the aim of reducing pain and improving quality of life. Arthroscopy has an important role to play, particularly in knee surgery, and future case–control studies will be useful to confirm the benefit of arthroscopic procedures in non-vascular EDS patients.",N/A,23 9 2024
Dynamically rebalancing the unstable shoulder in Ehlers-Danlos syndrome: latissimus dorsi transfer for posterior shoulder instability,," hEDS is a common subtype of EDS, characterized by more than 95% of patients experiencing frequent instability across all joints, often requiring surgical management.<xref rid=""bib12"" ref-type=""bibr""><sup>12</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid=""bib47"" ref-type=""bibr""><sup>47</sup></xref> The reliance on dynamic and static soft tissue stabilizers without the bony stability within the glenohumeral joint leaves patients at risk of posterior dislocation and subluxation, especially in hEDS.<xref rid=""bib12"" ref-type=""bibr""><sup>12</sup></xref> When primary arthroscopic stabilization procedures fail to maintain shoulder stability, bone block procedures, arthroplasty, and arthrodesis are potential salvage procedures.<xref rid=""bib5"" ref-type=""bibr""><sup>5</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid=""bib12"" ref-type=""bibr""><sup>12</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid=""bib22"" ref-type=""bibr""><sup>22</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid=""bib42"" ref-type=""bibr""><sup>42</sup></xref> In this particular case, the patient exhibited recalcitrant shoulder instability after she underwent multiple failed stabilization procedures, including 2 arthroscopic capsulorrhaphies, a capsular plication, and a rotator interval closure.

Thus, we suspect an LD release alone would not be enough given the significant capsular laxity with the posterior soft tissue envelope. Patients with hEDS experience various forms of scapular dyskinesia, driven by PM overactivity and voluntary or involuntary contractions of other periscapular muscles.<xref rid=""bib52"" ref-type=""bibr""><sup>52</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid=""bib53"" ref-type=""bibr""><sup>53</sup></xref> The scapular dyskinesia usually begins as the body’s attempt to compensate for the shoulder instability, but only serves to worsen the instability itself.<xref rid=""bib12"" ref-type=""bibr""><sup>12</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid=""bib44"" ref-type=""bibr""><sup>44</sup></xref> For example, scapular protraction and dyskinesia during attempted motion can lead to what appears like posterior glenohumeral instability.

As described in this case, the arthroscopically assisted posterior transfer of the LD tendon to the lateral GT turns it into an external rotator, providing improved shoulder stability through an anterior-directed force. This dynamic solution to shoulder instability is similar to the concept of the Latarjet for anterior shoulder instability, where the coracoid process is transferred to the glenoid.<xref rid=""bib9"" ref-type=""bibr""><sup>9</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid=""bib27"" ref-type=""bibr""><sup>27</sup></xref> Furthermore, the release of the PM helps to correct the scapular dyskinesia driving the posterior instability.

Multiple dermatofibromas in a patient with Ehlers–Danlos syndrome: a case report,,"Ehlers–Danlos syndromes (EDS) comprise a group of relatively rare heritable connective tissue disorders characterized by defects in collagen synthesis or processing. These disorders are associated with a constellation of clinical manifestations, which may include skin hyperextensibility, joint hypermobility, and tissue fragility. The estimated overall prevalence of EDS is ~1 in 5000 individuals and encompass a spectrum of discrete disorders, with 13 recognized subtypes to date, each with its own clinical manifestations and diagnostic criteria. Among these subtypes, the underlying genetic alterations have been elucidated for 12 of these conditions, providing valuable insights into their molecular basis. Hypermobile Ehlers–Danlos syndrome (hEDS) is the most common type, but its genetic basis remains unknown, which makes diagnosis challenging since it relies on clinical evaluation [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR1"">1</xref>, <xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR2"">2</xref>]. The correct clinical diagnosis of EDS can be established based on family history and clinical criteria, including the degree and nature of involvement of the skin, joints, and blood vessel walls [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR3"">3</xref>]. The most common cutaneous manifestations are hyperextensibility, fragility, smooth, velvety skin that bruises easily, delayed wound healing, and thin, atrophic scars after wound healing [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR2"">2</xref>]. The Beighton score is the most common method used for evaluating generalized joint hypermobility in hEDS [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR1"">1</xref>]. Dermatofibromas, also called benign fibrous histiocytomas, are among the most common cutaneous soft-tissue lesions. They represent a benign dermal proliferation of fibroblasts that can arise as a reactive process following various triggers, such as trauma, injections, arthropod bites, or ruptured folliculitis, but often are idiopathic [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR4"">4</xref>]. Dermatofibromas typically present as firm, often hyperpigmented, nodules 0.3–1.0 cm in diameter, but giant lesions larger than 3 cm in diameter have been described [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR5"">5</xref>, <xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR6"">6</xref>]. Diagnosis is usually based on clinical appearance and histopathology. Multiple clustered dermatofibroma (MCDF) is a distinct variant of multiple dermatofibromas and is defined as a well-demarcated plaque composed of individual dermatofibromas [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR7"">7</xref>]. Previous studies have explored potential links between EDS and various other conditions, including urinary incontinence. While multiple dermatofibromas have been associated with certain systemic diseases, with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) being the most prominent, followed by human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR8"">8</xref>, <xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR9"">9</xref>], this presentation has not been previously reported alongside EDS. Our case report describes a patient with a confirmed diagnosis of EDS who also exhibited multiple dermatofibromas. An 18-year-old Iranian woman presented to the al-Zahra Hospital Dermatology Clinic with the chief complaint of multiple purple nodules that appeared about 2 years ago after trauma and fracture of her left elbow, on the proximal lower limb. The patient did not have a previous diagnosis, and it was her first consultation for these lesions. On physical examination, purple nodules with diameters ranging from 0.5 cm to 1.5 cm, which were mobile, were observed on the proximal part of the lower limb. The dimple sign of these lesions was positive (Fig. <xref rid=""Fig1"" ref-type=""fig"">1</xref>). Upon inspection, an abnormal shape of the fingers was visible, and during the examination of her whole body to detect any other signs and symptoms, we noted that the skin was hyperextensible and fragile, and wide atrophic scars were evident on the upper limb. Joints displayed hypermobility, especially in the fingers, and Swan-neck deformities of the digits were also apparent (Fig. <xref rid=""Fig2"" ref-type=""fig"">2</xref>). Some nodules were observed on her knee, and striae alba were present on her leg (Fig. <xref rid=""Fig3"" ref-type=""fig"">3</xref>). Skin-colored papules on the sides of the heel (piezogenic papules) were also seen, all of which are consistent with EDS.<fig id=""Fig1""><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>Purple nodules with diameter of 0.5–1.5 cm, which are mobile have been seen on the proximal part of the lower limb</p></caption><graphic http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink href=""13256_2024_4628_Fig1_HTML"" id=""MO1""></graphic></fig><fig id=""Fig2""><label>Fig. 2</label><caption><p><bold>A</bold> Hypermobile finger. <bold>B</bold> Swan-neck deformity of the digi</p></caption><graphic http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink href=""13256_2024_4628_Fig2_HTML"" id=""MO2""></graphic></fig><fig id=""Fig3""><label>Fig. 3</label><caption><p><bold>A</bold> Atrophic scar on the elbow. <bold>B</bold> Striae alba on legs</p></caption><graphic http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink href=""13256_2024_4628_Fig3_HTML"" id=""MO3""></graphic></fig> The patient was the first child in her family, and her birth weight was 3.1 kg. She had normal growth and development during the fetal period. EDS symptoms appeared at the time of puberty as skin hyperextensibility, joint hypermobility, brittle skin, and susceptibility to ecchymosis. She mentioned a history of xerosis and atopic dermatitis since her infancy. She also had a history of respiratory disorders and had been diagnosed with asthma about 5 years ago, and inhalation corticosteroids had been prescribed for her for 2 years. She did not mention any history of cardiovascular, ophthalmic, skeletal, or gastrointestinal disorders. Family history was negative. A biopsy of the nodular lesions was performed and showed fibrohistiocytic proliferation, acanthotic epidermis, and elongated rete ridges, which were suggestive of dermatofibroma (Fig. <xref rid=""Fig4"" ref-type=""fig"">4</xref>A, B). The patient was referred to a cardiologist and ophthalmologist. The result of the echocardiography was normal, and no abnormalities in the eyes were observed. Unfortunately, the patient was not cooperative for further diagnostic studies and abstained from genetic testing and any other diagnostic assessments. Clinical diagnosis of classical EDS was established based on physical examination findings that met two major criteria (skin hyperextensibility, atrophic scarring, and generalized joint hypermobility) and two minor criteria (easy bruising and skin fragility). We also ruled out other connective tissue disorders that are included in the differential diagnosis of EDS. Finally, we educated the patient about both the benign nature of the dermatofibroma lesions and the importance of EDS follow-up.<fig id=""Fig4""><label>Fig. 4</label><caption><p>There are papilomatous and acanthotic epidermis with basal layer pigmentation. In dermis, grenz zone and admixture of fibroblasts, histocytes, and blood vessels are seen</p></caption><graphic http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink href=""13256_2024_4628_Fig4_HTML"" id=""MO4""></graphic></fig> Dermatofibroma, also known as benign fibrous histiocytomas, are common, benign, painless dermal nodules that are usually solitary and measure less than 1 cm. They often appear on the extremities of middle-aged women [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR10"">10</xref>]. The pathogenesis of dermatofibromas is not fully understood. Histopathologically, dermatofibromas are caused by persistent inflammatory proliferation of either histiocytes, fibroblasts, or dermal dendritic cells. Some dermatofibromas clearly arise as a reactive process following traumas, injections, arthropod’s bites, or ruptured folliculitis [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR4"">4</xref>]. Also, in literature, there are reports of multiple dermatofibroma that suggesting association with some diseases including systemic lupus erythematosus as most dominant and then HIV infection. The study that reported multiple dermatofibromas with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection in three men suggests immunosuppression as the basic mechanism for incidence of multiple dermatofibromas [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR9"">9</xref>]. There are examples of patients who developed dermatofibromas while taking oral prednisone (with SLE) or occurrence of new dermatofibromas related to increase in corticosteroid dosage and a dramatic reduction in the number of dermatofibromas when corticosteroid treatment was discontinued. This indicates that immunosuppressive therapies also may play a role in the pathogenesis of dermatofibroma [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR4"">4</xref>, <xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR10"">10</xref>, <xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR11"">11</xref>]. In addition, some other conditions in comorbidities with multiple dermatofibromas have been reported including dermatomyositis, Sézary syndrome, hepatitis C, hepatocellular carcinoma, Hashimoto’s thyroiditis, myasthenia gravis, chronic myeloid leukemia, and Sjögren’s syndrome, and recently, a survey was published that showed new onset of multiple dermatofibromas in site of the shunt area after renal transplantation in patients [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR12"">12</xref>–<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR20"">20</xref>]. Our patient was diagnosed with asthma 5 years ago and used an inhaled corticosteroid for 2 years. The lesions developed 1 year after withdrawing the inhaled corticosteroid. Considering the lack of systemic effects and the 1-year gap, we believe the inhaled corticosteroid is unlikely to be a factor in the development of multiple dermatofibromas (MD). Regarding the left elbow trauma and fracture, despite the initial suspicion, the different anatomical locations and the presence of multiple lesions make the association questionable. Ehlers–Danlos syndromes are a group of inherited connective tissue disorders that can exhibit either an autosomal dominant or autosomal recessive inheritance pattern. These disorders frequently result from genetic alterations in genes responsible for encoding collagen proteins or enzymes involved in the modification of collagen [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR1"">1</xref>]. In 2017, the International Classification of Ehlers–Danlos syndromes (EDS) underwent a revision, resulting in the delineation of 13 unique subtypes, with EDS hypermobility type being by far the most common and some types being quite rare. This updated classification system was based on a comprehensive analysis of the phenotypic features and the corresponding molecular pathogenesis associated with each subtype. The molecular basis is known in all subtypes except for hypermobile EDS [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR1"">1</xref>, <xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR2"">2</xref>, <xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR21"">21</xref>]. Nevertheless, genetic testing is not performed for every patient, and the 2017 diagnostic criteria do not provide explicit guidance on the recommended scope of genetic analysis [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR1"">1</xref>]. There are diagnostic criteria for hypermobile Ehlers–Danlos syndrome (hEDS) provided by International Consortium on Ehlers–Danlos Syndromes and Related Disorders with the Beighton score used for assessing joint hypermobility in patients with EDS. A revised clinical criterion for hypermobile EDS and set of diagnostic clinical criteria for all of EDS subtypes are also proposed by Malfait <italic toggle=""yes"">et al</italic>. in 2017. Based on revised diagnostic clinical criteria for EDS, a patient must meet specific criteria for a suggestive diagnosis of classical Ehlers–Danlos Syndrome (cEDS). Firstly, the patient must exhibit the major criterion of skin hyperextensibility and atrophic scarring. In addition to this major criterion, the patient must also have either the second major criterion, generalized joint hypermobility, and/or at least three minor criteria including easy bruising, soft, doughy skin, skin fragility, molluscoid pseudotumors, subcutaneous spheroids, hernia, epicanthal folds, complications of joint hypermobility, and family history of a first-degree relative who meets clinical criteria [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR1"">1</xref>]. In our case, since the patient was not sufficiently cooperative, we were unable to perform genetic testing for EDS. We established a clinical diagnosis of EDS, with a high suspicion of the classical type, based on physical examination findings that met two major criteria (skin hyperextensibility, atrophic scarring, and generalized joint hypermobility) and two minor criteria (easy bruising and skin fragility). The absence of multiple fractures, short stature, and bluish sclerae in infancy are distinguishing features of osteogenesis imperfecta [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR22"">22</xref>, <xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR23"">23</xref>]. In patients with Marfan syndrome (MFS), disorders of the cardiovascular system, musculoskeletal system, and eyes, as well as tall stature, are common symptoms. In our case, the lack of lens abnormalities confirmed by slit-lamp examination, a normal echocardiography report, and normal stature helped us exclude MFS [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR24"">24</xref>]. Cutis laxa is characterized by an absence of skin elasticity, leading to loose and sagging skin. Unlike in EDS, when tension is applied to and then released from the skin of patients with cutis laxa, it does not return to its original position due to the loss of elastin [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR25"">25</xref>, <xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR26"">26</xref>]. Other disorders that can closely mimic EDS in clinical presentation, such as Loeys–Dietz syndrome, arterial tortuosity syndrome, lateral meningocele syndrome, tenascin-X deficiency, Stickler syndrome, Ullrich congenital muscular dystrophy, and occipital horn syndrome (OHS), did not match the clinical manifestations observed in our case [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR27"">27</xref>]. A comprehensive search of relevant databases, including Embase, Medline, Web of Science, and Google Scholar, revealed no prior reports of patients with both Ehlers–Danlos Syndrome (EDS) and multiple dermatofibromas. While a causal relationship between multiple dermatofibromas and EDS cannot be definitively established based on our single case observation, this unusual clinical presentation highlights the need for continued observation and reporting of such cases.",N/A,31 8 2024

</xref> Here, we report a case of intra‐abdominal hemorrhage due to a ruptured aneurysm of a region of the celiac artery, which was diagnosed as vascular EDS because of a history of sigmoid colon perforation. A 25‐year‐old Japanese man was admitted to a nearby hospital for acute abdominal pain of unknown cause. He experienced repeated relief and aggravation of symptoms after the analgesic administration. On day 9 of hospitalization, the patient went into hemorrhagic shock. Enhanced abdominal computed tomography (CT) revealed severe intraabdominal bleeding. The patient was transferred to an emergency medical center. On admission, he was conscious; however, blood pressure was 100/72 mmHg; heart rate, 124 beats/min; and respiratory rate, 30 breaths/min, indicating shock. Tenderness was observed throughout the abdomen with guarding. The patient underwent a laparotomy for sigmoid colon perforation 12 years ago. Contrast‐enhanced CT of the abdomen on admission to the ER (Figure <xref rid=""ams2984-fig-0001"" ref-type=""fig"">1</xref>) revealed hematogenous ascites on the liver surface, a swollen aneurysm of the celiac artery, and a wedge‐shaped, low‐density area in the lateral area of the liver. Intra‐abdominal hemorrhage was diagnosed because of rupture of a hepatic artery aneurysm, which required massive transfusion and emergency angioembolization within 1 h of the ER visit. Figure <xref rid=""ams2984-fig-0002"" ref-type=""fig"">2</xref> shows the angiographic findings. Stenosis was observed at the celiac trunk origin, and aneurysms were observed in the celiac, common hepatic, and right hepatic arteries. However, the periphery of the right hepatic artery could not be visualized. A right hepatic artery aneurysm was considered responsible for the vascular irregularities and aneurysmal dilatation, while no extravasation was detected. The portal vein was markedly stenotic, possibly caused by pressure from the hematoma. Coil packing was performed using 21 microcoils for the right hepatic artery aneurysm. The portal vein was narrowed; the right lobe of the liver had already been infarcted. We decided not to embolize the celiac or common hepatic artery aneurysm because further embolization might have aggravated the infarction. Angiography of other major abdominal arteries revealed bilateral renal artery aneurysms. The surgery was completed within 90 min. The total required transfusion was 18 units of concentrated red blood cells and 16 units of fresh frozen plasma. The serum liver enzyme (ALT) of the patient rose up to about 1300 IU/L on day 3, but did peak out. Slight high serum CRP level (about 10 mg/dL) without fever and abdominal pain owing to remaining abdominal hematoma persisted by day 12 while serum leukocytes of the patient were normalized in day 5 (File <xref rid=""ams2984-supitem-0001"" ref-type=""supplementary-material"">S1</xref>).

Surgical and irradiated case of early breast cancer in a patient with Ehlers–Danlos syndrome,,"Ehlers–Danlos syndrome (EDS) is an inherited connective tissue disease characterized by hyperextensibility of the skin and joints and tissue fragility of the skin and blood vessels due to abnormal collagen genes. It is classified into 13 types. EDS occurs in approximately 1 in 5,000 people, with vascular EDS being the most common type, as it is caused by type III collagen, which is the most severe form, with a high risk of arterial dissection, aneurysm rupture, and intestinal rupture [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR1"">1</xref>–<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR3"">3</xref>]. However, there are few reports of breast cancer in patients with EDS and none in Japan. Herein, we report an extremely rare case of breast cancer in a patient with vascular EDS, along with literature review. EDS is characterized by hyperextensibility of the skin and joints and easy bleeding associated with fragility of the skin and blood vessels. A new international classification system was proposed in 2017; therefore, 13 different disease types are currently used [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR3"">3</xref>]. Vascular EDS, an autosomal dominant genetic disorder caused by mutations in the type III collagen gene (<italic toggle=""yes"">COL3A1</italic>), is estimated to occur in approximately 5% of all patients with EDS (approximately 1 in 50,000–200,000), with 77% reported to have serious complications such as arterial rupture, dissection, or aneurysm [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR4"">4</xref>, <xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR5"">5</xref>]. The type III collagen gene (<italic toggle=""yes"">COL3A1</italic>), the causative gene of vascular EDS, is distributed in many important organs that require stretching, including the heart, blood vessels, gastrointestinal tract, and uterus. This genetic mutation makes it a more severe form of the disease than other forms [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR6"">6</xref>] Furthermore, it has been reported that 25% of patients develop these serious complications by the age of 20 years and 80% by the age of 40 years, with a median age of death of 48 years [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR1"">1</xref>]. Several complications are associated with surgery and other invasive procedures. Standby surgery should be avoided, and a certain view of the treatment has not yet been reached. Treatment of early-stage breast cancer may be preceded by surgical or drug therapy; however, at present, local treatment with surgical therapy is mandatory, except in limited cases such as low-grade, non-invasive cancer [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR7"">7</xref>]. The patient had two lesions, one of which was very early-stage breast cancer (non-invasive ductal carcinoma, cStage 0), and the other had not yet been histologically diagnosed. Therefore, we decided that prior surgical treatment was desirable for both diagnosis and treatment. The patient was judged to be amenable to general anesthesia after preoperative discussions with the attending vascular surgeon and anesthetist at the hospital. During the operation, the patient's blood pressure, pulse, and other circulatory parameters were stable without major problems, and intraoperative findings showed tissue fragility during surgical procedures, such as dissection and resection. No abnormal bleeding was observed, and the surgery was completed without complications. No postoperative hemorrhage as a complication, wound infection, or obvious delayed wound healing was observed. Irradiation of the left breast was performed as planned and completed without any problems. Regarding postoperative radiotherapy, postoperative irradiation after partial mastectomy in patients with early-stage breast cancer is strongly recommended by various guidelines. However, there is little evidence regarding the safety of radiotherapy in patients with EDS. For patients with breast cancer and EDS, Hsieh et al. reported that no significant acute or late toxicity was observed after conventional or hypofractionated radiotherapy of the preserved breast, with only grade 1 dermatitis in all patients (four) [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR8"">8</xref>]. In contrast, Chau et al. reported that postoperative radiotherapy with additional boost irradiation in a patient with breast cancer with vascular EDS, as in the present case, resulted in grade 3 rather than severe dermatitis after 3 weeks [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR9"">9</xref>]. Based on these reports, we judged that breast radiotherapy was likely to be safe and performed postoperative radiotherapy in this case because the patient had negative margins and did not require ""additional boost irradiation”. As a result, no post-irradiation complications have been observed. We encountered a patient with early-stage breast cancer and rare vascular EDS who underwent surgery under general anesthesia with preoperative treatment planning in collaboration with various departments. Postoperative radiotherapy was successfully completed without major adverse events. In conclusion, in patients with vascular EDS with high comorbidities requiring careful management, surgery and postoperative radiotherapy may be acceptable with careful planning and manipulation.

Investigation of dermal collagen nanostructures in Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome (EDS) patients,"Ehlers-Danlos syndromes (EDS) represent a group of rare genetic disorders affecting connective tissues. Globally, approximately 1.5 million individuals suffer from EDS, with 10,000 reported cases in Canada alone. Understanding the histological properties of collagen in EDS has been challenging, but advanced techniques like atomic force microscopy (AFM) have opened up new possibilities for label-free skin imaging. This approach, which explores Type I collagen fibrils at the nanoscale, could potentially enhance EDS diagnosis and our knowledge of collagen type I-related connective tissue disorders. In the current study, we have employed AFM to examine ex-vivo skin biopsies from four individuals: one with classical EDS (cEDS), one with hypermobile EDS (hEDS), one with hEDS and Scleroderma (hEDS-Scleroderma), and one healthy control. Picrosirius red (PS) staining was used to highlight collagen differences in the samples. For each case, 14 images and 1400 force curves were obtained, with seven images and 700 force curves representing healthy collagen (PS-induced red staining) and the rest showcasing disrupted collagen (yellow staining). The results showed that PS staining was uniform throughout the control section, while cEDS and hEDS displayed localized areas of yellow staining. In the case of hEDS-Scleroderma, the yellow staining was widespread throughout the section. AFM images revealed irregular collagen fibrils in the disrupted, yellow-stained areas, contrasting with aligned and well-registered collagen fibrils in healthy, red-stained regions. Additionally, the study assessed the ability of non-AFM specialists to differentiate between healthy and disrupted collagen in AFM images, yielding substantial agreement among raters according to Fleiss’s and Cohen’s kappa scores (0.96 and 0.79±0.1, respectively). Biomechanical analysis revealed that normal healthy collagen exhibited a predominant population at 2.5 GPa. In contrast, EDS-affected collagen displayed subpopulations with lower compressive elastic modulus, indicating weaker collagen fibrils in EDS patients. Although these findings pertain to a limited number of cases, they offer valuable insights into the nanoscale collagen structure and biomechanics in individuals with EDS. Over time, these insights could be developed into specific biomarkers for the condition, improving diagnosis and treatment for EDS and related connective tissue disorders.","Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (EDS) is a heterogeneous group of inherited connective tissue disorders [<xref rid=""pone.0307442.ref001"" ref-type=""bibr"">1</xref>, <xref rid=""pone.0307442.ref002"" ref-type=""bibr"">2</xref>]. Approximately 1.5 million individuals have received genetic diagnoses for EDS, with around 10,000 cases reported in Canada alone. However, a significant number of individuals, estimated at 255 million, display the clinical characteristics of EDS but have not been diagnosed due to the absence of identifiable genetic mutations associated with the condition [<xref rid=""pone.0307442.ref003"" ref-type=""bibr"">3</xref>–<xref rid=""pone.0307442.ref007"" ref-type=""bibr"">7</xref>]. EDS classification has changed over the years based on the inheritance and clinical presentation. In 1988, the ""Berlin nosology"" defined 11 subtypes of EDS based on their inherent characteristics and clinical manifestations. Subsequently, in 1997, the ""Villefranche nosology"" was released and used as the classification system for EDS for two decades [<xref rid=""pone.0307442.ref008"" ref-type=""bibr"">8</xref>–<xref rid=""pone.0307442.ref010"" ref-type=""bibr"">10</xref>]. The current 2017 EDS nosology remains rooted in genetic markers and clinical presentation, which introduce subjective elements into the classification process. Moreover, the classification system does not comprehensively address hypermobile EDS (hEDS), which leads to late or misdiagnosis. It currently takes an average of ten to 16 years from the onset of symptoms before a correct diagnosis of hEDS is made [<xref rid=""pone.0307442.ref011"" ref-type=""bibr"">11</xref>]. The two most prevalent types of EDS are classical EDS (cEDS) and hypermobile EDS (hEDS) [<xref rid=""pone.0307442.ref012"" ref-type=""bibr"">12</xref>]. cEDS is an autosomal dominant connective tissue disorder characterized by skin hyperextensibility, abnormal wound healing, and joint hypermobility. Skin manifestations in cEDS can include easy bruising, atrophic scarring, and fragility, while joint hypermobility may lead to recurrent dislocations or subluxations [<xref rid=""pone.0307442.ref013"" ref-type=""bibr"">13</xref>–<xref rid=""pone.0307442.ref015"" ref-type=""bibr"">15</xref>]. Mutations in COL5a1 or COL5a2 genes, responsible for encoding type V collagen, are observed in over 90% of cEDS cases. Type V collagen is a crucial component of collagen Type I and III fibrillogenesis nucleation. In rare cases, mutations in the COL1A1 gene, responsible for encoding type I collagen, are also identified [<xref rid=""pone.0307442.ref010"" ref-type=""bibr"">10</xref>, <xref rid=""pone.0307442.ref016"" ref-type=""bibr"">16</xref>–<xref rid=""pone.0307442.ref019"" ref-type=""bibr"">19</xref>]. hEDS shares several clinical features with EDS subtypes but lacks confirmed genetic markers. Joint hypermobility and chronic pain are prominent in hEDS, with an increased risk of developing conditions like fibromyalgia [<xref rid=""pone.0307442.ref013"" ref-type=""bibr"">13</xref>] and chronic fatigue syndrome [<xref rid=""pone.0307442.ref020"" ref-type=""bibr"">20</xref>]. The lack of objective markers for hEDS makes the diagnosis difficult, and often, healthcare providers do not have adequate knowledge to make a timely diagnosis of EDS, resulting in perceived trauma for patients who struggle with multisystemic EDS related symptoms. This form of medical trauma stems from perceived hostility and disinterest from healthcare providers, leading to psychological distress and aversive responses toward healthcare encounters [<xref rid=""pone.0307442.ref021"" ref-type=""bibr"">21</xref>–<xref rid=""pone.0307442.ref023"" ref-type=""bibr"">23</xref>]. Thus, proper diagnosis and comprehensive care for both cEDS and hEDS require a multidisciplinary approach and are crucial for improving the care and well-being of individuals with hEDS. The most recent criteria for hypermobile Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (hEDS) were defined by the 2017 International Classification for the Ehlers-Danlos Syndromes, which the International Consortium published on the Ehlers-Danlos Syndromes [<xref rid=""pone.0307442.ref010"" ref-type=""bibr"">10</xref>]. The 2017 criteria for hypermobile Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (hEDS) consist of three domains: i) assessment of generalized joint hypermobility using the Beighton score, ii) evaluation of skin involvement, musculoskeletal pain, and other systemic characteristics associated with EDS, and iii) exclusion of other conditions related to hypermobility Beighton score involves a series of nine maneuvers tests to evaluate flexibility and hypermobility in various joints. The following criteria are typically used: a) Passive dorsiflexion of each little finger beyond 90 degrees (1 point for each hand); b) Passive apposition of the thumbs to the flexor aspects of the forearm (1 point for each thumb); c) Hyperextension of each elbow beyond 10 degrees (1 point for each elbow); d)Hyperextension of each knee beyond 10 degrees (1 point for each knee); e) Ability to place the palms on the floor with straight legs (1 point). Therefore, the maximum Beighton score is 9 points (5 for the fingers, 2 for the thumbs, and 1 each for the elbows and knees). A higher score signifies a greater degree of joint hypermobility, and generalized joint hypermobility is considered to be present if an individual scores 5 points or more. While the Beighton score is a useful tool, a diagnosis of Ehlers-Danlos syndrome is typically based on a combination of clinical evaluation, family history, and genetic testing. Not everyone with hypermobility has EDS, and other factors are considered in the diagnostic process. We hypothesize that individuals with EDS experience impairments in dermal collagen’s structural and mechanical characteristics at the nanoscale, leading to disruptions in the dermis’s overall structural and mechanical integrity. The current case study involved employing Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM) to image and perform mechanics on ex-vivo skin biopsies sourced from one patient diagnosed with cEDS, one patient with hEDS, one with hEDS-scleroderma, and one healthy control. Although the findings presented in this study pertain to the four examined cases, they provide novel perspectives on the nanoscale collagen structure and biomechanics in individuals with EDS. These insights may serve as the foundation for future research into specific biomarkers for the condition. Atomic Force Microscopy is a high-resolution imaging technique used to study a wide range of samples across various scientific disciplines. Unlike optical microscopes that use light, AFM operates by scanning a sharp tip (typically 20 nm in diameter) over the surface of a sample. As the probe moves across the material, it experiences attractive and repulsive forces between the atoms on the tip and those on the sample surface [<xref rid=""pone.0307442.ref024"" ref-type=""bibr"">24</xref>–<xref rid=""pone.0307442.ref026"" ref-type=""bibr"">26</xref>]. These interactions cause the cantilever to deflect, and the deflections are measured to create a detailed 3-dimensional topographic map of the sample’s surface. In addition, the probe can be used as an indenter and perform localized mechanical measurements directly onto the sample to extract valuable and specific information such as Young’s Modulus [<xref rid=""pone.0307442.ref027"" ref-type=""bibr"">27</xref>]. Unlike other microscopy methods, such as scanning/transmission electron and fluorescence microscopy, AFM excels in providing detailed topographical and mechanical data at the nanoscale without needing sample preparations like labeling or coating, making it an effective tool for examining various collagen structures without altering their fibrillar integrity [<xref rid=""pone.0307442.ref028"" ref-type=""bibr"">28</xref>–<xref rid=""pone.0307442.ref030"" ref-type=""bibr"">30</xref>]. This makes AFM a very competent technique to perform histological assessment of tissues with unprecedented resolution [<xref rid=""pone.0307442.ref031"" ref-type=""bibr"">31</xref>–<xref rid=""pone.0307442.ref033"" ref-type=""bibr"">33</xref>]. AFM has previously used for connective tissue morphometry studies such as Study of the extracellular connective tissue matrix in patients with pelvic organ prolapse [<xref rid=""pone.0307442.ref034"" ref-type=""bibr"">34</xref>], nanohistological investigation of scleroderma [<xref rid=""pone.0307442.ref035"" ref-type=""bibr"">35</xref>], oral submucous fibrosis [<xref rid=""pone.0307442.ref036"" ref-type=""bibr"">36</xref>], assessments of extracellular matrix in intervertebral disc and degeneration [<xref rid=""pone.0307442.ref037"" ref-type=""bibr"">37</xref>], and many other studies. In this study we have employed AFM to examine ex-vivo skin biopsies obtained from EDS patients to characterize collagen morphometric differences in cEDS and hEDS.   In conclusion, histology image analysis combined with nanoscale investigations using Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM) has provided valuable insights into the structural alterations within the dermal collagen matrix in individuals with Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome (EDS). These findings could revolutionize the diagnosis and understanding of EDS subtypes, particularly hypermobile EDS (hEDS), which often lacks specific diagnostic markers. Histological analysis revealed distinct differences in collagen organization and density between healthy individuals and those with EDS, with a notable impact on the mechanical behavior of the skin. Polarized light microscopy further emphasized these differences, highlighting the presence of disrupted collagen in EDS cases. Additionally, the use of Sirius Red staining and polarization allowed for quantifying collagen disruption, providing valuable information for assessing EDS severity. The correlation between nanoscale AFM images and histological staining patterns demonstrated unique structural characteristics within the collagen scaffold of EDS patients. These characteristics, such as disrupted collagen fibrils and amorphous collagen, could be potential biomarkers for EDS subtypes. The reliability and repeatability of identifying disrupted collagen regions by non-specialists through AFM-based nanoscale assessments further support the potential for developing diagnostic tools based on collagen structural variations. Furthermore, evaluating collagen fibril elasticity using AFM nanoindentation revealed distinct mechanical properties in healthy and disrupted collagen regions. These findings can potentially contribute to developing specific biomechanical markers for EDS subtypes, particularly hEDS, which currently lacks diagnostic criteria. ",N/A,22 8 2024
Internal carotid artery dissection associated with an elongated hyoid bone in a patient with vascular Ehlers-Danlos syndrome,"Hyoid bone-related carotid injury is a rare cause of neurovascular events. This report describes a case of a young, healthy male presenting with neck pain followed by left-sided hemiparesis. The patient was diagnosed with a transient ischaemic attack attributed to structural damage of the vascular surface of the right internal carotid artery as a direct result of continuous compression by an elongated hyoid bone. We describe a successful diagnosis using a series of manoeuvres during a six-vessel cerebral angiogram. Genetic testing later confirmed the diagnosis of vascular Ehlers-Danlos syndrome."," This case gives insight into manoeuvres performed throughout a six-vessel angiogram to determine the cause of a vascular injury in a young patient who presented with a new onset of neurological symptoms. While at work, an individual in their 20s went to drink water after carrying a heavy load and suddenly experienced neck pain in the right side of the anterior cervical region, exacerbated by head movement. The patient later presented with decreased sensitivity in the left hemibody, dizziness and decreased visual acuity. The patient was taken to the emergency department, where neurological examination disclosed mild left-sided arm and leg weakness (4/5). The family history demonstrated that the patient’s father had passed away due to aortic dissection. Laboratory investigations, including serology, were within normal reference ranges. Non-contrast cranial CT showed no signs of ischaemia or haemorrhage; hence, the patient was diagnosed with transient ischaemic attack of unknown aetiology.

An enhanced angiotomography of the carotid arteries (<xref rid=""F2"" ref-type=""fig"">figures2 </xref><xref rid=""F3"" ref-type=""fig""> 3</xref>) revealed a dissection of the right brachiocephalic artery with extension to the right common and ipsilateral internal carotid artery (ICA). <xref rid=""F4"" ref-type=""fig"">Figures4 </xref><xref rid=""F5"" ref-type=""fig""> 5</xref> show a six-vessel cerebral diagnostic digital subtraction angiography (DSA) that was performed when the patient was asked to swallow and rotate the neck to both the right and left side. The hyoid bone was observed to make an impregnation above the dissected segment of the right ICA (C1 segment) in probable relation to etiological origin. These findings concluded that mechanical compression of the ICA by the hyoid bone induced by neck rotation and extension was related to the ICA dissection. Findings of vessel fragility during surgery indicated a weak connective tissue disease; therefore, a genetic analysis was performed and revealed a heterozygous autosomal dominant mutation in COL3A1, c.1379_1406delinsA p.Ala460_Ser469delinsGlu, confirming the diagnosis of vascular Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (vEDS). A weak connective tissue disease was suspected due to the patient’s tissue fragility. To confirm the diagnosis of a connective tissue disease, genetic and molecular biological assays were performed, revealing an autosomal dominant mutation in the <italic toggle=""yes"">COL3A1</italic> gene. Dual antiplatelet therapy (DAT) with aspirin and clopidogrel was initiated post-procedure; endovascular therapy was avoided due to familial history of arterial dissection and lack of evidence supporting intervention. Cervical surgical exploration confirmed the external compression of the ICA by the posterior horn of the hyoid bone, requiring bone fragment resection (<xref rid=""F6"" ref-type=""fig"">figure 6</xref>).

During the angiography, it was noted that certain neck movements, including rotation, potentially increased regional flow turbulence, which may have induced the thrombi formation. The action of swallowing and violent coughing was also tested.

"Is Exon Skipping a Viable Therapeutic Approach for Vascular Ehlers–Danlos Syndrome with Mutations in <italic toggle=""yes"">COL3A1</italic> Exon 10 or 15?","Vascular Ehlers–Danlos syndrome or Ehlers–Danlos syndrome type IV (vEDS) is a connective tissue disorder characterised by skin hyperextensibility, joint hypermobility and fatal vascular rupture caused by <italic toggle=""yes"">COL3A1</italic> mutations that affect collagen III expression, homo-trimer assembly and secretion. Along with collagens I, II, V and XI, collagen III plays an important role in the extracellular matrix, particularly in the inner organs. To date, only symptomatic treatment for vEDS patients is available. Fibroblasts derived from vEDS patients carrying dominant negative and/or haploinsufficiency mutations in <italic toggle=""yes"">COL3A1</italic> deposit reduced collagen III in the extracellular matrix. This study explored the potential of an antisense oligonucleotide (ASO)-mediated splice modulating strategy to bypass disease-causing <italic toggle=""yes"">COL3A1</italic> mutations reported in the in-frame exons 10 and 15. Antisense oligonucleotides designed to redirect <italic toggle=""yes"">COL3A1</italic> pre-mRNA processing and excise exons 10 or 15 were transfected into dermal fibroblasts derived from vEDS patients and a healthy control subject. Efficient exon 10 or 15 excision from the mature <italic toggle=""yes"">COL3A1</italic> mRNA was achieved and intracellular collagen III expression was increased after treatment with ASOs; however, collagen III deposition into the extracellular matrix was reduced in patient cells. The region encoded by exon 10 includes a glycosylation site, and exon 15 encodes hydroxyproline and hydroxylysine-containing triplet repeats, predicted to be crucial for collagen III assembly. These results emphasize the importance of post-translational modification for collagen III homo-trimer assembly. In conclusion, while efficient skipping of target <italic toggle=""yes"">COL3A1</italic> exons was achieved, the induced collagen III isoforms generated showed defects in extracellular matrix formation. While therapeutic ASO-mediated exon skipping is not indicated for the patients in this study, the observations are restricted to exons 10 and 15 and may not be applicable to other collagen III in-frame exons.","Collagen III is considered one of the fibril-forming collagens [<xref rid=""B1-ijms-25-08816"" ref-type=""bibr"">1</xref>,<xref rid=""B2-ijms-25-08816"" ref-type=""bibr"">2</xref>,<xref rid=""B3-ijms-25-08816"" ref-type=""bibr"">3</xref>,<xref rid=""B4-ijms-25-08816"" ref-type=""bibr"">4</xref>,<xref rid=""B5-ijms-25-08816"" ref-type=""bibr"">5</xref>] and plays a vital role as a structural collagen fibre in the extracellular matrix (ECM). Collagen III is usually associated with collagen I [<xref rid=""B6-ijms-25-08816"" ref-type=""bibr"">6</xref>], although present mostly in soft tissues.

Studies suggest that collagen III might provide ‘flexibility’ in these soft tissues [<xref rid=""B16-ijms-25-08816"" ref-type=""bibr"">16</xref>], and hence the rupture of internal organs, particularly vascular rupture, is commonly reported in Ehlers–Danlos Syndrome type IV; vascular type (vEDS, EDS type IV; MIM #130050) caused by <italic toggle=""yes"">COL3A1</italic> mutations. Vascular Ehler Danlos syndrome is a dominantly inherited disease with an estimated prevalence of 1 in 90,000 [<xref rid=""B17-ijms-25-08816"" ref-type=""bibr"">17</xref>]. All EDS subtypes are caused by mutations in connective tissue proteins, and joint hypermobility, skin hyperextensibility, and tissue fragility features are common to all subtypes. Congenital hip dislocation and spontaneous pneumothorax are two of the criteria that can distinguish vEDS from other EDS subtypes, based on the International EDS Consortium, 2017. These criteria were developed from the Villefranche diagnostic criteria [<xref rid=""B18-ijms-25-08816"" ref-type=""bibr"">18</xref>] by including genetic testing via targeted or Sanger sequencing and family history [<xref rid=""B19-ijms-25-08816"" ref-type=""bibr"">19</xref>]. Following diagnosis of vEDS, genetic counselling and genetic testing of the family members is helpful in disease management and family planning [<xref rid=""B20-ijms-25-08816"" ref-type=""bibr"">20</xref>]. In particular, pregnant vEDS patients are at the highest risk of distended uterus leading to rupture, with subsequent fatality [<xref rid=""B21-ijms-25-08816"" ref-type=""bibr"">21</xref>]. Generally, the management of vEDS is limited and no curative treatment is available. vEDS patients are advised to avoid using antiplatelet and/or anticoagulant medications and avoid aggressive physical activity or rapid acceleration/deceleration activities since the vasculature is very fragile. The main medical treatment for vEDS is to manage blood pressure. In addition, vEDS patients are at risk of sudden, unpredictable life-threatening bleeding from vascular rupture. Therefore, apart from blood pressure control, open surgery for vascular ligation is another conservative therapy for vEDS patients [<xref rid=""B22-ijms-25-08816"" ref-type=""bibr"">22</xref>]. Causative mutations of vEDS can be broadly divided into two groups, according to the proposed pathogenic mechanisms: dominant negative and haploinsufficiency mutations [<xref rid=""B23-ijms-25-08816"" ref-type=""bibr"">23</xref>,<xref rid=""B24-ijms-25-08816"" ref-type=""bibr"">24</xref>,<xref rid=""B25-ijms-25-08816"" ref-type=""bibr"">25</xref>]. The observation that dominant negative mutations result in a shorter life expectancy than haploinsufficiency type mutations [<xref rid=""B26-ijms-25-08816"" ref-type=""bibr"">26</xref>] suggests that an allele-specific knock-down strategy could potentially delay the age of onset in those with dominant negative mutations. However, the tools and strategies required to efficiently target a single nucleotide difference between healthy and mutant allele transcripts and bring about allele-specific knockdown is possible but remains challenging. Alternatively, removal of selected exons from the transcripts encoded by both alleles, while maintaining the open reading frame and periodicity of the protein (G-X-Y repeats) using antisense oligonucleotide (ASO)-mediated exon skipping, could potentially treat vEDS disease. ASO-mediated exon-skipping strategies have been successfully developed and are now in clinical use to treat Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) patients. Although induced exon skipping does not provide a cure for DMD, targeted exon skipping reduces disease severity by inducing dystrophin isoforms typically associated with the milder allelic disorder, Becker muscular dystrophy (BMD) [<xref rid=""B27-ijms-25-08816"" ref-type=""bibr"">27</xref>]. However, supported by extensive clinical datasets on BMD patients, exon skipping is assumed to be most applicable to exons encoding the spectrin-like repeats in the rod domain. Exon skipping cannot be applied to all the <italic toggle=""yes"">DMD</italic> exons, as those encoding the amino and carboxy terminal domains are essential to function [<xref rid=""B28-ijms-25-08816"" ref-type=""bibr"">28</xref>]. Although collagen III contains many Gly-X-Y repeat motifs, those exons encoding the termini may not be amenable targets for therapeutic exon skipping, as these encoded domains are essential for normal collagen III folding. However, small in-frame exons encoding the G-X-Y repeat helix region could be potentially amenable targets for exon skipping. One caveat is that, unlike dystrophin, collagen III exists as a homo-trimer, and heterozygous <italic toggle=""yes"">COL3A1</italic> splice site mutations leading to exon skipping are typically associated with a poor prognosis [<xref rid=""B29-ijms-25-08816"" ref-type=""bibr"">29</xref>], most likely due to the production of collagen III isoforms of unequal length that affect trimer assembly, exerting a dominant negative effect. We hypothesise that perhaps inducing skipping of the target exon from transcripts encoded by both alleles should produce collagen III monomers of the same length that can be assembled appropriately and retain some function [<xref rid=""B30-ijms-25-08816"" ref-type=""bibr"">30</xref>]. Our hypothesis is supported by reports of natural in-frame exon skipping from <italic toggle=""yes"">COL7A1</italic> transcripts that assembled correctly into a homo-trimer and are implicated in milder cases of recessive dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa, a rare form of skin disease [<xref rid=""B31-ijms-25-08816"" ref-type=""bibr"">31</xref>,<xref rid=""B32-ijms-25-08816"" ref-type=""bibr"">32</xref>]. Skipping of in-frame exon 73 preserved G-X-Y periodicity and restored the expression of collagen VII [<xref rid=""B32-ijms-25-08816"" ref-type=""bibr"">32</xref>]. Similarly, an exon-skipping strategy was evaluated in a mouse model of X-linked Alport syndrome, a rare kidney disease caused by mutations in <italic toggle=""yes"">COL4A5</italic>, and was shown to improve the collagen IV heterotrimer formation and prolong the survival of mice [<xref rid=""B33-ijms-25-08816"" ref-type=""bibr"">33</xref>]. Despite these studies, there are no reports of exon skipping therapies for Ehlers–Danlos Syndrome type IV.  Antisense oligomer-mediated exon-skipping strategies that maintain the open reading frame and periodicity of the protein have been shown to be a viable therapeutic approach for diseases caused by defects in the genes-encoding proteins with repeat motifs such as <italic toggle=""yes"">DMD</italic> [<xref rid=""B35-ijms-25-08816"" ref-type=""bibr"">35</xref>], <italic toggle=""yes"">COL7A</italic> [<xref rid=""B32-ijms-25-08816"" ref-type=""bibr"">32</xref>] and <italic toggle=""yes"">COL4A5</italic> [<xref rid=""B33-ijms-25-08816"" ref-type=""bibr"">33</xref>] (MIM #300377, MIM #226600, MIM #301050, respectively). Likewise, collagen III is a structural protein that is encoded by <italic toggle=""yes"">COL3A1</italic> which contains mostly in-frame exons, making an ASO-induced exon-skipping strategy promising for vEDS. Therefore, this study explores exon skipping as a plausible therapy for vEDS. The removal of redundant exon(s) from the <italic toggle=""yes"">COL3A1</italic> transcripts may rescue extracellular collagen III expression, which is a hallmark of a disease phenotype. We hypothesize that removal of one of these in-frame exons from the transcripts encoded by both alleles could preserve protein periodicity and functionality. We chose two representative majority type of mutations including haploinsufficiency and dominant negative to explore which type of mutation can be beneficial for ASO-induced restoration of open reading frame. Two patient fibroblast lines were studied, one with a haploinsufficiency mutation within exon 10 (c.766delA) and the other with a dominant negative mutation causing exon 15 skipping (IVS14-2A>G). Firstly, we confirmed the mutation that has been reported on the Coriell Institute website (<uri http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink href=""https://www.coriell.org/"">https://www.coriell.org/</uri>, accessed on 19 March 2024). A patient fibroblast carrying c.766delA is predicted to cause frameshift mutation leading to nonsense-mediated decay. We observed a restore of <italic toggle=""yes"">COL3A1</italic> transcript following the treatment of cycloheximide; a nonsense-mediated decay inhibitor (<xref rid=""app1-ijms-25-08816"" ref-type=""app"">Supplementary Figure S3</xref>), hence, further confirmed that <italic toggle=""yes"">COL3A1</italic> haploinsufficiency is the underlying mechanism leading to vEDS in this patient (c.766delA). On the other hand, an in-frame exon 15 skipping was detected in a patient fibroblast carrying IVS14-2A>G with a reduction in total <italic toggle=""yes"">COL3A1</italic> transcript compared to a healthy control fibroblast. We have confirmed that this reduction in <italic toggle=""yes"">COL3A1</italic> transcript is not from nonsense-mediated decay (<xref rid=""app1-ijms-25-08816"" ref-type=""app"">Supplementary Figure S3</xref>). The level of <italic toggle=""yes"">COL3A1</italic> transcript did not increase after treating with cycloheximide, which clearly inhibited nonsense-mediated decay of <italic toggle=""yes"">HNRNPD</italic> transcript. Hence, it is likely to be a variation of <italic toggle=""yes"">COL3A1</italic> expression among individuals which may occur following different conditions such as injury and aging [<xref rid=""B36-ijms-25-08816"" ref-type=""bibr"">36</xref>,<xref rid=""B37-ijms-25-08816"" ref-type=""bibr"">37</xref>]. Both patient fibroblasts present with a reduction in collagen III protein compared to healthy control fibroblast as detected by western blot and immunofluorescence assay. We identified ASO sequences that efficiently induced target exon skipping and assessed collagen III protein expression by western blotting and collagen III assembly by immunofluorescence staining after induced exon skipping. A combination of western blot and immunofluorescence analyses allowed us to assess not only the changes in total intracellular and extracellular collagen III expression but also the collagen III homotrimer/fibril assembly. The analyses minimize any misinterpretation of increased collagen III expression due to collagen III aggregation/accumulation instead of the rescue effect of collagen III following ASO treatment. However, no apparent phenotype rescue was observed in patient cells afterwards, despite achieving around 90% exon skipping with no reduction in RNA expression (<xref rid=""app1-ijms-25-08816"" ref-type=""app"">Supplementary Figure S4</xref>). This result may be explained by the possibility that (i) exon 10 and exon 15 encode amino acids that undergo post-translational modifications crucial for collagen III assembly and/or (ii) skipping of exon 10 or 15 altered amino acids at the splice junctions, leading to interference with flexibility and trimerization, resulting in a disease-like phenotype at the selected time of analysis. Since the observed cell health was compromised starting at day 6, day 4 was selected as the best time point to assess collagen III protein expression in this study (<xref rid=""app1-ijms-25-08816"" ref-type=""app"">Supplementary Figures S5 and S6</xref>). Collagen III is a fibrillar type of collagen composed of 51 exons, where exon 5 to exon 47 encode for the G-X-Y repetitive region and are all in-frame within this domain [<xref rid=""B7-ijms-25-08816"" ref-type=""bibr"">7</xref>]. This makes the <italic toggle=""yes"">COL3A1</italic> transcript theoretically ideal for exon-skipping strategies while maintaining the periodicity of G-X-Y repeats. However, our study revealed that even highly efficient exon skipping could not address mutations that cause vEDS, despite the fact that collagen III forms homotrimers and the induced transcripts should be translated into the same protein isoform. The nature of fibrillar collagen III may mean that the correct protein folding is essential and there is no tolerance for changes. This could be the reason why the phenotype is much milder in patients with null mutations than those with substitutions or splice-site mutations leading to exon skipping [<xref rid=""B29-ijms-25-08816"" ref-type=""bibr"">29</xref>]. On the other hand, the collagen IV family are non-fibrillar, contain G-X-Y repeats and are a major component of the basement membrane, forming a chicken-wire like meshwork. This structure possibly allows some tolerance to structural changes such as imperfections [<xref rid=""B38-ijms-25-08816"" ref-type=""bibr"">38</xref>]. Furthermore, a splice site mutation in the <italic toggle=""yes"">COL4A5</italic> transcript appears to be less severe than mutations causing truncation in the X-linked Alport syndrome [<xref rid=""B39-ijms-25-08816"" ref-type=""bibr"">39</xref>]. This indicates that even though most collagens share the same structure of G-X-Y repeats, the level of tolerability to changes in the protein structure may vary. This, therefore, affects the therapeutic approach to take, especially when considering a RNA modulating strategy such as exon skipping. These findings further highlight the importance of protein studies in the exon-skipping strategy. Glycine, or G, is the smallest amino acid and is present in the innermost of every third position, allowing for coiling of the coiled-coil structure. The proline at the ‘X’ position is essential for collagen interchain hydrogen bonding, N-H<sub>(Gly)</sub>···O=C<sub>(X)</sub>, and triple helix stability. Post-translational modifications such as proline hydroxylation, lysine hydroxylation and hydroxylysine glycosylation are crucial for collagen thermal stability [<xref rid=""B40-ijms-25-08816"" ref-type=""bibr"">40</xref>,<xref rid=""B41-ijms-25-08816"" ref-type=""bibr"">41</xref>] and fibril cross-linking. Loss of hydroxyproline or mutation in proline-4-hydroxylase enzyme appears to affect the collagen trimerization [<xref rid=""B42-ijms-25-08816"" ref-type=""bibr"">42</xref>]; however, the loss of glycosylation or mutations that affect this site have never been reported for collagen III. Glycosylated residues are reported to interact with the endocytic mannose receptor family in collagen IV, but the mechanism is still unclear [<xref rid=""B43-ijms-25-08816"" ref-type=""bibr"">43</xref>]. The amino acids encoded by exon 10 contain two hydroxyproline sites and the only glycosylation site in collagen III (<xref rid=""app1-ijms-25-08816"" ref-type=""app"">Supplementary Table S1</xref>). In addition, it appears that skipping of some triple-helix-region exons might yield protein isoforms that interfere with the formation of interchain hydrogen bonds in the homo-trimer. Interchain hydrogen bonds are typically formed between the amide group of glycine and the carboxy group of proline; however, Hua et al. found that arginine can also form such bonds [<xref rid=""B44-ijms-25-08816"" ref-type=""bibr"">44</xref>]. Both exons 10 and 15 encode proline and hydroxyproline, residues that are known to be important for interchain hydrogen-bond formation. Although not all hydroxyproline residues form interchain hydrogen bonds, the remaining non-hydrogen bond forming hydroxyproline residues are important for helix formation in fixing the angle of the C-N peptidyl-proline or peptidyl-hydroxyproline (cis-trans isomerization of N-terminal peptide bond in proline and hydroxyproline) bonds that allow the polypeptide chains to fold into a helical formation [<xref rid=""B45-ijms-25-08816"" ref-type=""bibr"">45</xref>]. Consequently, the loss of any hydroxyproline sites encoded within an exon targeted for exon skipping might affect trimerization. Nevertheless, additional studies are required to confirm this possibility, such as collagen folding assays [<xref rid=""B46-ijms-25-08816"" ref-type=""bibr"">46</xref>,<xref rid=""B47-ijms-25-08816"" ref-type=""bibr"">47</xref>]. During the trimerization process, 3.2 amino acids are involved in one turn of the collagen helix. One residue is always glycine, as it is the smallest amino acid and is required to fit into the innermost space of the helix to accommodate the other two amino acids in the turn. While removal of exons 10 or 15 maintains the reading frame of the encoded G-X-Y repeats, the change of X or Y to Z amino acids might still disrupt the overall helical secondary structure. Skipping of exon 10 changes the alignment of [hydroxyproline-glycine-isoleucine] to [hydroxyproline-glycine-phenylalanine] and skipping of exon 15 changes the alignment of [hydroxyproline-glycine-proline] to [hydroxyproline-glycine-glutamic acid] (<xref rid=""app1-ijms-25-08816"" ref-type=""app"">Supplementary Figure S7</xref>). A single amino acid change in the plane might affect trimerization due to amino acid property changes and the side chain interfering with trimerization and thereby cause a disease-like phenotype. This study explored ASO-mediated skipping of two in-frame <italic toggle=""yes"">COL3A1</italic> exons as potential strategies to treat Vascular Ehlers–Danlos syndrome. While efficient skipping of the target exons was achieved, our data do not support skipping of <italic toggle=""yes"">COL3A1</italic> exons 10 or 15 as a viable treatment. However, each in-frame exon carrying a disease-causing mutation would need to be explored for exon skipping suitability, post-translational modification and protein folding. Despite the exon-skipping strategy maintaining the G-X-Y repeat periodicity, loss of a single exon could still affect the formation of interchain hydrogen bonds. Furthermore, the roles and functions of collagen III post-translational modifications, such as glycosylation and helical hydroxylysine, remain unclear, as does the full scope of collagen III interactions with other molecules. A detailed computational analysis of collagen III folding may provide new insights into these relationships, as would protein interaction studies. ASOs have been developed to treat what was considered an untreatable disease, DMD, arising from a missing/non-functional dystrophin. However, the delivery of ASOs remains the main issue for non-liver targets and the cost of the drugs is too high to be affordable without government medical benefits or insurance cover. This cost would be even higher if more than one ASO (as observed in exon 10 skipping in this study) is required to be effective. Other strategies evaluated for vEDS as gene replacement or allele silencing were also considered very challenging for vEDS. Perhaps CRISPR/Cas gene editing can be made to be very safe and specific, although one would anticipate great challenges in specificity when targeting the collagen genes.  The results of this study provide further evidence that correct trimerization is crucial to collagen III assembly and secretion. Trimerization of collagen III is proving highly sensitive to perturbation as there is a high incidence of missense mutations reported to cause vEDS. From our observations, both intracellular and extracellular collagen III levels were not improved in vEDS patient-derived cells after ASO-mediated exon skipping, indicating that collagen III modification and assembly within the cells were affected and that these exons are indispensable. However, we cannot conclude that exon skipping is not a viable approach for other <italic toggle=""yes"">COL3A1</italic> exons.",N/A,13 8 2024
An exploration of the journey to diagnosis of Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome (EDS) for women living in Australia,,"Ehlers-Danlos syndromes (EDS) are a group of rare heritable connective tissue disorders [<xref rid=""pone.0307574.ref001"" ref-type=""bibr"">1</xref>], characterised ‘by the abnormal formation and/or assembly of collagen, fibrillin and elastin in the body’ (page 1) [<xref rid=""pone.0307574.ref002"" ref-type=""bibr"">2</xref>]. EDS can lead to multi-systemic complications including generalised joint hypermobility, joint instability complications, widespread musculoskeletal pain, poor skin integrity, cardiovascular dysfunction, and gastrointestinal dysfunction [<xref rid=""pone.0307574.ref002"" ref-type=""bibr"">2</xref>]. There is no cure for EDS [<xref rid=""pone.0307574.ref001"" ref-type=""bibr"">1</xref>,<xref rid=""pone.0307574.ref003"" ref-type=""bibr"">3</xref>], only symptom management and prevention of further deterioration [<xref rid=""pone.0307574.ref004"" ref-type=""bibr"">4</xref>]. While historically the prevalence of EDS was thought to be approximately 1 in 5000 cases annually worldwide, more recent figures suggest that prevalence is higher at around 120 per 100,000 [<xref rid=""pone.0307574.ref005"" ref-type=""bibr"">5</xref>]. Based on the 2017 international classification system, EDS is divided into 13 subtypes [<xref rid=""pone.0307574.ref001"" ref-type=""bibr"">1</xref>,<xref rid=""pone.0307574.ref006"" ref-type=""bibr"">6</xref>,<xref rid=""pone.0307574.ref007"" ref-type=""bibr"">7</xref>] of which Hypermobile EDS (hEDS) is the most common type [<xref rid=""pone.0307574.ref008"" ref-type=""bibr"">8</xref>,<xref rid=""pone.0307574.ref009"" ref-type=""bibr"">9</xref>], estimated to account for approximately 90% of EDS diagnoses [<xref rid=""pone.0307574.ref010"" ref-type=""bibr"">10</xref>]. hEDS is generally considered to be the least severe type of EDS but can lead to significant musculoskeletal complications resulting from hypermobility and joint instability, along with other comorbid conditions [<xref rid=""pone.0307574.ref010"" ref-type=""bibr"">10</xref>,<xref rid=""pone.0307574.ref011"" ref-type=""bibr"">11</xref>]. While skin hyperextensibility is seen in many types of EDS, this symptom is less common in hEDS [<xref rid=""pone.0307574.ref010"" ref-type=""bibr"">10</xref>]. Symptom severity and progression of hEDS is likely impacted by factors such as age, gender and lifestyle [<xref rid=""pone.0307574.ref007"" ref-type=""bibr"">7</xref>]. While most types of EDS are caused by mutations in genes, no gene has yet been identified as the cause of hEDS [<xref rid=""pone.0307574.ref001"" ref-type=""bibr"">1</xref>]. Consequently, a genetic diagnosis is indicated for all subtypes, except hEDS [<xref rid=""pone.0307574.ref010"" ref-type=""bibr"">10</xref>]. Past challenges in diagnosing hEDS have included poor knowledge of medical professionals due to its rarity [<xref rid=""pone.0307574.ref012"" ref-type=""bibr"">12</xref>–<xref rid=""pone.0307574.ref016"" ref-type=""bibr"">16</xref>], its multisystem nature [<xref rid=""pone.0307574.ref010"" ref-type=""bibr"">10</xref>,<xref rid=""pone.0307574.ref017"" ref-type=""bibr"">17</xref>,<xref rid=""pone.0307574.ref018"" ref-type=""bibr"">18</xref>] and the lack of consistent diagnostic criteria for hEDS [<xref rid=""pone.0307574.ref016"" ref-type=""bibr"">16</xref>]. New criteria was developed in 2017 by the EDS International Consortium, to provide consistent diagnostic criteria with the aim of reducing future misdiagnoses [<xref rid=""pone.0307574.ref010"" ref-type=""bibr"">10</xref>]. Despite this change in diagnostic criteria, recent studies by Halverson et al. (2021) [<xref rid=""pone.0307574.ref013"" ref-type=""bibr"">13</xref>] and Wang et al. (2024) [<xref rid=""pone.0307574.ref014"" ref-type=""bibr"">14</xref>] have reported that the average time to diagnosis of hypermobility spectrum disorders (HSD), including Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, to be 11–16 years. Participants consistently report being referred to numerous specialists and obtaining multiple alternative diagnoses prior to their formal hEDS diagnosis [<xref rid=""pone.0307574.ref012"" ref-type=""bibr"">12</xref>–<xref rid=""pone.0307574.ref014"" ref-type=""bibr"">14</xref>,<xref rid=""pone.0307574.ref019"" ref-type=""bibr"">19</xref>]. As a result, many hypermobile individuals are not correctly diagnosed until much later in life when joint damage may be irreversible [<xref rid=""pone.0307574.ref012"" ref-type=""bibr"">12</xref>]. Misdiagnoses can lead to inappropriate and sometimes dangerous treatment of their presenting symptoms [<xref rid=""pone.0307574.ref020"" ref-type=""bibr"">20</xref>], potentially resulting in an altered sense of self [<xref rid=""pone.0307574.ref021"" ref-type=""bibr"">21</xref>]. Earlier diagnosis is vital to ensure appropriate treatment and prevent future complications [<xref rid=""pone.0307574.ref022"" ref-type=""bibr"">22</xref>]. Obtaining a diagnosis of hEDS often then opens doors for obtaining additional, accurate diagnoses of postural orthostatic tachycardia Syndrome (POTS) and mast cell activation syndrome (MCAS) [<xref rid=""pone.0307574.ref023"" ref-type=""bibr"">23</xref>]. This is important as patients are increasingly presenting with this triad of syndromes together [<xref rid=""pone.0307574.ref009"" ref-type=""bibr"">9</xref>]. Recent studies which have assessed the lived experience of people through their diagnosis of EDS, have included experiences from the United Kingdom, Sweden and Belgium [<xref rid=""pone.0307574.ref012"" ref-type=""bibr"">12</xref>] and the United States of America [<xref rid=""pone.0307574.ref012"" ref-type=""bibr"">12</xref>–<xref rid=""pone.0307574.ref014"" ref-type=""bibr"">14</xref>]. The lived experiences of people receiving a diagnosis of EDS in Australia is largely unreported. Given that Australia’s healthcare system was independently ranked 5<sup>th</sup> in the world in 2022, above all of these countries [<xref rid=""pone.0307574.ref024"" ref-type=""bibr"">24</xref>], it is important to gain an understanding of the EDS diagnostic experience to add to the global evidence of this rare disease. Several reports indicate that hEDS occurs predominantly in females with over 90% of confirmed cases of hEDS being female [<xref rid=""pone.0307574.ref005"" ref-type=""bibr"">5</xref>,<xref rid=""pone.0307574.ref009"" ref-type=""bibr"">9</xref>,<xref rid=""pone.0307574.ref025"" ref-type=""bibr"">25</xref>]. Recent studies indicate that women with hEDS symptoms have a reduced quality of life and experience more severe sexual dysfunction (often linked to pelvic organ prolapse) compared to men [<xref rid=""pone.0307574.ref026"" ref-type=""bibr"">26</xref>]. Additionally, suicide risk is high in hEDS, with women reporting higher rates of suicide attempts compared to men [<xref rid=""pone.0307574.ref026"" ref-type=""bibr"">26</xref>]. Baeza-Velasco et al.’s 2022 study of women with hEDS reported that 31.4% of the sample had made at least one suicide attempt with 42.8% of patients assessed indicating some risk of suicide [<xref rid=""pone.0307574.ref027"" ref-type=""bibr"">27</xref>]. Given that the average time to diagnosis of hEDS is 10–16 years [<xref rid=""pone.0307574.ref012"" ref-type=""bibr"">12</xref>–<xref rid=""pone.0307574.ref014"" ref-type=""bibr"">14</xref>] it is essential that information is collated from women who have been through this process to truly understand their lived experiences. Further, due to the lack of a pathognomonic biomarker for hEDS, patient reports of their symptoms, particularly before they are accurately diagnosed with hEDS, are often dismissed [<xref rid=""pone.0307574.ref012"" ref-type=""bibr"">12</xref>–<xref rid=""pone.0307574.ref014"" ref-type=""bibr"">14</xref>,<xref rid=""pone.0307574.ref028"" ref-type=""bibr"">28</xref>].

A recent Gender Pain Gap Index report [<xref rid=""pone.0307574.ref030"" ref-type=""bibr"">30</xref>] in the UK indicated that dismissal of physical symptoms most frequently occurs to women. For the same pain symptoms, only 44% of women surveyed received a diagnosis for their pain compared to 66% of men within 11 months [<xref rid=""pone.0307574.ref030"" ref-type=""bibr"">30</xref>]. Thirty percent of women felt that their time to diagnosis was negatively impacted because of their health professional dismissing their pain compared to 18% of men [<xref rid=""pone.0307574.ref030"" ref-type=""bibr"">30</xref>]. The primary aim of this study was to capture female patients’ perspectives and experience regarding their journey to diagnosis of EDS while living in Australia. Factors explored which may influence time to diagnosis included having other family members with an EDS diagnosis, types of health professionals visited and diagnostic tests used. Understanding factors which can impact time to an EDS diagnosis can help to highlight changes needed to the EDS diagnostic pathway and/or support services required for this rare condition in Australia.  One hundred and fifty two eligible participants completed this survey regarding their journey to a diagnosis of EDS in Australia. This survey demonstrated that the majority of women with a diagnosis of EDS in Australia experience negative emotions, distress and trauma during their journey to diagnosis, consistent with findings from similar studies from other developed countries. Participants indicated that their journey to diagnosis was long, with the majority of participants in this study first noticing symptoms more than 15 years prior to an EDS diagnosis. This long journey to diagnosis is consistent with previous publications [<xref rid=""pone.0307574.ref013"" ref-type=""bibr"">13</xref>,<xref rid=""pone.0307574.ref014"" ref-type=""bibr"">14</xref>,<xref rid=""pone.0307574.ref017"" ref-type=""bibr"">17</xref>,<xref rid=""pone.0307574.ref018"" ref-type=""bibr"">18</xref>,<xref rid=""pone.0307574.ref043"" ref-type=""bibr"">43</xref>] and in fact is even longer than previous reports in this female-only study population. While the majority of participants in this study were diagnosed since 2020, most of them reported that they had been experiencing symptoms for 15 years prior to their official diagnosis. Interestingly, having a relative with a diagnosis of EDS, and therefore family history, did not reduce the time to diagnosis for the participants in this study. These findings suggest that, similar to other countries [<xref rid=""pone.0307574.ref012"" ref-type=""bibr"">12</xref>–<xref rid=""pone.0307574.ref014"" ref-type=""bibr"">14</xref>], there has been minimal, if any, increase in awareness of EDS in GPs and other health professionals in Australia in recent years. As GPs have an essential role in the coordination of referrals, especially in patients with complex chronic conditions [<xref rid=""pone.0307574.ref044"" ref-type=""bibr"">44</xref>], it is important that education for GPs is prioritised. The International Diagnostic checklist (IDC) for hEDS, developed by the International Consortium 2017 [<xref rid=""pone.0307574.ref045"" ref-type=""bibr"">45</xref>,<xref rid=""pone.0307574.ref046"" ref-type=""bibr"">46</xref>], has been established to increase consistency in the diagnosis of hypermobile EDS (hEDS) [<xref rid=""pone.0307574.ref047"" ref-type=""bibr"">47</xref>,<xref rid=""pone.0307574.ref048"" ref-type=""bibr"">48</xref>], the type of EDS diagnosed in over 90% of the participants in this study. This checklist includes a Beighton score alongside two sets of assessment checklists, which include family history [<xref rid=""pone.0307574.ref010"" ref-type=""bibr"">10</xref>,<xref rid=""pone.0307574.ref035"" ref-type=""bibr"">35</xref>,<xref rid=""pone.0307574.ref043"" ref-type=""bibr"">43</xref>,<xref rid=""pone.0307574.ref049"" ref-type=""bibr"">49</xref>]. The presence of all three criteria indicates a clinical diagnosis of hEDS [<xref rid=""pone.0307574.ref010"" ref-type=""bibr"">10</xref>,<xref rid=""pone.0307574.ref035"" ref-type=""bibr"">35</xref>,<xref rid=""pone.0307574.ref043"" ref-type=""bibr"">43</xref>,<xref rid=""pone.0307574.ref049"" ref-type=""bibr"">49</xref>]. A GP toolkit is also available through Elhers Danlos Support UK to further guide GP referrals [<xref rid=""pone.0307574.ref050"" ref-type=""bibr"">50</xref>]. In this study, participants reported that diagnosing clinicians based their diagnosis of EDS most frequently on a variety of tools including the Beighton scale, clinical criteria and patient-reported pain scores, with only around sixty percent of them indicating that their diagnosis was based on the IDC. Additionally, despite family history being integrated into the IDC, participants with a family history of EDS were not diagnosed faster than those without a family history. However, it must also be acknowledged that patients are not experts in diagnostic testing and therefore the accuracy of this information may not be reliable and cannot be verified. Most participants felt that they were misdiagnosed prior to receiving their formal diagnosis of EDS with over ten percent of respondents reporting that they received more than nine alternative diagnoses prior to their EDS diagnosis. While patients with hEDS frequently present with comorbidities like migraine headaches, postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome (POTS) and fibromyalgia (FM) [<xref rid=""pone.0307574.ref019"" ref-type=""bibr"">19</xref>], the number of alternative diagnoses reported in this study is higher than those reported in similar studies [<xref rid=""pone.0307574.ref019"" ref-type=""bibr"">19</xref>,<xref rid=""pone.0307574.ref049"" ref-type=""bibr"">49</xref>,<xref rid=""pone.0307574.ref051"" ref-type=""bibr"">51</xref>,<xref rid=""pone.0307574.ref052"" ref-type=""bibr"">52</xref>]. In this study 18% of women reported being diagnosed with FM prior to their formal EDS diagnosis. However, as FM alone is not formally recognised by the National Disability Insurance Agency in Australia (NDIA) or Centrelink (Australian welfare system) [<xref rid=""pone.0307574.ref053"" ref-type=""bibr"">53</xref>], there is much debate about how helpful a diagnosis of FM is in terms of support and care for people living in Australia. While some participants were diagnosed with other physical conditions prior to their EDS diagnosis, the majority were diagnosed with psychological conditions, with some participants describing feeling that health professionals perceived them as ‘crazy’, with symptoms being ‘all in their head’, or being hypochondriacs. Unfortunately, this finding is consistent with previous research findings [<xref rid=""pone.0307574.ref012"" ref-type=""bibr"">12</xref>–<xref rid=""pone.0307574.ref014"" ref-type=""bibr"">14</xref>,<xref rid=""pone.0307574.ref015"" ref-type=""bibr"">15</xref>,<xref rid=""pone.0307574.ref029"" ref-type=""bibr"">29</xref>,<xref rid=""pone.0307574.ref054"" ref-type=""bibr"">54</xref>], resulting in an experience which can be dehumanising, causing psychological distress to patients [<xref rid=""pone.0307574.ref055"" ref-type=""bibr"">55</xref>] and increasing mistrust in the medical profession [<xref rid=""pone.0307574.ref056"" ref-type=""bibr"">56</xref>]. Feeling that they are receiving repeat misdiagnoses may also cause people with EDS to give an inaccurate report of their symptoms in an effort to be heard [<xref rid=""pone.0307574.ref057"" ref-type=""bibr"">57</xref>] or can cause them to disengage with health professionals, deterring them from presenting at a hospital for treatment [<xref rid=""pone.0307574.ref058"" ref-type=""bibr"">58</xref>,<xref rid=""pone.0307574.ref059"" ref-type=""bibr"">59</xref>]. Ehler Danlos Support UK suggest that key roles of the GP should be in diagnosing hEDS, validating the patient’s symptoms and co-ordinating care [<xref rid=""pone.0307574.ref050"" ref-type=""bibr"">50</xref>]. Therefore, these findings warrant further research to evaluate GP’s current knowledge of the IDC and how it is currently being utilised in practice in Australia. This may also reveal barriers to GP referrals which are currently unknown. In previous studies, GPs have cited important factors influencing the referral process as being their internal training, guidelines provided, access to specialists and confidence in the specialists [<xref rid=""pone.0307574.ref044"" ref-type=""bibr"">44</xref>]. Future research should focus on the impact of educating GPs to aid the referral process for suspected EDS, ultimately with the goal of diagnosing this condition earlier. Many participants reported that they did not feel listened to by their GP and other health professionals and that these professionals were not well informed about EDS or the possibility that they might have EDS. Participants indicated that if health professionals were more open to patients’ suggestions, they may have felt more supported during the diagnostic process. This finding is consistent with previous research [<xref rid=""pone.0307574.ref012"" ref-type=""bibr"">12</xref>–<xref rid=""pone.0307574.ref014"" ref-type=""bibr"">14</xref>,<xref rid=""pone.0307574.ref060"" ref-type=""bibr"">60</xref>,<xref rid=""pone.0307574.ref061"" ref-type=""bibr"">61</xref>] which also highlights the importance of including patients in open discussion and decision-making processes. Participants viewed it favourably when health professionals listened to them and did not dismiss their concerns. In a study by Bradshaw et al. [<xref rid=""pone.0307574.ref062"" ref-type=""bibr"">62</xref>], patients with chronic and complex care needs described being listened to as one of the most important aspects of building trust with their clinician. It is important that health professionals prioritise listening to their patients and contribute to validating their patients’ experiences. It is worth noting that most respondents conducted their own research into their symptomatology, usually online. This is consistent with Knight et al’s study [<xref rid=""pone.0307574.ref046"" ref-type=""bibr"">46</xref>] which reported that people with an EDS diagnosis are not only aware of current EDS research but also of the deficiencies within the EDS care pathway. This further highlights the lack of support in place for patients as they wait for a formal diagnosis of EDS. Physiotherapy has a key role to play in the management of hypermobile EDS [<xref rid=""pone.0307574.ref063"" ref-type=""bibr"">63</xref>]. A 2011 survey by Rombaut et al. found that 63.4% of the hypermobile EDS patients enrolled in a physical therapy program reported a positive effect of the treatment. However, a recent study showed a lack of confidence by physiotherapists in assessment and management of hypermobile EDS [<xref rid=""pone.0307574.ref063"" ref-type=""bibr"">63</xref>]. Physiotherapists in this study were reported to be central to the diagnosis of EDS in 6.6% of cases, emphasising their potential role in identifying potential EDS cases and making appropriate referrals to confirm this diagnosis. Given the importance of their role in EDS rehabilitation in Australia, EDS education for physiotherapists should also be prioritised and integrated into undergraduate education as a mandated component of the curriculum. This education would include review of the components of the IDC alongside theoretical and practical learning regarding the appropriate treatment for patients with all types of EDS. Despite a geneticist diagnosing almost a third of EDS cases in this study, there is currently no identifable gene which has been found to be associated with hEDS [<xref rid=""pone.0307574.ref046"" ref-type=""bibr"">46</xref>,<xref rid=""pone.0307574.ref047"" ref-type=""bibr"">47</xref>], the type of EDS diagnosed in the majority of patients [<xref rid=""pone.0307574.ref008"" ref-type=""bibr"">8</xref>,<xref rid=""pone.0307574.ref009"" ref-type=""bibr"">9</xref>]. Genetic testing is available for every type of EDS except for hEDS [<xref rid=""pone.0307574.ref008"" ref-type=""bibr"">8</xref>,<xref rid=""pone.0307574.ref009"" ref-type=""bibr"">9</xref>]. This suggests that, while geneticists have strong knowledge of all types of EDS, the services that they provide are mainly suitable for only a small number of EDS patients. Subsequently, referral pathways from GPs for people with suspected EDS need to be more clearly guided to ensure that resources are been utilised optimally. Ultimately, participants in this study suggested that more education and training for all health professionals in Australia, as well as raising public awareness of EDS, may help to improve the diagnostic journey for individuals living with EDS in the future. Based on these findings, it is reasonable to propose that increased education of GPs and other key health professionals involved in EDS care, could improve the journey to diagnosis for women living in Australia. Increasing awareness in the general public as well as within the health and disability sectors may allow for quicker identification of EDS symptoms, reducing unnecessary patient stress and distress during the diagnostic process and lead to shorter lengths of time to diagnosis of this rare condition. This could mean better mental health and wellbeing for patients before, during and after their diagnosis, which may lead to better health outcomes as they adjust to living with EDS. Providing education and training to GPs and other health professionals will be challenging but may be essential to improve the lives of people with EDS in Australia. ",N/A,25 7 2024
