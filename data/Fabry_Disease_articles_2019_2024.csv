Impact of the Covid19 pandemic on health-related quality of life in patients with Fabry disease - implications for future care of patients with rare diseases,,"After the first detection of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in Germany (January 27, 2020), various personal restrictions by national federal law were enacted to confine further spread. These regulations affected everyday life not only of those directly concerned by the disease, but the whole population. Calls for general social distancing, quarantine measures, compulsatory wearing of face masks and “lock downs“(March 22, 2020) followed quickly after the WHO declared Covid19 as a worldwide pandemic on March 12th, 2020 [<xref rid=""bb0005"" ref-type=""bibr"">1</xref>]. The never-before-seen personal limitations and the fear of a new contagious virus affected everyday life and caused deep concerns and worries on multiple levels among individuals. In addition to physical health, the Covid19 pandemic was also a threat for mental health [<xref rid=""bb0010"" ref-type=""bibr"">2</xref>], and affected health-related quality of life (HR-QoL) in a negative way [<xref rid=""bb0015"" ref-type=""bibr"">3</xref>]. Especially patients with chronic (rare) diseases had to face novel additional burdens, including not only a higher risk of a severe disease course, but at the same time appointments with medical health care professionals got cancelled, and even difficulties in the supply of medication arised [<xref rid=""bb0020"" ref-type=""bibr"">4</xref>]. Fabry disease (FD, OMIM <ext-link ext-link-type=""omim"" http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink href=""301500"" id=""ir0005"">301500</ext-link>) is an X-linked lysosomal storage disorder causing multiple organ manifestations due to deficient enzyme α-galactosidase A (EC 3.2.1.22). As a result of reduced or missing enzyme activity, the substrate globotriaosylceramide (Gb3) is not sufficiently degraded and causes cell damage and further pathological cascades, like inflammation, fibrosis, endothelial dysfunction etc. [<xref rid=""bb0025"" ref-type=""bibr"">5</xref>] Many patients present with chronic progressive organ impairment and related complications such as renal and heart failure, cerebral stroke, small fiber neuropathy, and FD-associated pain [<xref rid=""bb0030"" ref-type=""bibr"">6</xref>]. A distinction is made between a severe “classical” phenotype, which typically presents the above-mentioned symptoms, and a “late-onset” phenotype, causing milder symptoms or being limited to certain organs [<xref rid=""bb0035"" ref-type=""bibr"">7</xref>]. Severely affected patients report their first symptoms in childhood - especially pain (crises), unusual sweating behaviour, gastrointestinal involvement. Major systemic complications such as severe kidney injury and cerebrovascular events may affect those patients already as young adults in their second or third decade and lead to end-stage disease earlier than in general population [<xref rid=""bb0040"" ref-type=""bibr"">8</xref>]. In addition to physical symptoms, patients with FD are often also confronted with neuropsychological issues. Depression is herein particularly prevalent and assumed to be still under-diagnosed [<xref rid=""bb0045"" ref-type=""bibr"">9</xref>]. It is currently discussed whether a deposition of Gb3 is directly responsible for neuropsychological symptoms or mainly a dysfunctional processing and coping with physical limitations and/or pain [<xref rid=""bb0050"" ref-type=""bibr"">10</xref>]. As the assessment and monitoring of depression depend on many different factors and life circumstances, it is currently not clear what specific affect can be attributed to FD, so that further research is definitely needed [<xref rid=""bb0055"" ref-type=""bibr"">11</xref>]. Nevertheless, it is clear that both physical and psychiatric manifestations have a strong impact on patients' quality of life. Due to above mentioned considerations, patients with FD present with substantially lower scores for HR-QoL compared to the general population [<xref rid=""bb0060"" ref-type=""bibr"">12</xref>]. The additional impact of the Covid19 pandemic has not been investigated. While patients with chronic diseases were generally considered being “at higher risk“of adverse impact of the pandemic (both widespread diseases such as diabetes [<xref rid=""bb0065"" ref-type=""bibr"">13</xref>] and rare diseases such as Fabry or Pompe [<xref rid=""bb0070"" ref-type=""bibr"">14</xref>]), actual data in rare diseases is very limited. We therefore sought to examine the impact of the Covid19 pandemic on HR-QoL in patients with FD, exemplary for other chronic and/or rare diseases. Finally, we analysed the consequences that we should draw from those findings for the future care of patients with rare diseases.   Analysing the SF-36 scores of patients with FD prior to and after the peak of the Covid19 pandemic in 2020 led to the main finding that the pandemic with its accompanying circumstances had a substantial additional negative impact on patients‘ self-perceived and self-reported HR-QoL. Although slow attenuation of the pandemic and all accompanying circumstances appeared since 2022 and also federal restrictions loosened gradually, there appear to be long-lasting consequences. We found a decline in three domaines of the HR-QoL representing broad facets of everyday life: social, mental and physical. A relevant limitation of our analysis is the missing structured assessment of symptomatic Covid19 infections in our FD patient cohort, mostly due to spatial distance of many patients to the center, but also the specific travel and quarantine stipulations during the pandemic. Deteriorations experienced in HR-QoL might be influenced by severe infections and their physical longterm complications, even if not causing the need for in-hospital stay. Of note, especially the item “energy/fatigue” has been linked with Post-Covid19 Syndrome [<xref rid=""bb0150"" ref-type=""bibr"">30</xref>]. As patients with chronic diseases generally face specific challenges in times of crisis, it is not possible to determine whether patients with FD are specifically more impacted by this syndrome, as overlap occurs. Furthermore, we investigated the impact of the pandemic for a relatively short period of time (1–2 years post its peak). Whether the pandemic caused long-lasting changes in HR-QoL in patients with FD needs to be further monitored in the coming years. Our data imply a negative impact of the worldwide Covid19 pandemic on HR-QoL in patients with FD. Whereas the tendency for decline could be detected in all eight items of the SF36-score, social functioning, energy/fatigue, and role limitations due to physical health remained significant. As patients with FD face specific issues and hurdles inherent in the burden of chronic disease usually requiring lifelong therapy, regular meticulous interdisciplinary care including physiological and social-emotional aspects might be of particular importance. The pandemic has also shown us that a change in mindset concerning future medical care is needed, allowing for improved flexibility in the health care system by means of further progress in digitalisation and strengthening the sector of remote patient care, still under-developed in many countries including Germany.

Using artificial intelligence and promoter-level transcriptome analysis to identify a biomarker as a possible prognostic predictor of cardiac complications in male patients with Fabry disease,"Fabry disease is the most frequently occurring form of lysosomal disease in Japan, and is characterized by a wide variety of conditions. Primarily, the three major types of concerns associated with Fabry disease observed during adulthood that must be prevented are central nervous system, renal, and cardiac complications. Cardiac complications, such as cardiomyopathy, cardiac muscle fibrosis, and severe arrhythmia, are the most common mortality causes in patients with Fabry disease. To predict cardiac complications of Fabry disease, we extracted RNA from the venous blood of patients for cap analysis of gene expression (CAGE), performed likelihood ratio tests for each RNA expression dataset obtained from individuals with and without cardiac complications, and analyzed the correlation between cardiac functional factors observed using magnetic resonance imaging data extracted using artificial intelligence algorithms and RNA expression. Our findings showed that CHN1 expression was significantly higher in male Fabry disease patients with cardiac complications and that it could be associated with many cardiac functional factors. <italic toggle=""yes"">CHN1</italic> encodes a GTPase-activating protein, chimerin 1, which is specific to the GTP-binding protein Rac (involved in oxidative stress generation and the promotion of myocardial fibrosis). Thus, CHN1 is a potential predictive biomarker of cardiac complications in Fabry disease; however, further studies are required to confirm this observation.","Fabry disease (OMIM #<ext-link ext-link-type=""omim"" http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink href=""301500"" id=""ir0005"">301500</ext-link>) is classified as a lysosomal storage disease derived from the dysfunction of the enzyme alpha-galactosidase (GLA) localized in lysosomes, and is one of the most frequently occurring lysosomal diseases. Globotriaosylceramide, a substrate of glycosphingolipids, accumulates in the lysosomes of endothelial and smooth muscle cells, renal and cardiac cells, autonomic ganglia, sweat glands, cornea, and the central nervous system due to GLA dysfunction, resulting in various symptoms such as cerebral infarction, arrhythmia, cardiac hypertrophy, renal failure, hypohidrosis, angiokeratoma, corneal crowding, cataracts, and limb pain. This disease is inherited as an X-linked recessive trait, with male patients generally exhibiting severe symptoms; however, female patients are also frequently affected with symptoms as severe as male patients, although symptom onset may be delayed [<xref rid=""bb0005"" ref-type=""bibr"">1</xref>]. Cardiovascular complications, such as arrhythmia and heart failure, are the leading causes of death of Fabry disease. Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is an important diagnostic toolfor the evaluation of cardiac conditions. Characteristic findings include fibrosis of the left ventricular myocardium, as determined by late‑gadolinium enhancement. The cardiac complications of Fabry disease are difficult to detect which delays treatment. Therefore, an improved method to diagnose Fabry disease is required. Cardiac MRI is the gold standard for evaluating myocardial function, volume, and scarring. Additionally, cardiac MRI is the optimal technique for comprehensive tissue characterization, including the assessment of myocardial edema, myocardial siderosis, myocardial perfusion, and diffuse myocardial fibrosis. Cardiac MRI is therefore an indispensable tool for evaluating congenital heart diseases and heart failure [<xref rid=""bb0010"" ref-type=""bibr"">2</xref>]. Herein, MRI was used for analysis for the following reasons: MRI does not require radiation exposure, children over a certain age can be subjected to testing, and it is more objective than ultrasound examination for evaluation of cardiac function. Radiomic studies using MRI and gene expression profiling include studies on brain tumors [<xref rid=""bb0015"" ref-type=""bibr"">3</xref>,<xref rid=""bb0020"" ref-type=""bibr"">4</xref>] and breast cancer [<xref rid=""bb0025"" ref-type=""bibr"">5</xref>]. In addition, no radiomic studies on MRI and gene expression profiling for genetic disorder exist, except for studies on brain MRIs in patients with juvenile-onset cognitive impairment, white matter dystrophy [<xref rid=""bb0030"" ref-type=""bibr"">6</xref>], and single-gene disorders strongly associated with autistic spectrum disorders [<xref rid=""bb0035"" ref-type=""bibr"">7</xref>]. In this study, we used artificial intelligence (AI) and next-generation sequencing to investigate the prognostic factors of cardiac complications in Fabry disease. AI is an excellent tool for image recognition, and “segmentation” technology was used to analyze images of cardiac complications observed in Fabry disease, and evaluate its results with those of genetic analysis to detect prognostic factors for cardiac complications.   Fabry disease exhibits various syndromes; however, the three major complications after adolescence are central neurological syndromes including cerebral infarction and cerebral hemorrhage; cardiac complications such as arrhythmia and cardiomyopathy; and renal complications. Cardiac complications account for more than half of all deaths by Fabry disease in Japan and globally. Cardiac complications are difficult to predict, and once they become apparent are often irreversible, even with treatments such as enzyme replacement therapy. Therefore, determining the prognosis of cardiac complications is crucial. Of 11 genes with significant differences in expression levels among the three groups, three genes that significantly differed between the groups with and without concomitant cardiac complications in Fabry disease were identified. The MRI images of 12 patients in the Fabry disease group were re-analyzed with the Quantified Imaging Resources software using AI and RCCF between eight parameters. The expression levels of each gene were determined, and significant differences were found in many items between the A and B groups. Ranking of genes revealed that the top three genes were identical. When the sensitivity and specificity of these three genes were tested, CHN1 was at the top of the list. In addition, AI technology has made remarkable progress, especially in the field of diagnostic imaging. The AI segmentation used in this study was extremely useful in the digitization of myocardium movement in the MRI and calculation of the eight parameters required for this study. The <italic toggle=""yes"">CHN1</italic> gene is well-established as the primary cause of Duane's retraction syndrome [<xref rid=""bb0105"" ref-type=""bibr"">21</xref>,<xref rid=""bb0110"" ref-type=""bibr"">22</xref>], and encodes a GTPase-activating protein chimerin 1 specific for the GTP-binding protein Rac, which participates in oxidative stress generation and promotion of myocardial fibrosis, and for a signaling pathway that has an instrumental role in the early development of the central nervous system. Sustained activation of signaling pathways involving GTP-binding proteins may lead to cardiac hypertrophy and fibrosis [<xref rid=""bb0115"" ref-type=""bibr"">23</xref>,<xref rid=""bb0120"" ref-type=""bibr"">24</xref>]. Our findings suggest that <italic toggle=""yes"">CHN1</italic> is involved in the development of the cardiac complications of Fabry disease which are characterized by fibrosis and arrhythmias in the left ventricular myocardial base. The cutoff point for identifying gene clusters was 0.28 CPM, a sensitivity of 0.86, and specificity of 0.875. This point was not higher than that in healthy subjects, which appeared to be appropriate because any further increase in sensitivity would result in the detection of healthy subjects. If the expression of the CHN1 gene would have been higher in older age groups, the increase in expression could be attributed to age-related changes. However, the distribution of the <italic toggle=""yes"">CHN1</italic> gene in all 28 subjects surveyed and in group A showed no correlation between age and expression levels. Thus, the occurrence of cardiac complications in patients with Fabry disease can be predicted by examining <italic toggle=""yes"">CHN1</italic> expression. Gene rankings based on significant differences among the A, B, and C three groups and gene rankings based on the strength of the association in many items in the MRI parameters were identical for the top three genes. The gene expression of <italic toggle=""yes"">ACVR1</italic> (2nd place) and <italic toggle=""yes"">MT1F</italic> (3rd place) may be related; however, the sensitivity for CHN1 alone was greater and more specific than that for the statistical results for the three genes combined. Thus, If the prognosis of future cardiac complications, especially arrhythmia and myocardial fibrosis, can be predicted by examining the RNA expression of CHN1 alone, it will be possible to predict the optimal timing for the initiation of cardiovascular medical intervention and enzyme replacement therapy. It is also considered to be a factor that has a large influence. In Fabry disease, in particular, there are many cases of sudden death due to fatal arrhythmia, and based on these predictions, appropriate interventions, such as prescribing antiarrhythmic drugs and implanting cardioverter defibrillator devices, can be timed better, thus improving patient prognosis and functionality. It is also likely to have a direct impact on the quality of life. However, future studies with an larger cohort size of between 100 and 1000 participants are required to determine whether this prognostic predictor can be used in clinical settings. To date, many studies have already been published on the automatic segmentation of atria and ventricles from cardiac MRI data using AI [<xref rid=""bb0125"" ref-type=""bibr"">[25]</xref>, <xref rid=""bb0130"" ref-type=""bibr"">[26]</xref>, <xref rid=""bb0135"" ref-type=""bibr"">[27]</xref>, <xref rid=""bb0140"" ref-type=""bibr"">[28]</xref>, <xref rid=""bb0145"" ref-type=""bibr"">[29]</xref>, <xref rid=""bb0150"" ref-type=""bibr"">[30]</xref>] and quantitative analysis of cardiac function using this method [<xref rid=""bb0155"" ref-type=""bibr"">31</xref>,<xref rid=""bb0160"" ref-type=""bibr"">32</xref>]; it is anticipated that more detailed studies will be conducted in this field in the future. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to successfully demonstrate quantitative analysis of cardiac function by automatic segmentation using AI and the radiomics of gene expression profiles of genetic disorders using cardiac MRI. The <italic toggle=""yes"">CHN1</italic> gene encoding chimerin 1, which is involved in myocardial fibrosis, was identified as a possible predictor of cardiac complications in Fabry disease based on AI-based MRI and correlation analyses of the transcriptome of RNA extracted from the peripheral blood of patients with Fabry disease and healthy individuals.

Fabry Disease in a Female: A Unique Case Highlighting the Variability in Clinical Presentation,"Fabry disease is a rare X-linked lysosomal storage disorder caused by mutations in the GLA gene, leading to deficient activity of the enzyme alpha-galactosidase A. This enzyme deficiency results in the accumulation of globotriaosylceramide (Gb3) in various tissues, causing multi-systemic manifestations. This case report presents a rare instance of Fabry disease in a 32-year-old female patient, highlighting the unique clinical presentation with multisystem involvement. Fabry disease is an X-linked lysosomal storage disorder that primarily affects males, while females are often considered asymptomatic carriers. Heterozygous females can exhibit a broad spectrum of clinical manifestations, varying from a complete absence of symptoms to the full expression of the disease. The patient presented with a complex array of symptoms, including progressive dyspnea, fever, headache, lower limb pain, and periorbital edema, accompanied by a history of hypertension and chronic kidney disease (CKD). Laboratory investigations revealed severe anemia, elevated renal function parameters, and significant proteinuria. A renal biopsy confirmed the diagnosis of Fabry disease, based on the characteristic histopathological findings of widespread glomerular and segmental tuft sclerosis, as well as podocyte enlargement with fine vacuolization. The patient was managed with a combination of sequential hemodialysis and diuretic therapy. This case is a rare and unique example of Fabry disease in a female patient, with symptoms affecting multiple organ systems, including the renal, cardiovascular, and neurological systems. It underscores the importance of maintaining a high index of suspicion for Fabry disease, even in female patients, and the need for a comprehensive diagnostic approach to ensure timely diagnosis and appropriate management. Early recognition of this rare condition in females is crucial for the implementation of targeted therapies, such as enzyme replacement therapy and oral chaperone therapy, to prevent the progression of multi-organ damage.","Fabry disease, an X-linked lysosomal storage disorder, arises from a deficiency or absence of alpha-galactosidase A (α-GAL A) activity. This enzymatic dysfunction is attributed to genetic mutations in the GLA (galactosidase alpha) gene, located at Xq21.3-q22, resulting in the lysosomal accumulation of glycosphingolipids, predominantly cerebroside trihexoside [<xref rid=""REF1"" ref-type=""bibr"">1</xref>]. Consequently, affected individuals exhibit a significantly elevated risk of developing ischaemic stroke, small-fiber peripheral neuropathy, cardiac dysfunction, and chronic kidney disease (CKD) [<xref rid=""REF2"" ref-type=""bibr"">2</xref>]. The estimated prevalence of Fabry disease is approximately one in 40,000 individuals [<xref rid=""REF3"" ref-type=""bibr"">3</xref>]. However, newborn screening suggests a higher incidence of 1:3, 100 to 1:1500 male births [<xref rid=""REF3"" ref-type=""bibr"">3</xref>,<xref rid=""REF4"" ref-type=""bibr"">4</xref>]. The disease affects all ethnic groups, with males more severely affected than females [<xref rid=""REF5"" ref-type=""bibr"">5</xref>]. Historically, females were considered to be asymptomatic carriers of defective GLA genes who were not vulnerable to the symptoms and vital organ abnormalities [<xref rid=""REF6"" ref-type=""bibr"">6</xref>]. However, recent research has revealed that heterozygous females can exhibit a broad spectrum of clinical presentations, ranging from the complete absence of symptoms to a full manifestation of the classic disease [<xref rid=""REF6"" ref-type=""bibr"">6</xref>]. This variability in disease expression may be attributed, at least partially, to skewed X-chromosome inactivation [<xref rid=""REF7"" ref-type=""bibr"">7</xref>]. This process could lead to a higher proportion of cells expressing the disease-causing mutation in affected organs, resulting in more severe clinical outcomes. Hypertension is frequently observed in Fabry disease patients, primarily due to progressive renal impairment [<xref rid=""REF4"" ref-type=""bibr"">4</xref>]. Both diagnosis and management of Fabry disease present considerable challenges as the disease presents with a broad spectrum of clinical manifestations, ranging from early-onset, severe forms to later-onset variants primarily affecting the heart and kidneys. Early diagnosis and enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) or chaperone therapy are crucial in mitigating organ damage and improving long-term outcomes. However, when organ-specific symptoms are evaluated in isolation, the underlying systemic etiology may be overlooked [<xref rid=""REF5"" ref-type=""bibr"">5</xref>,<xref rid=""REF6"" ref-type=""bibr"">6</xref>]. We present a rare case of Fabry disease in a female patient, exemplifying the intricate interplay between molecular pathology and multisystem clinical manifestations. The resultant deficiency or dysfunction of alpha-galactosidase A in this patient leads to the progressive accumulation of globotriaosylceramide within lysosomes, primarily affecting the vascular endothelium, kidneys, myocardium, and nervous system. A 32-year-old female with a known history of hypertension and CKD presented to the emergency department with a complex array of symptoms. The patient's chief complaints included progressive dyspnea over a 10-day period, low-grade to moderate fever (100°F to 102°F) for four days, and a three-month history of headache, lower limb pain, and periorbital edema. Her past medical history was significant for oliguria accompanied by frothy urine and orthopnea. The patient had previously undergone three sessions of hemodialysis and had received blood transfusions. Obstetric history revealed the patient to be P3A1L2 (three pregnancies, one abortion, and two living children). Upon physical examination, the patient was found to be in a stable general condition, albeit with notable vital sign abnormalities. Her blood pressure was elevated at 170/90 mmHg, with tachycardia (110 beats per minute) and tachypnea (35 breaths per minute). The patient was febrile (101°F) with an oxygen saturation of 94% on room air. Random blood glucose was 137 mg/dL. Clinical examination revealed pallor and edema, but no icterus, clubbing, cyanosis, or lymphadenopathy. Cardiovascular and gastrointestinal examinations were unremarkable. Respiratory auscultation demonstrated bilateral basal crepitations. Neurologically, the patient was fully conscious with a Glasgow Coma Scale score of 15, although she reported paresthesia. Laboratory investigations revealed significant hematological and biochemical abnormalities (Table <xref rid=""TAB1"" ref-type=""table"">1</xref>). The patient's hemoglobin was markedly reduced at 5.2 g/dL, indicative of severe anemia. While the total leukocyte count (7100/mm³) and differential counts were within normal ranges, renal function tests were notably abnormal. Blood urea (109 mg/dL) and serum creatinine levels were substantially elevated (5.6 mg/dL), confirming significant renal impairment. Electrolyte analysis showed normal sodium (137 mEq/L) and slightly elevated potassium (4.8 mEq/L) levels. Liver function tests and coagulation parameters (PTI 85%) were within normal limits, and viral markers were non-reactive. Urinalysis demonstrated significant proteinuria (+++) without glycosuria, ketonuria, or pyuria. Renal ultrasonography suggested bilateral medullary disease. A renal biopsy was considered necessary because the patient had significant renal impairment, including CKD, elevated renal function parameters (blood urea and serum creatinine), and marked proteinuria, which prompted further investigation to elucidate the underlying pathology (Figures <xref rid=""FIG1"" ref-type=""fig"">1</xref>, <xref rid=""FIG2"" ref-type=""fig"">2</xref>). Histopathological examination revealed widespread glomerular and segmental tuft sclerosis within the renal medulla and cortical parenchyma. Notably, the podocytes exhibited enlargement with fine vacuolization, a characteristic finding in Fabry disease (Figures <xref rid=""FIG3"" ref-type=""fig"">3</xref>, <xref rid=""FIG4"" ref-type=""fig"">4</xref>). However, no evidence of crescent formation, tuft necrosis, intracapillary thrombi, or congophilic deposits in the visualized glomeruli was noted. These histological features, combined with the clinical presentation and biochemical profile, led to a definitive diagnosis of Fabry disease. The patient's management involved sequential hemodialysis and diuretic therapy. To control hypertension, the patient was started on enalapril at a dose of 5 mg twice daily, with a target range of 5-40 mg per day. Follow-up was scheduled every four to six weeks to monitor blood pressure, renal function (estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), creatinine), and proteinuria. The patient was ultimately discharged in satisfactory condition on a regimen of maintenance hemodialysis. In females, the onset of Fabry disease symptoms mirrors that in males, but with a lower prevalence at any given age [<xref rid=""REF7"" ref-type=""bibr"">7</xref>]. Heterozygous females can experience a range of symptoms, including acroparesthesias, angiokeratomas, hypohidrosis, cornea verticillata, chronic abdominal pain, and diarrhea [<xref rid=""REF8"" ref-type=""bibr"">8</xref>]. With age, they may develop cardiac issues (fibrosis, left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH), arrhythmias, valvular disease), cerebrovascular events (transient ischemic attacks (TIAs), strokes), and, less frequently, kidney problems (proteinuria, CKD) [<xref rid=""REF8"" ref-type=""bibr"">8</xref>]. When CKD occurs, the progression to end-stage kidney disease is similar in males [<xref rid=""REF9"" ref-type=""bibr"">9</xref>]. Cardiac, cerebrovascular, and kidney diseases generally appear a decade later than in males [<xref rid=""REF9"" ref-type=""bibr"">9</xref>]. A Fabry Registry study of 1,077 females found that 70% reported symptoms, with a median onset age of 13 years, and 20% experienced major events by a median age of 46 years [<xref rid=""REF10"" ref-type=""bibr"">10</xref>]. The present rare case of lysosomal storage disorder explains the multisystemic manifestations observed in the female patient, including renal dysfunction, hypertension, and neurological symptoms. Current guidelines recommend screening for Fabry disease in patients exhibiting at least two of the following clinical features: reduced sweating (anhidrosis or hypohidrosis), angiokeratomas (a characteristic reddish-purple skin rash localized to the bathing trunk area), or a personal and/or family history of renal failure [<xref rid=""REF11"" ref-type=""bibr"">11</xref>]. Furthermore, a history of acroparesthesias, characterized by burning or hot pain in the extremities, particularly during febrile episodes, or a history of exercise, heat, or cold intolerance, should prompt further investigation [<xref rid=""REF12"" ref-type=""bibr"">12</xref>]. Diagnostic evaluation is also warranted in individuals with sporadic or non-autosomal dominant patterns of unexplained cardiac hypertrophy, especially in the absence of male-to-male transmission [<xref rid=""REF13"" ref-type=""bibr"">13</xref>]. Microscopic urinalysis can reveal mulberry bodies in the sediments, which are distal epithelial cells with accumulated globotriaosylceramide exhibiting a characteristic whorl-like appearance [<xref rid=""REF14"" ref-type=""bibr"">14</xref>]. Renal biopsy may demonstrate the Maltese cross pattern due to the birefringence of lipid droplets, primarily consisting of cholesterol esters [<xref rid=""REF15"" ref-type=""bibr"">15</xref>]. Treatment strategies for Fabry disease encompass a multifaceted approach, including anticoagulation and enzyme replacement therapies, such as agalsidase beta and pegunigalsidase alfa [<xref rid=""REF16"" ref-type=""bibr"">16</xref>]. Recent advancements have introduced oral chaperone therapy (migalastat) as an additional treatment option. Patient management involves sequential hemodialysis and diuretic therapy [<xref rid=""REF17"" ref-type=""bibr"">17</xref>-<xref rid=""REF18"" ref-type=""bibr"">18</xref>]. This case underscores the importance of a high index of suspicion for Fabry disease in patients presenting with multisystem involvement, particularly renal dysfunction, to ensure timely diagnosis and appropriate management. The present case illustrates the significance of recognizing Fabry disease in female patients, highlighting the need for heightened clinical awareness. The patient's presentation with multisystem involvement, including renal dysfunction and neurological symptoms, underscores the complexity of diagnosing Fabry disease in females who can exhibit a wide spectrum of clinical manifestations. Early diagnosis is crucial to initiate appropriate treatments, such as enzyme replacement and oral chaperone therapies, to mitigate disease progression and improve patient outcomes. This case emphasizes the importance of a comprehensive approach to diagnosing and managing Fabry disease, even in populations traditionally considered at lower risk.",N/A,28 9 2024
Evaluation of global and regional myocardial work by echocardiography in patients with Fabry disease,,"Fabry disease (FD, OMIM 301500) is an X-linked chromosomal disorder caused by a pathogenic variant in the GLA gene, which leads to decrease the activity of α-galactosidase A (α-Gal A) and progressive accumulation of complex sphingolipids, predominantly globotriaosylceramide (Gb3) and lyso-globotriaosylceramide (lyso-Gb3) [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR1"">1</xref>]. Gb3 and lyso-Gb3 can deposit in many types of parenchymal cells, leading to the dysfunction of multiple organs [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR2"">2</xref>]. Cardiac involvement is common in FD and manifests morphologically as concentric remodeling or left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) with consequent alterations in the left ventricular (LV) myocardium [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR3"">3</xref>, <xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR4"">4</xref>]. Previous studies have shown that FD-related cardiac disease is the leading cause of mortality, accounting for 75% of all deaths, and that LV ejection fraction (LVEF) in the majority of patients with FD remains within the normal range until the later stages in the majority of patients with the disease [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR5"">5</xref>, <xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR6"">6</xref>]. Speckle-tracking echocardiography (STE) was developed to calculate the speed, displacement of selected region to calculate myocardial tissue motion, with less dependence on geometric assumptions and loading conditions than conventional echocardiographic parameters [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR7"">7</xref>]. Left ventricular global longitudinal strain (LVGLS) has been reported to be more sensitive than LVEF for early detection of minor myocardial damage and has proven benefit in terms of both diagnosis and risk stratification in FD patients with FD [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR5"">5</xref>], but is limited by loading conditions. On the basis of STE, myocardial work is a novel non-invasive method to characterize systolic myocardial deformation in relation to afterload conditions, and is measured at both the segmental and global levels [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR8"">8</xref>], which may be prior to strain in identifying the early abnormalities of LV systolic function and establishing a more sensitive index for early detection of myocardial dysfunction in patients with FD [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR9"">9</xref>]. In this study, we observed the myocardial work by echocardiographic pressure–strain loop analysis in patients with FD with the aims of detecting functional myocardial alterations and determining the contribution of segmental myocardial work to global myocardial work.   This study used strain measurements and myocardial work to observe patients with FD and healthy controls. The serum creatinine and brain natriuretic peptide were significantly higher, and eGFR, LVEF, and GLS were lower in with FD than in controls. LVH was present in 31.25%, and the interval between disease onset and echocardiographic examination was longer than the pre-hypertrophic phase of FD. We also confirmed that LVEF was relatively lower and GLS was significantly lower in the LVH + group, which is consistent with previous reports. Importantly, global and segmental myocardial work could be evaluated non-invasively by pressure–strain analysis. GWI, GWE, and GCW were lower and GWW was higher in the LVH + group than in the LVH- group and the control group. Moreover, GLS and GWE were associated with LVH in patients with FD. Comparison of segmental strain and myocardial work between the LVH + and LVH– groups revealed the following: basal and middle LS values were reduced and apical LS was preserved; basal and middle MWI and MCW were decreased but apical MWI and MCW were not; MWE was decreased and MWW was increased in all three myocardial regions. Several limitations should be mentioned. First, it had a relatively small sample size. Second, our cohort was from the same center, which may affect the generalizability of its findings. Third, this study excluded patients with poor quality images, which might cause selection bias. Therefore, a multicenter study in a larger sample size is needed to confirm our findings. Myocardial work analysis based on noninvasive LV pressure–longitudinal strain curves is feasible for most patients with FD. GLS and GWE correlate strongly with in Fabry patients with cardiac involvement according to the presence of LVH. Myocardial work in basal and middle segments decreased in relation to the LVH, while apical myocardial work remained basically preserved, suggesting that the equilibrium of apical systolic properties is preserved in both the pre-hypertrophic stage and hypertrophic stage. Myocardial work parameters could be useful tools for more dynamic exploration of the distribution of global and segmental myocardial impairment in FD.",N/A,16 10 2024
NT-proBNP Reflects Left Ventricular Hypertrophy Rather than Left Ventricular Dilatation or Systolic Dysfunction in Patients with Fabry Disease,"<bold>Background</bold>: The diagnosis and follow-up of cardiac involvement in Fabry disease constitutes an important challenge for clinicians caring for affected patients. Combining cardiac imaging with laboratory biomarkers appears most appropriate for longitudinal monitoring. Therefore, we examined the use of NT-proBNP and its association with imaging findings in patients with Fabry disease. <bold>Methods</bold>: We analysed cardiac MRI and echocardiography data, as well as laboratory results, from a single-centre prospective registry. <bold>Results</bold>: Repetitive follow-ups of 38 patients with Fabry disease, of whom 18 presented with left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH), revealed a correlation of NT-proBNP with left ventricular (LV) interventricular septal thickness, LV maximum wall thickness, LV and right ventricular (RV) mass index and trabecular mass in patients with LVH. Patients without LVH did not exhibit any tangible association between NT-proBNP and the mentioned parameters. Conversely, we could not detect an association of NT-proBNP with impairment of LV or RV ejection fraction or diastolic volume. <bold>Conclusions</bold>: NT-proBNP plays a pivotal role as a biomarker for cardiac involvement in patients with Fabry disease. Interestingly, in this specific population with mostly preserved ejection fraction, it seems to reflect ventricular hypertrophy rather than ventricular dysfunction or dilatation. While strong associations were found in hypertrophic patients, NT-proBNP’s prognostic value appears limited in non- or pre-hypertrophic stages.","Fabry disease (Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man [OMIM] #300644) is an X-linked lysosomal storage disorder caused by deficient activity of the enzyme alpha-galactosidase A and results in the accumulation of glycosphingolipids within the cells of various organ systems [<xref rid=""B1-jcm-13-05953"" ref-type=""bibr"">1</xref>]. Besides renal, neurological, gastrointestinal, ophthalmological and dermatological manifestations, cardiac involvement in Fabry disease is common. It is referred to as Fabry cardiomyopathy and occurs in up to 50% of the female and 60% of the affected male patients [<xref rid=""B2-jcm-13-05953"" ref-type=""bibr"">2</xref>]. Moreover, cardiovascular complications remain a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in Fabry patients. Progressive glycosphingolipid deposition and subsequent processes within cardiomyocytes and cells of the cardiac conduction system play a pivotal role in the pathomechanism of the disease. The resulting effects range from left ventricular wall thickening, diastolic dysfunction, arrhythmia, and valvular dysfunction over myocardial fibrosis to systolic dysfunction in advanced stages [<xref rid=""B3-jcm-13-05953"" ref-type=""bibr"">3</xref>,<xref rid=""B4-jcm-13-05953"" ref-type=""bibr"">4</xref>]. However, disease progression is challenging to predict, as it varies between individual patients despite them carrying the same genetic variant [<xref rid=""B5-jcm-13-05953"" ref-type=""bibr"">5</xref>]. Therefore, regular evaluations of the typically affected organ systems, including the kidneys, the central nervous system and the heart, are recommended [<xref rid=""B6-jcm-13-05953"" ref-type=""bibr"">6</xref>,<xref rid=""B7-jcm-13-05953"" ref-type=""bibr"">7</xref>,<xref rid=""B8-jcm-13-05953"" ref-type=""bibr"">8</xref>,<xref rid=""B9-jcm-13-05953"" ref-type=""bibr"">9</xref>,<xref rid=""B10-jcm-13-05953"" ref-type=""bibr"">10</xref>,<xref rid=""B11-jcm-13-05953"" ref-type=""bibr"">11</xref>]. Besides imaging techniques such as cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (CMR) and transthoracic echocardiography (TTE), the assessment of cardiac laboratory biomarkers appears useful. In the literature, N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) and troponins are proposed to be beneficial for the early detection of myocardial involvement [<xref rid=""B12-jcm-13-05953"" ref-type=""bibr"">12</xref>]. Yet, the use of NT-proBNP as a biomarker remains largely underexplored, and data evaluating its long-term progression and detailed associations with imaging parameters are missing so far. This study aims to shed some light on repetitive NT-proBNP measurements in addition to comprehensive cardiac imaging in a real-life cohort of patients with Fabry disease. In this regard, we aim to provide a detailed understanding of NT-proBNP and its role as a biomarker in different stages of the disease. Furthermore, Fabry-specific findings, such as associations with globotriaosylsphingosine (LysoGb3) and low myocardial T1, representing myocardial glycosphingolipid accumulation, are to be investigated.   NT-proBNP has repeatedly been proven to be one of the most important prognostic biomarkers in patients with cardiomyopathies and heart failure with reduced as well as preserved ejection fraction [<xref rid=""B22-jcm-13-05953"" ref-type=""bibr"">22</xref>,<xref rid=""B23-jcm-13-05953"" ref-type=""bibr"">23</xref>]. Stimulated by cardiac wall stress due to myocardial dysfunction or dilatation, release and consecutive elevation of NT-proBNP in the sera of affected patients has become a cornerstone in managing heart failure, as it reflects ventricular volume overload and increased filling pressures [<xref rid=""B24-jcm-13-05953"" ref-type=""bibr"">24</xref>,<xref rid=""B25-jcm-13-05953"" ref-type=""bibr"">25</xref>]. More recently, it has been recognised as a valuable marker in the monitoring of Fabry disease patients. However, these findings are based on a small number of studies that assessed partial aspects of its relationship with cardiac manifestations [<xref rid=""B12-jcm-13-05953"" ref-type=""bibr"">12</xref>]. While several other conditions, such as valvular pathologies, a variety of other cardiomyopathies, arrhythmia, pulmonary hypertension and renal dysfunction, may also lead to increased levels of NT-proBNP, the underlying mechanisms in Fabry disease appear unique [<xref rid=""B26-jcm-13-05953"" ref-type=""bibr"">26</xref>]. Cardiomyocyte hypertrophy with consecutive myocardial wall thickening and diastolic dysfunction is caused by glycosphingolipid accumulation and subsequent processes such as inflammation, autophagy and mitochondrial dysfunction, as well as oxidative stress. These processes ultimately lead to apoptosis, necrosis and fibrosis and differentiate them from other causes of severe left ventricular hypertrophy, such as hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, in which sarcomeric dysfunction triggers signalling pathways leading to cardiomyocyte hypertrophy, cardiomyocyte disarray and fibrosis [<xref rid=""B4-jcm-13-05953"" ref-type=""bibr"">4</xref>,<xref rid=""B27-jcm-13-05953"" ref-type=""bibr"">27</xref>]. As left ventricular dilatation and the impairment of left ventricular systolic function due to replacement fibrosis only appear in very advanced stages, we assume that myocardial wall thickening and diastolic dysfunction are the main contributors to cardiac wall stress and elevations of NT-proBNP in patients with mild or moderate cardiac involvement of Fabry disease. Furthermore, renal involvement leading to chronic kidney disease is common in Fabry disease and could potentially impair the clearance of NT-proBNP. Arrhythmias, with atrial fibrillation being one of the most common, are also frequently found and could further contribute to the levels of NT-proBNP in affected patients due to atrial enlargement [<xref rid=""B4-jcm-13-05953"" ref-type=""bibr"">4</xref>]. To the best of our knowledge, our study is the first to extensively investigate NT-proBNP in association with multimodal cardiac imaging parameters. Analysing the data from comprehensive CMR and TTE examinations, we identified a strong interdependency with markers of ventricular hypertrophy and diastolic dysfunction. In contrast, no compelling associations were found for ventricular dilatation or systolic dysfunction parameters. Additionally, a strong correlation between low septal T1 measurements and NT-proBNP was revealed. This might reflect the involvement of myocardial glycosphingolipid accumulation in the context of subsequently emerging hypertrophy and associated elevation of the biomarker. Torralba-Cabeza et al. were the first to examine the use of NT-proBNP in patients with Fabry disease [<xref rid=""B28-jcm-13-05953"" ref-type=""bibr"">28</xref>]. In 2011, the authors proved the biomarker to reflect organ involvement, as assessed by the Mainz severity score index and diastolic dysfunction. Later, the group of Coats et al. highlighted the role of NT-proBNP in combination with various other echocardiographic parameters. They found left atrial size and E/Ea ratio, reflecting the LV filling pressure, to be independently associated with the levels of NT-proBNP. However, they provided data that markers of LVH, including the left ventricular mass index, failed to show significant associations in the multivariate analysis [<xref rid=""B29-jcm-13-05953"" ref-type=""bibr"">29</xref>]. In line with these previous studies, patients from our cohort who presented with diastolic dysfunction exhibited elevated levels of NT-proBNP. Furthermore, TTE-derived right atrial diameter and systolic pulmonary artery pressure correlated significantly with levels of the biomarker. Conversely, we found a weak correlation between the left ventricular ejection fraction and levels of NT-proBNP in the general cohort but not in the respective sub-groups with or without LVH. In Fabry patients, our data suggest LVH to be the primary factor contributing to elevated NT-proBNP levels. Moreover, left ventricular systolic dysfunction or dilation appear less determining in our cohort. This hypothesis is supported by strong correlations between the biomarker and echocardiographically as well as CMR-measured parameters reflecting hypertrophy. In particular, interventricular septal thickness (TTE), maximum wall thickness (CMR), left ventricular myocardial mass (CMR), LVMI (CMR) and trabecular mass (CMR) were strongly associated with NT-proBNP. On the other hand, right and left ventricular end-diastolic diameters (TTE) or volumes (CMR) exhibited no tangible correlations. These findings appear interesting as NT-proBNP reflects left ventricular function and heart failure occurrence rather well in non-Fabry patients. Earlier reported elevations of NT-proBNP in patients with diastolic dysfunction are possibly intertwined with these hypertrophy-associated findings. A significant overlap of patients with diastolic dysfunction and LVH in our study highlights this possible relationship. While NT-proBNP was repeatedly proven to be a robust predictive marker for diastolic dysfunction in non-Fabry-disease patients, several previous studies also reported the interaction of NT-proBNP and left ventricular hypertrophy [<xref rid=""B24-jcm-13-05953"" ref-type=""bibr"">24</xref>,<xref rid=""B30-jcm-13-05953"" ref-type=""bibr"">30</xref>,<xref rid=""B31-jcm-13-05953"" ref-type=""bibr"">31</xref>,<xref rid=""B32-jcm-13-05953"" ref-type=""bibr"">32</xref>,<xref rid=""B33-jcm-13-05953"" ref-type=""bibr"">33</xref>].  Among others, Linhart et al. discussed the frequent finding of aortic root dilatation in parallel or secondary to LVH as part of the complex of Fabry cardiomyopathy [<xref rid=""B34-jcm-13-05953"" ref-type=""bibr"">34</xref>]. Interestingly, an increase in the ascending aorta diameter, particularly in patients with LVH, was also found to be associated with elevated NT-proBNP levels in our study. Right ventricular involvement in Fabry disease has been reported previously. The findings range from ventricular hypertrophy and impaired ventricular free wall strain to impaired systolic function [<xref rid=""B35-jcm-13-05953"" ref-type=""bibr"">35</xref>,<xref rid=""B36-jcm-13-05953"" ref-type=""bibr"">36</xref>,<xref rid=""B37-jcm-13-05953"" ref-type=""bibr"">37</xref>,<xref rid=""B38-jcm-13-05953"" ref-type=""bibr"">38</xref>]. Accordingly, we found that NT-proBNP levels correlate well with right ventricular myocardial and trabecular mass. However, the evaluation of right ventricular dimensions and function remains challenging. Moreover, cardiac events and prognosis are thought to be mainly impacted by left-sided cardiac involvement [<xref rid=""B36-jcm-13-05953"" ref-type=""bibr"">36</xref>]. Observations in our cohort are in line with this notion, as correlations with right ventricular parameters were only present in patients with left ventricular hypertrophy. Besides LVH, the decrease of myocardial T1 relaxation times, caused by glycosphingolipid accumulation and the presence of basal inferolateral LGE, reflecting myocardial fibrosis, are hallmarks of Fabry cardiomyopathy [<xref rid=""B3-jcm-13-05953"" ref-type=""bibr"">3</xref>,<xref rid=""B39-jcm-13-05953"" ref-type=""bibr"">39</xref>,<xref rid=""B40-jcm-13-05953"" ref-type=""bibr"">40</xref>]. In our study, a decrease in myocardial T1 was associated with higher levels of NT-proBNP. Previous reports highlighted the possibility of low T1 findings in patients without the presence of LVH [<xref rid=""B41-jcm-13-05953"" ref-type=""bibr"">41</xref>]. While other research groups initially demonstrated a correlation between NT-proBNP and the presence or fast increase of LGE, we could not confirm a significant interaction between NT-proBNP and the extent of LGE [<xref rid=""B42-jcm-13-05953"" ref-type=""bibr"">42</xref>,<xref rid=""B43-jcm-13-05953"" ref-type=""bibr"">43</xref>,<xref rid=""B44-jcm-13-05953"" ref-type=""bibr"">44</xref>,<xref rid=""B45-jcm-13-05953"" ref-type=""bibr"">45</xref>]. The prognostic value of NT-proBNP on disease severity and progression is also supported by the significant association of baseline NT-proBNP values with the FOS-MSSI in a linear regression model. Yet, LVH appears to be an important contributor as the linear regression model did not provide significant associations between NT-proBNP and the FOS-MSSI in non-hypertrophic individuals. It is important to note that the FOS-MSSI reflects overall disease severity, as it comprises the involvement of the multiple organ systems potentially affected by Fabry disease [<xref rid=""B13-jcm-13-05953"" ref-type=""bibr"">13</xref>]. For the first time, our study reveals a strong correlation between the Fabry disease-specific laboratory marker LysoGb3 and NT-proBNP in a group of patients with LVH. In this context, the prognostic value of single laboratory biomarkers such as cardiac troponins, creatinine, cystatin C and albumin-to-creatinine ratio appears limited. However, a combination with LysoGb3 and NT-proBNP could overcome the individual diagnostical limitations and shed some light on various underlying pathophysiological aspects. Additionally, compared to protracted measurements of LysoGb3, NT-proBNP assessment is widely available and might constitute a quick possibility to evaluate the state of the disease. This finding emphasises the role of NT-proBNP measurement as part of the regular Fabry disease follow-ups [<xref rid=""B7-jcm-13-05953"" ref-type=""bibr"">7</xref>,<xref rid=""B8-jcm-13-05953"" ref-type=""bibr"">8</xref>,<xref rid=""B12-jcm-13-05953"" ref-type=""bibr"">12</xref>]. Yet, the natural course of NT-proBNP is unknown, and the effects of specific treatment have only been examined by one study so far. The group of Nordin et al. discovered no changes in NT-proBNP levels after one year of enzyme replacement therapy [<xref rid=""B46-jcm-13-05953"" ref-type=""bibr"">46</xref>]. Our data provide evidence for an initially non-significant trend towards higher NT-proBNP levels after 60 months, followed by a significant difference after 90 months in patients receiving specific treatment compared to those without. This course suggests that specific therapy may not fully address the underlying pathophysiology of Fabry disease or the consequences of glycosphingolipid accumulation. Additionally, the finding once more underlines the importance of this biomarker in longitudinal monitoring and might reflect factors such as progressive hypertrophy and aggravating cardiac involvement. Furthermore, our data suggest that patients with LVH and the need for specific therapy exhibit the highest NT-proBNP values as compared to those without these factors. Past research focused on individual parameters derived from TTE or CMR and the consecutive NT-proBNP elevations. In contrast, our data further demonstrate the need for comprehensive cardiac follow-up, including cardiac imaging and laboratory biomarkers, as part of a multimodal approach. There are several findings to our work that constitute its novelty. We were able to highlight that NT-proBNP reflects left ventricular hypertrophy in Fabry patients. In the specific context of our cohort, markers of ventricular dilatation or dysfunction were found less determining. Moreover, the newly depicted association with low septal T1 and LysoGb3 could help to unveil pathophysiological aspects of Fabry disease. Our report on the longitudinal development of NT-proBNP under specific therapy might reflect continuous disease progression and is, to our knowledge, the only available documentation on long-term monitoring currently available in the literature. Finally, we aimed to shed some light on right ventricular involvement in Fabry disease and were able to depict findings reflecting those of the left ventricle. However, this study faces limitations that warrant consideration. Firstly, the low sample size, attributed to the rarity of the disease, the analysis of patients suffering from different stages of Fabry disease, and a relevant number of patients presenting with a cardiac variant of Fabry disease restricts the generalizability of the findings and may affect the statistical power of the analysis. Secondly, the use of NT-proBNP as a biomarker poses challenges due to its lack of specificity for Fabry disease. Serum levels could be influenced by comorbidities such as chronic kidney disease, atrial fibrillation, and hypertension, potentially confounding the interpretation of the results. Thirdly, our data suggest no strong correlation between markers of left ventricular systolic function and NT-proBNP in Fabry patients. However, the low number of individuals with reduced LVEF may partially constitute this finding. Though this might be seen as a limitation, stemming from a real-world cohort, our data reflect the situation physicians are facing as well as the diagnostic value of NT-proBNP in this context. Lastly, the initiation of specific treatment was not standardised, leading to a variable duration of the therapy. Therefore, definitive conclusions regarding the therapeutic effects cannot easily be made. These limitations underscore the need for a cautious interpretation of the study findings and highlight areas for further investigation and refinement in future research endeavours.",N/A,07 10 2024
In Silico Modeling of Fabry Disease Pathophysiology for the Identification of Early Cellular Damage Biomarker Candidates,"Fabry disease (FD) is an X-linked lysosomal disease whose ultimate consequences are the accumulation of sphingolipids and subsequent inflammatory events, mainly at the endothelial level. The outcomes include different nervous system manifestations as well as multiple organ damage. Despite the availability of known biomarkers, early detection of FD remains a medical need. This study aimed to develop an in silico model based on machine learning to identify candidate vascular and nervous system proteins for early FD damage detection at the cellular level. A combined systems biology and machine learning approach was carried out considering molecular characteristics of FD to create a computational model of vascular and nervous system disease. A data science strategy was applied to identify risk classifiers by using 10 K-fold cross-validation. Further biological and clinical criteria were used to prioritize the most promising candidates, resulting in the identification of 36 biomarker candidates with classifier abilities, which are easily measurable in body fluids. Among them, we propose four candidates, CAMK2A, ILK, LMNA, and KHSRP, which have high classification capabilities according to our models (cross-validated accuracy ≥ 90%) and are related to the vascular and nervous systems. These biomarkers show promise as high-risk cellular and tissue damage indicators that are potentially applicable in clinical settings, although in vivo validation is still needed.","Fabry disease (FD) (MIM#301500) is considered as inborn error of glycosphingolipid metabolism due to reduce to null catalytic activity of the acid hydrolase α-galactosidase A (α-Gal A) (EC 3.2.1.22), which results in the accumulation of globotriaosylceramide (Gb3), globotriaosylsphingosine (lyso-Gb3), and other glycosphingolipids (such as galabiosylceramide, Gb2, etc.) in different tissues [<xref rid=""B1-ijms-25-10329"" ref-type=""bibr"">1</xref>]. The disease is caused by pathogenic variants in the <italic toggle=""yes"">GLA</italic> gene (MIM*300644).

The classical form of the disease usually begins in childhood, with earlier involvement in males, while the nonclassical phenotypic condition is characterized by a more variable disease course in which patients are generally less affected initially and manifestations present later, usually during adulthood, and are often confined to a single affected organ [<xref rid=""B9-ijms-25-10329"" ref-type=""bibr"">9</xref>,<xref rid=""B10-ijms-25-10329"" ref-type=""bibr"">10</xref>]. The clinical recognition of these mono-organic forms is crucial in the journey of FD patients, as they do not present the plethora of characteristic signs and symptoms of the disease and because there are phenocopies with higher prevalence at the cardiac level (e.g., hypertrophic cardiomyopathy [<xref rid=""B11-ijms-25-10329"" ref-type=""bibr"">11</xref>]) and renal level. The latter pose a challenge since the phenotypic spectrum can overlap with entities of both non-genetic origin (e.g., IgA or IgM nephropathy) and genetic origin (e.g., Alport syndrome, polycystic kidney disease, or autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease, among others [<xref rid=""B12-ijms-25-10329"" ref-type=""bibr"">12</xref>]). For this reason, genetic screening of FD in nephropathies of unknown origin is particularly relevant today [<xref rid=""B13-ijms-25-10329"" ref-type=""bibr"">13</xref>]. The most characteristic early clinical symptoms in patients with classical FD, especially in the first years of life, are hypo- or anhidrosis and recurrent burning and shooting pain in the distal extremities, which is associated with peripheral neuropathy. Patients usually suffer from a decreased sensation of heat and cold and frequent gastrointestinal disturbances [<xref rid=""B14-ijms-25-10329"" ref-type=""bibr"">14</xref>,<xref rid=""B15-ijms-25-10329"" ref-type=""bibr"">15</xref>,<xref rid=""B16-ijms-25-10329"" ref-type=""bibr"">16</xref>]. Vascular involvement can lead to the development of disease at the cardiac, kidney, and central nervous system (CNS) levels and to cerebrovascular events such as a stroke or transient ischemic attack [<xref rid=""B17-ijms-25-10329"" ref-type=""bibr"">17</xref>,<xref rid=""B18-ijms-25-10329"" ref-type=""bibr"">18</xref>,<xref rid=""B19-ijms-25-10329"" ref-type=""bibr"">19</xref>]. On the other hand, there is a high proportion of patients with a greater risk of developing neuropsychiatric symptoms, such as depression and neuropsychological deficits [<xref rid=""B20-ijms-25-10329"" ref-type=""bibr"">20</xref>]. Late complications and disease progression can eventually cause significant morbidity and mortality [<xref rid=""B21-ijms-25-10329"" ref-type=""bibr"">21</xref>]. The pathogenesis of FD is related to α-Gal A deficiency. The absence of this enzymatic activity causes systemic accumulation endogenously synthesized Gb3, as well as that sourced from the autophagocytosis of cellular membranes, and its deacylated derivative lyso-Gb3, leads to significant cellular alterations [<xref rid=""B22-ijms-25-10329"" ref-type=""bibr"">22</xref>]. At the cellular level, this buildup of undegraded lipid material disrupts the physiological processes of endocytosis and autophagy, induces apoptotic mechanisms, causes mitochondrial dysfunction, and disturbs endoplasmic reticulum homeostasis [<xref rid=""B23-ijms-25-10329"" ref-type=""bibr"">23</xref>]. These disruptions result in inflammatory processes, oxidative stress, and fibrosis that trigger the entire pathophysiology of this disease [<xref rid=""B20-ijms-25-10329"" ref-type=""bibr"">20</xref>,<xref rid=""B24-ijms-25-10329"" ref-type=""bibr"">24</xref>]. Fundamentally, the primary cellular types involved in this accumulation are endothelial cells, epithelial cells, pericytes, myocardial, ganglion, and smooth muscle cells [<xref rid=""B1-ijms-25-10329"" ref-type=""bibr"">1</xref>]. Therefore, the main pathophysiological alterations in FD are vascular dysfunction involving the accumulation of glycosphingolipids, structural alterations of vessel walls, the activation of the endothelium by the release of proinflammatory molecules, and the occurrence of a prothrombotic state [<xref rid=""B25-ijms-25-10329"" ref-type=""bibr"">25</xref>]. The physiopathological basis of the nervous system needs to be better understood. In the CNS, there is cerebral angiopathy. In the peripheral nervous system, the accumulation of glycosphingolipids in Schwann cells and dorsal spinal ganglia seems to affect A-delta and C fibers, which is represented by neuropathic pain and by autonomic alterations. The classical neurological manifestations of FD are neuropathy and premature cerebrovascular disease [<xref rid=""B26-ijms-25-10329"" ref-type=""bibr"">26</xref>]. However, in addition to vascular or neuropathic complications, FD can lead to the development of psychiatric and cognitive disorders [<xref rid=""B27-ijms-25-10329"" ref-type=""bibr"">27</xref>,<xref rid=""B28-ijms-25-10329"" ref-type=""bibr"">28</xref>]. Depression is common, while acute psychotic symptoms, personality and behavior changes, or sleep disturbances may appear less frequently [<xref rid=""B27-ijms-25-10329"" ref-type=""bibr"">27</xref>,<xref rid=""B28-ijms-25-10329"" ref-type=""bibr"">28</xref>,<xref rid=""B29-ijms-25-10329"" ref-type=""bibr"">29</xref>]. Early diagnosis is essential to avoid irreversible organ damage and to promptly apply therapeutic options that can reduce patient morbidity and mortality. In contrast, late disease detection is associated with a lower response to treatment [<xref rid=""B30-ijms-25-10329"" ref-type=""bibr"">30</xref>,<xref rid=""B31-ijms-25-10329"" ref-type=""bibr"">31</xref>]. Real-world data (mainly disease registries) reveal that early enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) could delay progressive organ damage and, therefore, improve patients’ quality of life. Currently, early diagnosis through newborn screening is not universally accepted, primarily due to ethical considerations (e.g., the large number of neonates identified with late-onset or uncertain significance genetic variants) [<xref rid=""B32-ijms-25-10329"" ref-type=""bibr"">32</xref>]. Early diagnosis should be considered in well-recognized risk groups or in relatives of diagnosed probands to prevent the onset of signs and symptoms of the pathology and to improve the prognostic profile by facilitating early therapeutic intervention [<xref rid=""B33-ijms-25-10329"" ref-type=""bibr"">33</xref>]. At present, there are no established early diagnostic tools without incurring ethical limitations, therefore the discovery of early damage biomarkers for FD is an urgent need for the early identification, follow-up, and treatment of patients, and for correct prevention of irreversible damage [<xref rid=""B30-ijms-25-10329"" ref-type=""bibr"">30</xref>,<xref rid=""B31-ijms-25-10329"" ref-type=""bibr"">31</xref>,<xref rid=""B34-ijms-25-10329"" ref-type=""bibr"">34</xref>]. Although much of the research effort has focused on the identification of new biomarkers, lyso-Gb3, the deacylated form of Gb3, has been established as a diagnostic biomarker and for patient stratification in FD; however, the clinical significance of the extent of changes in lyso-Gb3 and its correlation with clinical outcomes are yet to be determined. Therefore, it is advisable to monitor additional nonspecific biomarkers of FD [<xref rid=""B35-ijms-25-10329"" ref-type=""bibr"">35</xref>,<xref rid=""B36-ijms-25-10329"" ref-type=""bibr"">36</xref>]. These nonspecific biomarkers of FD indicate the specific damage to an organ and help measure the progression of the disease or the therapeutic efficacy of treatment. For instance, proteinuria, especially albuminuria, allows the assessment of early kidney damage, whereas the glomerular filtration rate is useful for the assessment of advanced kidney injury. The other helpful approaches are the use of CNS imaging biomarkers and the lack of follow-up symptoms in patients with FD [<xref rid=""B37-ijms-25-10329"" ref-type=""bibr"">37</xref>]. Owing to a vital clinical need, it is necessary to identify biomarkers capable of detecting early vascular and neurological damage, as early clinical events, before irreversible alterations occur in organs at late stages. Computational modeling and systems biology methods are increasingly implemented to help understand the molecular determinants of certain diseases, clarify disease staging, and aid drug discovery [<xref rid=""B38-ijms-25-10329"" ref-type=""bibr"">38</xref>]. Specifically, in the field of rare disease research [<xref rid=""B39-ijms-25-10329"" ref-type=""bibr"">39</xref>,<xref rid=""B40-ijms-25-10329"" ref-type=""bibr"">40</xref>,<xref rid=""B41-ijms-25-10329"" ref-type=""bibr"">41</xref>], where few data are available, integrative approaches can help open new lines of research and advance clinical management. The Therapeutic Performance Mapping System<sup>®</sup> (TPMS) technology [<xref rid=""B42-ijms-25-10329"" ref-type=""bibr"">42</xref>] uses pattern recognition and machine learning techniques to integrate available biological, pharmacological and medical knowledge and create mathematical models that simulate disease phenotypes in silico. The models are built around a complex network of proteins and their known relationships (either physical, biochemical, or regulatory) and allow us to explore the predicted protein activity changes that are induced by altered states (e.g., a pathological state or drug treatment) [<xref rid=""B42-ijms-25-10329"" ref-type=""bibr"">42</xref>,<xref rid=""B43-ijms-25-10329"" ref-type=""bibr"">43</xref>]. This method allows modeling of the pathophysiology of a disease and of possible cellular changes that induce irreversible tissue damage to identify biomarkers that are likely to precede the damage. Through these models, it could be possible to evaluate the involvement of proteins in little-studied manifestations or poorly accessible in vivo tissues, as is the case for neurological manifestations in FD. The results obtained through this technology have been previously proven useful for the exploration of drug mechanisms [<xref rid=""B44-ijms-25-10329"" ref-type=""bibr"">44</xref>,<xref rid=""B45-ijms-25-10329"" ref-type=""bibr"">45</xref>,<xref rid=""B46-ijms-25-10329"" ref-type=""bibr"">46</xref>] and the identification of biomarkers [<xref rid=""B47-ijms-25-10329"" ref-type=""bibr"">47</xref>,<xref rid=""B48-ijms-25-10329"" ref-type=""bibr"">48</xref>]. In silico modeling therefore offers an alternative approach that may help identify protein biomarker candidates for the early identification of and follow-up on FD comorbidities. Accordingly, the aim of this study was to develop and evaluate a FD model to identify biomarkers associated with cellular changes involved in the initiation and progression of organ damage. We also aimed to identify candidate proteins related to vascular alterations, whose implication is characteristic of the disease, and unexplored neuronal involvement. Therefore, we applied the TPMS technology to model FD and used a data science strategy to generate hypotheses for the identification of biomarkers that can detect early damage and could be applied in clinical practice.  The results of this in silico study show that the application of tools based on systems biology and machine learning, such as the TPMS, could help identify potential biomarkers for the early detection of damage in FD that are related to the vascular and nervous systems and allow noninvasive measurement and easy transfer to clinical practice. The most widely used biomarker for FD to date is lyso-Gb3, which has a good utility in FD diagnosis. However, only a limited number of studies have demonstrated the correlation between lyso-Gb3 concentrations and clinical manifestations of the disease [<xref rid=""B35-ijms-25-10329"" ref-type=""bibr"">35</xref>,<xref rid=""B36-ijms-25-10329"" ref-type=""bibr"">36</xref>]. Therefore, more studies are needed to identify precise markers of the disease that could be used before irreversible damage occurs [<xref rid=""B54-ijms-25-10329"" ref-type=""bibr"">54</xref>]. Moreover, the isoforms and/or analogs of Gb3 and lyso-Gb3 could be considered good candidates for the diagnosis of high-risk populations [<xref rid=""B55-ijms-25-10329"" ref-type=""bibr"">55</xref>]. However, there are no very specific biomarkers for the responses to vasculopathy, nephropathy, and/or cardiomyopathy, which are involved in the pathogenic processes that trigger chronic inflammatory pathways and the development of irreversible fibrosis [<xref rid=""B56-ijms-25-10329"" ref-type=""bibr"">56</xref>]. Biomarkers should be evaluated with caution since they do not allow the identification of all the phenotypes and systems affected by the disease. From a systemic point of view, the following biomarkers have been used to assess the effectiveness of ERT and organ damage in FD: inter α-trypsin inhibitor heavy chain 4 (an anti-inflammatory protein), serum amyloid A1 (an acute-phase protein), enolase 1 (a tissue remodeling factor indicating the contribution of ischemic vascular pathology), and the enzyme endothelial nitric oxide synthase [<xref rid=""B57-ijms-25-10329"" ref-type=""bibr"">57</xref>,<xref rid=""B58-ijms-25-10329"" ref-type=""bibr"">58</xref>]. Meanwhile, microRNAs (miR21, miR210, miR29, miR200, miR21-5p, miR19a-3p, and miR184) [<xref rid=""B59-ijms-25-10329"" ref-type=""bibr"">59</xref>,<xref rid=""B60-ijms-25-10329"" ref-type=""bibr"">60</xref>] or circular RNAs [<xref rid=""B61-ijms-25-10329"" ref-type=""bibr"">61</xref>], although they have diagnostic and prognostic utility, are used only for research purposes. Nonspecific molecular and imaging biomarkers of FD are widely used to assess kidney, heart, and blood vessel damage [<xref rid=""B37-ijms-25-10329"" ref-type=""bibr"">37</xref>]. In the case of renal function, the following parameters are used: proteinuria, albuminuria, estimated glomerular filtration rate, uromodulin, N-acetyl-β-D-glycosaminidase and B2M [<xref rid=""B62-ijms-25-10329"" ref-type=""bibr"">62</xref>,<xref rid=""B63-ijms-25-10329"" ref-type=""bibr"">63</xref>]. For cardiac activity and vascular function, 3-nitrotyrosine [<xref rid=""B64-ijms-25-10329"" ref-type=""bibr"">64</xref>,<xref rid=""B65-ijms-25-10329"" ref-type=""bibr"">65</xref>,<xref rid=""B66-ijms-25-10329"" ref-type=""bibr"">66</xref>], tumor necrosis factor (TNF), interleukin-6, and TNF receptors 1 and 2 are used [<xref rid=""B67-ijms-25-10329"" ref-type=""bibr"">67</xref>,<xref rid=""B68-ijms-25-10329"" ref-type=""bibr"">68</xref>]. Despite the availability of all the various biomarkers, few are useful for detecting early damage before irreversible tissue alterations occur in patients with no obvious manifestations of FD. Our findings suggest some candidates that may be associated with the first signs and symptoms of the disease in vascular or neuronal tissues and could improve disease monitoring. In total, we identified 61 candidate biomarkers that can be measured in body fluids and have greater classification potential than the best previously proposed biomarkers (<xref rid=""ijms-25-10329-t001"" ref-type=""table"">Table 1</xref>). One such example is B2M, being a light chain major histocompatibility class, present on the cell surface of nucleated cells. During cellular rearrangements, B2M detaches from the heavy chain and circulates in the bloodstream until it is filtered by the glomerulus. Increased levels of B2M in urine are indicative of early proximal tubular dysfunction [<xref rid=""B69-ijms-25-10329"" ref-type=""bibr"">69</xref>] and show a significant correlation between plasma and urine concentrations, as well as the progression of renal disease in patients with FD [<xref rid=""B70-ijms-25-10329"" ref-type=""bibr"">70</xref>]. In the classical phenotype of FD, the cardiovascular system and neuronal involvement are essential for the development of the disease and for the understanding of the clinical situation of patients. In our study, we carried out an exploratory evaluation to detect biomarkers related to vascular involvement and those that fit into the little-known field of the nervous system. Thirty-six biomarker candidates were identified to be related to vascular or neuronal locations, which are tissues affected early by FD, and thus have the potential to reflect early disease-related changes in these areas. We further highlighted candidates that have been previously functionally associated with FD development (interleukin-18, with great cardiovascular involvement [<xref rid=""B71-ijms-25-10329"" ref-type=""bibr"">71</xref>]) and those with high classification potential (accuracy ≥ 90%) related to both vascular and neuronal tissues (CAMK2A, ILK, LMNA, and KHSRP). These four biomarkers are connected to the effectors of FD. ILK and LMNA could be related to vascular manifestations observed in FD. ILK is an integrin-linked kinase involved in the conformational activation of the lymphocyte function-associated antigen-1 complex, which is responsible for the adhesion and extravasation of neutrophils, primarily by recognizing the intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM-1) present on the vascular endothelium. Deficient expression of ILK leads to suppresses chemokine-induced extravasation of neutrophils and ischemia-induced reperfusion injury [<xref rid=""B72-ijms-25-10329"" ref-type=""bibr"">72</xref>]. LMNA is a protein that forms part of the nucleoskeletal intermediate filaments, playing a multifaceted role in cellular functions. These functions include maintaining the structural integrity of the nucleus, regulating gene expression, and facilitating mechanosensing and mechanotransduction via lamina-associated proteins. [<xref rid=""B73-ijms-25-10329"" ref-type=""bibr"">73</xref>]. From the pathophysiological point of view, vascular pathogenesis in FD is related to the accumulation of glycosphingolipids [<xref rid=""B24-ijms-25-10329"" ref-type=""bibr"">24</xref>]. This process produces a cascading effect, causing endothelial dysfunction and altered arterial remodeling, as well as occlusive phenomena and thrombosis in the medium and long terms [<xref rid=""B74-ijms-25-10329"" ref-type=""bibr"">74</xref>]. ILK promotes monocyte adhesion and extravasation, which may lead to endothelial dysfunction and trigger inflammation and subsequent fibrosis, as observed in the previously mentioned vascular phenomena in FD [<xref rid=""B75-ijms-25-10329"" ref-type=""bibr"">75</xref>]. In addition, the deposition of Gb3 in myocardial cells and the alteration of the expression of adhesion molecules promote inflammation, increased deposition in the extracellular matrix, and fibrosis [<xref rid=""B76-ijms-25-10329"" ref-type=""bibr"">76</xref>]. Dysfunctional LMNA causes defects in the nuclear lamina, which disrupts mechanotransduction and mechanosensing in cardiomyocytes. This disruption leads to changes in gene expression and cellular dysregulation, affecting structures from the nuclear lamina to cell-cell junctions, and significantly contributing to the development of cardiomyopathy as observed in FD [<xref rid=""B73-ijms-25-10329"" ref-type=""bibr"">73</xref>]. Therefore, ILK and LMNA could be involved in the pathophysiology of FD. On the other hand, CAMK2A and KHSRP could be related to nervous system-associated symptoms in patients with FD. CAMK2A is a multifunctional protein kinase involved in excitatory synapses and is central to synaptic plasticity. It has catalytic functions triggered by increased calcium ion concentration, as well as essential structural roles. It is highly expressed in the CNS accounting for 1–2% of total hippocampal proteins and up to 10% of the postsynaptic density [<xref rid=""B77-ijms-25-10329"" ref-type=""bibr"">77</xref>,<xref rid=""B78-ijms-25-10329"" ref-type=""bibr"">78</xref>]. KHSRP takes part of multi-protein complex participating in post-transcriptional control of gene expression (e.g., pre-mRNA splicing, mRNA decay, microRNA biogenesis etc.), particularly constitutes an enhancer element upstream of the c-myc oncogene promoter [<xref rid=""B79-ijms-25-10329"" ref-type=""bibr"">79</xref>]. The scientific literature indicates that the pathogenesis of FD is even localized at the level of the CNS [<xref rid=""B14-ijms-25-10329"" ref-type=""bibr"">14</xref>,<xref rid=""B17-ijms-25-10329"" ref-type=""bibr"">17</xref>,<xref rid=""B20-ijms-25-10329"" ref-type=""bibr"">20</xref>,<xref rid=""B26-ijms-25-10329"" ref-type=""bibr"">26</xref>,<xref rid=""B27-ijms-25-10329"" ref-type=""bibr"">27</xref>,<xref rid=""B28-ijms-25-10329"" ref-type=""bibr"">28</xref>,<xref rid=""B80-ijms-25-10329"" ref-type=""bibr"">80</xref>]. However, there is a notable lack of studies on repercussions beyond cerebral vasculopathy, such as synaptic dysfunction, and on long-term effects, such as depression, Parkinson’s disease, anxiety, and low quality of life, highlighting the need for more research in these areas [<xref rid=""B81-ijms-25-10329"" ref-type=""bibr"">81</xref>]. From a pathophysiological point of view, lysosomal dysfunction can alter the composition of and interactions in the plasma membrane [<xref rid=""B82-ijms-25-10329"" ref-type=""bibr"">82</xref>] and can suppress autophagy and mitochondrial function [<xref rid=""B83-ijms-25-10329"" ref-type=""bibr"">83</xref>]. Therefore, lysosomal dysfunction could interfere with energy production and the maintenance of synaptic homeostasis. On the other hand, alterations in the release of neurotransmitters [<xref rid=""B84-ijms-25-10329"" ref-type=""bibr"">84</xref>] (such as acetylcholine, dopamine, or serotonin) have been observed. Cholinergic neurons are associated with eccrine sweat glands in blood vessels, hair follicles, and cutaneous sensory nerve endings, and acetylcholine release may be associated with the neuropathic pain present in FD. Presynaptic dopaminergic alterations and an imbalance between cholinergic and dopaminergic activities in the CNS are present in patients with FD. According to the scientific literature, in patients with FD, there are alterations at the serotonergic system level. Changes in a broad spectrum of functions (such as mood, cognition, anxiety, learning, memory, reward processing, and sleep) have been observed. These disorders can lead to schizophrenia, mood disorders, and autism [<xref rid=""B85-ijms-25-10329"" ref-type=""bibr"">85</xref>]. CAMK2A as previously noted, is involved in various cellular processes, including cell proliferation, synaptic plasticity, learning, and memory [<xref rid=""B78-ijms-25-10329"" ref-type=""bibr"">78</xref>]. Its role in synaptic function is most likely related to the neurotransmitter dysfunction observed in FD [<xref rid=""B81-ijms-25-10329"" ref-type=""bibr"">81</xref>]. Other hand, KHSRP is a highly expressed protein in neuronal cells [<xref rid=""B86-ijms-25-10329"" ref-type=""bibr"">86</xref>], and it is involved in the immune cell function and homeostasis, inflammatory response, and cell proliferation [<xref rid=""B87-ijms-25-10329"" ref-type=""bibr"">87</xref>]. A deficit in neuronal tissue expression of KHSRP is associated with impaired neuronal development, which, among other effects, results in altered synaptic transmission [<xref rid=""B88-ijms-25-10329"" ref-type=""bibr"">88</xref>], as previously pointed out in FD neuronal pathophysiology. The resulting clinical manifestations derived from these four biomarkers that are proposed by the model could make clinical sense. Various biomarkers depend on the nature of the detected molecule, such as a metabolite, DNA sequence, lipid, or protein [<xref rid=""B89-ijms-25-10329"" ref-type=""bibr"">89</xref>]. One of the limitations of our study is that it was based on a proteomic model. We based our study on previous studies that obtained satisfactory results using machine learning-based technology [<xref rid=""B41-ijms-25-10329"" ref-type=""bibr"">41</xref>,<xref rid=""B42-ijms-25-10329"" ref-type=""bibr"">42</xref>,<xref rid=""B90-ijms-25-10329"" ref-type=""bibr"">90</xref>]. Although we only used molecules of a protein nature, this study could be a good approximation. Notably, in the case of lysosomal diseases, such as FD, accumulated primary and secondary metabolites or proteins that are explicitly secreted by storage cells are good candidates for biomarkers [<xref rid=""B91-ijms-25-10329"" ref-type=""bibr"">91</xref>]. Systems biology and computational modeling are good tools for investigating rare diseases [<xref rid=""B40-ijms-25-10329"" ref-type=""bibr"">40</xref>], they have limitations. First, all modeling approaches are limited by the information about diseases, drugs, and biological data available in public repositories. The molecular definition of FD could be biased or incomplete owing to its wide range of manifestations. However, we were able to identify 92 proteins that are functionally involved in FD development through several cellular-level pathological processes (α-Gal A is absent or malfunctioning, and Gb3 accumulation is involved in oxidative stress, impaired autophagy, cellular death, lipid raft disruption, compromised energy metabolism, and inflammation and immune responses) and are associated with relevant tissue-level dysfunctions in FD, such as vascular dysfunction. We can highlight apoptosis-inducing factor mitochondria associated, nitric oxide synthases 2 and 3, intercellular adhesion molecule 1, vascular cell adhesion molecule 1, superoxide dismutase 2, interleukin-6, TNF-α, endothelial leukocyte adhesion molecule-1, and prostaglandin-endoperoxide synthases 1 and 2, which are associated with oxidative stress, inflammation, and cell death and, subsequently, with vascular dysfunction [<xref rid=""B25-ijms-25-10329"" ref-type=""bibr"">25</xref>,<xref rid=""B92-ijms-25-10329"" ref-type=""bibr"">92</xref>,<xref rid=""B93-ijms-25-10329"" ref-type=""bibr"">93</xref>,<xref rid=""B94-ijms-25-10329"" ref-type=""bibr"">94</xref>]. Furthermore, employing these models, we were able to propose newly described candidates related to both vascular and neuronal locations. Second, owing to their protein interaction-based nature, our models are limited to the evaluation of proteins. Thus, metabolites, lipids [<xref rid=""B95-ijms-25-10329"" ref-type=""bibr"">95</xref>], or other measurable candidates could not be evaluated. While we focused on highlighting the most promising protein-based candidates, the complete list of candidates could be screened to find measurable proxies and obtain further biomarker candidates (<xref rid=""app1-ijms-25-10329"" ref-type=""app"">Supplementary Table S3</xref>). Finally, our models reflect protein activity, and thus, the results might not directly translate to protein levels and, therefore, to clinical symptomatology. Experimental validation of these findings must consider the evaluation of different approaches, in addition to the quantification, such as functional or regulatory changes or even changes at the expression level. From our standpoint, a potential in vitro/in vivo validation [<xref rid=""B96-ijms-25-10329"" ref-type=""bibr"">96</xref>] of the prognostic and early detection potential of the candidates identified in this study would entail quantifying the concentrations of these biomarkers in plasma samples from newly diagnosed classic and atypical Fabry patients, stratified by gender. These biomarker concentrations would be correlated with a validated instrument for assessing overall disease severity and organ-specific domains, such as the Mainz Severity Score Index (MSSI) [<xref rid=""B97-ijms-25-10329"" ref-type=""bibr"">97</xref>]. The plasma levels of the candidate biomarkers, along with the MSSI and their respective domains, would be measured at regular intervals throughout the study period until the patient commences specific treatment or experiences a clinical event related to Fabry disease. Finally, the key is to have biomarkers that help provide more precise and early management of organ damage, particularly in late phenotypes, to conduct early therapeutic intervention and stabilize or slow down the appearance of irreversible comorbidities in patients. Although this was an in silico study, our methodology showed satisfactory results in deciphering the potential mechanism of action of some proteins involved in vascular events [<xref rid=""B46-ijms-25-10329"" ref-type=""bibr"">46</xref>], as well as in nervous system morbidity [<xref rid=""B98-ijms-25-10329"" ref-type=""bibr"">98</xref>]. This in silico study suggests more focused biomarkers to more accurately make evident vascular and neurological damage early, and therefore carry out early intervention in FD. Certainly, human studies with a representative patient cohort are required for validation [<xref rid=""B96-ijms-25-10329"" ref-type=""bibr"">96</xref>]. However, this in silico modeling study presents promising preliminary results for biomarkers which are quantifiable from biological samples easily obtained in routine clinical practice, such as peripheral blood (plasma) and/or urine, suggesting that these biomarkers have excellent future clinical applicability for the early detection of damage in vascular and unexplored neuronal tissues and are not yet applied in routine practice. The in silico study was developed using the TPMS [<xref rid=""B42-ijms-25-10329"" ref-type=""bibr"">42</xref>] based on systems biology, machine learning and pattern recognition techniques that integrate all available biological, pharmacological, and medical knowledge to create mathematical models that simulate pathology and human physiology. <xref rid=""ijms-25-10329-f003"" ref-type=""fig"">Figure 3</xref> summarizes the steps followed in this study.",N/A,25 9 2024
Infrared spectroscopy as a new approach for early fabry disease screening: a pilot study,,"Fabry disease (FD, OMIM 301500)) is a rare X-linked lysosomal storage disorder marked by deficiency or absence of alpha-galactosidase-A (α-Gal-A) (EC 3.2.1.22; α-Gal A) lysosomal enzyme. This hydrolase deficiency, caused by pathogenic mutations in the <italic toggle=""yes"">GLA</italic> gene (NCBI reference sequence: NM_000169.3), leads to an accumulation of glycosphingolipids in biofluids and tissues, especially globotriaosylceramide (Gb3) and globotriaosylsphingosine (lyso-Gb3) [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR1"">1</xref>]. The progressive storage of its nondegraded substrates results in multiorgan damage with life-threatening complications and reduces life expectancy [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR2"">2</xref>]. FD has two main phenotypes referred to as “classic” or “late-onset”. In the male, the “classic” form, the signs and symptoms begin in childhood, including angiokeratoma, acroparesthesias, and hypohidrosis. In older age, patients develop mostly chronic kidney disease (CKD) and cardiac and cerebrovascular disorders. The “late-onset” form is characterized by residual enzyme activity and clinical manifestation confined to one organ, particularly the heart or kidney, in adulthood [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR3"">3</xref>]. Females exhibit a wide range of clinical presentations attributed to the random inactivation of the X chromosome [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR4"">4</xref>]. Due to the phenotypic heterogeneity and nonspecific clinical manifestations, the conclusive diagnosis of FD is challenging for physicians. Some diagnosis can be achieved in males through the measurement of α-Gal-A activity. In females, diagnosis is achieved exclusively through genetic testing since they often present with apparently normal enzymatic activity [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR5"">5</xref>]. Furthermore, the finding of mutations never reported in the literature or variance of uncertain significance (VUS) contributes to difficulties in interpreting clinically relevant phenotypes [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR6"">6</xref>]. Attenuated total reflection Fourier-transform infrared (ATR-FTIR) spectroscopy is a vibrational spectroscopy technique that captures the vibrational energy of organic molecules’ covalent bonds through IR radiation. The generated spectrum provides information about the sample’s chemical composition due to each molecule’s specific spectral molecular signature. Due to the complexity in discriminating different spectral datasets, chemometric methods have long been used to analyse such spectroscopic data from closely matched cohorts. Because of the vast amount of information rapidly acquired collected by the approach, feature selection and classification algorithms have been utilized to analyse biological datasets with high data complexity [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR7"">7</xref>]. In 2022, Tolsik et al. applied another spectroscopy technique (Coherent anti-Stokes Raman, CARS) as a diagnostic tool to assess cardiac FD manifestation in an FD mouse model. In their study, the CARS measurements combined with multivariate data analysis allowed for differentiation between FD and control groups with 90–96% sensitivity. Indeed, CARS identified shifts in lipid/protein content between the two groups in cardiac tissue. This genotype differentiation was successful at a very early time point during disease development when only kidneys were visibly affected by Gb3 depositions [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR8"">8</xref>]. ATR-FTIR spectroscopy has the advantage of being a fast and non-destructive technique that is reproducible, low-cost, requires a minimal volume of the biological sample, reagent free, and requires no previous sample handling [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR7"">7</xref>]. This technique has been successfully tested as a tool for screening, diagnostics, and progression of diseases by examining several biofluid samples, including cells and tissue [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR9"">9</xref>, <xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR10"">10</xref>]. Our group has previously shown the applicability of ATR-FTIR spectroscopy in biofluids, in both animal and human models, as screening for COVID-19 [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR11"">11</xref>–<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR13"">13</xref>], iron overload [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR14"">14</xref>], sepsis severity [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR15"">15</xref>], and cancer [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR16"">16</xref>]. Another metabolic genetic disease has also been studied (galactosaemia), and ATR-FTIR spectroscopy successfully discriminated among diabetic, healthy and galactosaemic subjects. IR spectroscopy performed well compared to the other tests and could easily be adapted for screening new-borns [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR17"">17</xref>]. However, to the best of our knowledge, no studies have applied ATR-FTIR spectroscopy in FD patients. Therefore, this study aimed to evaluate the ATR-FTIR spectral dataset of plasma samples obtained from FD patients and healthy control participants to classify them through machine learning methods. We hypothesize that the spectra from these respective groups contain enough discriminating information to classify the samples, thus providing the potential for a fast, inexpensive screening test.  FD affects 1 in 40,000 males and 1 in 117,000 live births [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR3"">3</xref>], but newborn screening studies suggest an underdiagnosis and the numbers are higher than those reported [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR19"">19</xref>, <xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR20"">20</xref>]. Furthermore, due to the phenotypic heterogeneity and nonspecific clinical manifestations, the suspicion of FD becomes a challenging diagnosis for physicians, and delays in diagnosis approximate 15 years [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR1"">1</xref>]. Although enzyme measurement has been used as a screening tool in the active search for FD in high-risk male groups, these patients are mostly diagnosed at an advanced stage of the disease progression and often have irreversible organ damage. Although ERT can reduce organ injury and delay FD progression, the best therapy outcomes are achieved when initiated in early stages of the disease [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR21"">21</xref>], corroborating the essential need for timely diagnosis. In recent years, efforts have been made to detect affected FD patients. Lyso-Gb3 emerged as a sensitive biomarker and could assist in diagnosing heterozygosity, treatment decisions and monitoring [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR22"">22</xref>]. Lyso-Gb3 also helps predict FD with relevant clinical manifestations, especially in new mutations with no defined pathogenesis [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR23"">23</xref>, <xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR24"">24</xref>]. Although lyso-Gb3 is helpful, its levels must be interpreted with attention. In an experimental study, raised levels of lyso-Gb3, similar to those seen in FD patients, were found in plasma samples from patients with type 1 Gaucher disease [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR25"">25</xref>]. Moreover, some heterozygotes have lyso-Gb3 levels similar to healthy individuals, with a remaining diagnostic gap in women with FD [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR23"">23</xref>, <xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR26"">26</xref>]. Other lysosomal stress situations can induce local production of acid ceramidase from glycosphingolipids and generate sphingoid bases, suggesting that abnormal levels of lyso-Gb3 may be found in the circulation of individuals without the disease [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR27"">27</xref>]. New approaches such as microRNAs [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR28"">28</xref>], circular RNA [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR29"">29</xref>], and metabolomics [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR30"">30</xref>]  have been studied to expand our knowledge and assist in the management of FD, such as correlating genotype to phenotype, identifying the need to start and assess the effectiveness of enzyme replacement therapy (ERT). Jefferies et al. recently used machine learning to promote an algorithm to identify patients at high risk for FD. They used a broad dataset with confirmed FD patients (nearly 5000) and applied it to 1,000,000 patients in medical record data [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR31"">31</xref>]. The vibrational spectroscopy technique provides important information about the biological samples analysed. ATR-FTIR spectroscopy is especially suitable for biofluid analysis because of the evanescence wave generated by the IR source in contrast to other IR techniques [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR7"">7</xref>]. It efficiently detects subtle differences between the samples before significant tissue changes occur. FD biomarkers are limited to the current knowledge of biological disease pathways. The use of a molecular signature to screen for FD overcomes the limitations of unknowing biological pathways that could be involved in complex genetic diseases. The VIP score plot obtained in the PLS-DA indicates the spectral regions that contribute significantly to the classification or discrimination between different groups. In our study, the main wavenumbers responsible for classification were: 1020–1050 cm<sup>-1</sup> C-O stretching; 1140–1175 cm<sup>-1</sup> C–O stretching of tyrosine; 1287–1312 cm<sup>-1</sup> C–N stretching of Amide III; 1490–1700 cm<sup>-1</sup> C = O and C–N stretching of Amide I and II; and 1720–1755 cm<sup>-1</sup> C = O of esters, phospholipids and fatty acids [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR32"">32</xref>]. The ATR-FTIR spectra include biological information in a complex matrix, which can be distinguished <italic toggle=""yes"">via</italic> multivariate analysis. Nevertheless, further studies are required to understand the specific biomarkers of the disease, which may include chromatographic and mass spectrometric techniques, because FTIR spectra can only provide clues about the functional groups associated with the disease and do not provide enough information to identify specific metabolites or molecular markers. A computational algorithm capable of identifying a specific biomolecular signature for a disease with multifactorial clinical conditions has the potential to achieve greater sensitivity than a single biomarker. Our results showed excellent sensitivity in a single test for both sexes, simplifying screening in healthcare services for at-risk populations. It should be noted that although the numbers recruited for this study appear relatively small, FD is classed as a rare disease; in comparison with other studies in the literature to date, this is a large investigation into this condition. Despite some women not presenting symptoms of the disease due to more significant inactivation of the mutant X chromosome, the presence of minimal biological alterations cannot be ruled out. Therefore, using a tool proved capable of detecting subtle differences between samples when associated with appropriate multivariate analysis methods. The absence of individuals with typical FD comorbidities in the control group may have been a limiting factor in the study. The impact of patients without FD, but with left ventricular hypertrophy and chronic kidney disease, for example, should be studied in the future. Another limitation was the predominance of patients with the p.C52F and p.D264Y mutations in the studied population. Therefore, new studies would also need to be carried out to include patients with the late-onset phenotype. Our study is the first to implement the vibrational spectroscopy technique in FD. The difficulty of FD diagnosis and the absence of a screening test, may be supported by the ATR-FTIR spectroscopy associated with multivariate data analysis. An algorithm was built to discriminate between plasma samples from patients with FD and healthy individuals, regardless of gender. Our promising results demonstrate the great potential of this approach in screening for FD, as it is a fast, inexpensive, and minimally invasive technique applicable to both sexes. However, while the results reported herein are promising, future research is required for proof-of-concept and application in an external cohort.

Fabry disease in female monozygotic twins with complex intronic haplotype variants: a case report,,"Fabry disease is a lysosomal storage disease caused by deficiency or dysfunction of lysosomal hydrolase α-galactosidase A, which is attributed to a mutation in the <italic toggle=""yes"">GLA</italic> gene. The main characteristics of Fabry disease are due to the accumulation of substances such as globotriaosylceramide (Gb3), globotriaosylsphingosine (lyso-Gb3), and neutral glycosphingolipids within the lysosomes of various tissues. Over 1000 mutations in the <italic toggle=""yes"">GLA</italic> gene that cause Fabry disease have been identified [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR1"">1</xref>]. In addition, polymorphic <italic toggle=""yes"">GLA</italic> haplotypes or variants of uncertain significance (VUS), including many <italic toggle=""yes"">GLA</italic> intron variants, have been reported [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR2"">2</xref>–<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR5"">5</xref>]. The accurate interpretation of <italic toggle=""yes"">GLA</italic> gene variants is imperative for supporting the clinical diagnosis of Fabry disease and their pathogenic role. Intriguingly, several studies have explored the functional abnormalities of α-galactosidase A enzyme associated with complex intronic haplotype (CIH) mutations [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR6"">6</xref>]. Notably, 5 intronic variants—c − 10 C > T within the 5’UTR and exon 1 (rs2071225), c.369 + 990 C > A within intron 2 (rs1023431), c.370 − 81delCAGCC within intron 2 (rs5903184), c.640–16 A > G within intron 4 (rs2071397), and c.1000–22 C > T within intron 5 (rs2071228)—have been reported in the context of CIH variants [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR6"">6</xref>]. It is important to recognize that mutations within the intronic regions of the <italic toggle=""yes"">GLA</italic> gene are linked to a spectrum of clinical manifestations, such as acroparesthesias, hypohidrosis, heat and cold tolerance, gastrointestinal symptoms, left ventricular hypertrophy, proteinuria, and stroke [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR6"">6</xref>–<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR9"">9</xref>]. However, conventional gene sequencing techniques focused primarily on exons may overlook intronic <italic toggle=""yes"">GLA</italic> variants [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR10"">10</xref>]. Consequently, there is the potential for genetic confirmation to be misinterpreted, leading to an underestimation of the prevalence of Fabry disease [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR11"">11</xref>]. Here, we describe a case of monozygotic female twins who exhibited similar clinical symptoms associated with Fabry disease, which was confirmed by identifying CIH mutations using intronic genetic analysis and lamellate lipid inclusions from kidney biopsy. A 61-year-old woman was referred to our nephrology department for the management of chronic kidney disease. She had a history of stroke, a right internal carotid artery occlusion, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, chronic kidney disease, and chronic hepatitis B. Her chronic hepatitis B was in an inactive carrier state with no evidence of cirrhosis, and she had not received antiviral treatment. She denied having previously experienced pain or paresthesia at the extremities. Two years previously, a kidney biopsy had been performed to evaluate the cause of proteinuria. At that time, light microscopy revealed basement membrane thickening, mesangial matrix widening with focal mesangial cell proliferation, and moderate interstitial fibrosis and tubular atrophy that was diagnosed as chronic glomerulonephritis. Initially, no abnormal findings were described in the EM of the biopsy. After this, her follow-up was discontinued while being treated for a stroke. At the time of her visit, she complained of intermittent lower abdominal cramping, but she did not exhibit acroparesthesia, hypohidrosis, or angiokeratoma. She has not taken any cationic amphiphilic drugs, such as chlorpromazine, amiodarone or chloroquine, which could have caused phospholipidosis. Initial laboratory tests indicated a serum creatinine level of 2.86 mg/dL, an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) of 17.18 mL/min/1.73 m<sup>2</sup>, and a urinary albumin-to-creatinine ratio of 2790.6 mg/g creatinine. Echocardiography showed hypertrophic cardiomyopathy with a left ventricular mass index of 163.5 g/m<sup>2</sup> (normal range < 115 g/m<sup>2</sup>) (Fig. <xref rid=""Fig1"" ref-type=""fig"">1</xref>A and B). Cardiac MRI was not performed. Ophthalmological test did not reveal any abnormal finding. The patient was a monozygotic twin. Her twin sister had histories of atrial flutters, carotid stenosis, proteinuria, left ventricular hypertrophy, and syncope. A family history taking did not reveal any clinical symptoms suggestive of Fabry disease in her parents.

 Considering the progression of nephropathy, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, neurologic symptoms, and her family history with a twin sister, we strongly doubted that the cause was Fabry disease. The α-galactosidase enzyme activity and plasma lyso-Gb3 level were measured, but they were within normal ranges (3.02 µmol/h/L and < 1.00 ng/mL, respectively). However, because α-galactosidase enzyme activity could not be decreased in female patients due to random X-chromosome inactivation, we further analyzed a genetic test for the <italic toggle=""yes"">GLA</italic> gene, including the intronic regions. This analysis revealed the 5 variants of CIH variants within the <italic toggle=""yes"">GLA</italic> gene (c.−10 C > T (rs2071225), c.369 + 990 C > A (rs1023431), c.370–81_370–77delCAGCC (rs5903184), c.640–16 A > G (rs2071397), and c.1000–22 C > T (rs2071228)). Therefore, we reviewed the previous kidney biopsy tissue. Electron microscopy showed lamellated lipid inclusions in podocytes, which were compatible with Fabry disease (Fig. <xref rid=""Fig2"" ref-type=""fig"">2</xref>). Genetic testing of her family confirmed that her monozygotic twin sister and son had the same CIH variants in their <italic toggle=""yes"">GLA</italic> genes (Fig. <xref rid=""Fig3"" ref-type=""fig"">3</xref>). The α-galactosidase enzyme activity twin sister and son were within normal range (5.58 µmol/h/L and 4.92 µmol/h/L, respectively) and plasma lyso-Gb3 level were also normal (< 1.00 ng/mL in both). However, she did not visit our hospital in person, and unfortunately the local hospital did not perform a urine test.

 The patient already had advanced CKD at the time of diagnosis of Fabry disease, but had experienced stroke, had cardiomegaly, and complained of persistent nonspecific abdominal pain. Therefore, we decided to start ERT with 1 mg/kg agalsidase-β every 2 weeks to prevent future cardiovascular complications and improve the patient’s symptoms. Within the early period of ERT, abdominal pain was substantially reduced. During the 2-year of follow-up with ERT, the level of eGFR decreased to 9.87 mL/min/1.73 m<sup>2</sup>. Echocardiography showed no progression of left ventricular hypertrophy and a slightly decreased left ventricular mass index of 152.8 g/m<sup>2</sup> (Fig. <xref rid=""Fig1"" ref-type=""fig"">1</xref>C and D). We followed up the level of lyso-Gb3 every 4–6 months after starting ERT. But the level of lyso-Gb3 did not change and it stayed below the 1.00 ng/mL. However, her monozygotic twin sister refused ERT treatment due to the need for frequent intravenous injections. The follow-up echocardiography of her twin sister after 3 years showed little change in left ventricular hypertrophy from 115.5 to 118.0 g/m<sup>2</sup>, and the eGFR was maintained at 51 mL/min/1.73m<sup>2</sup>. Only a few cases of intronic haplotypes accompanied by classical symptoms of Fabry disease have been reported [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR6"">6</xref>–<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR8"">8</xref>, <xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR10"">10</xref>, <xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR12"">12</xref>–<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR15"">15</xref>]. Fabry disease phenotype-related intronic haplotype variants are rare, and it is unclear whether intronic variants of the <italic toggle=""yes"">GLA</italic> gene correlate with Fabry disease. However, there are several ways that non-coding intronic variants could induce the clinical symptoms of Fabry disease. First, recent studies have demonstrated decreases in GLA enzyme expression in patients with the c.−10 C > T (rs2071225) variant located in the <italic toggle=""yes"">GLA</italic> promoter [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR6"">6</xref>, <xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR12"">12</xref>, <xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR15"">15</xref>]. Similar to our case of CIH variants, mutation of the promoter region can decrease <italic toggle=""yes"">GLA</italic> expression, resulting in classic manifestations of Fabry disease [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR12"">12</xref>, <xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR13"">13</xref>]. Second, intronic variations can affect alternative pre-mRNA splicing. Ishii et al. (10) showed that abnormal splicing in the mid-intronic <italic toggle=""yes"">GLA</italic> mutation of IVS4 + 919 A > G increased the alternatively spliced <italic toggle=""yes"">α-galactosidase A</italic> transcript, resulting in the Fabry cardiac phenotype. In fact, changes in <italic toggle=""yes"">GLA</italic> gene splicing were observed in the two intronic variants of c.370–81_370–77delCAGCC (rs5903184) and c.640–16 A > G (rs2071397) among the patients with CIH mutations [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR6"">6</xref>]. Fabry disease has extensive phenotypic heterogeneity, even within patients with the same variants. The phenotype is probably modified not only by genetic factors but also epigenetics or factors unrelated to <italic toggle=""yes"">GLA</italic> [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR16"">16</xref>]. The c.−10 C > T (rs2071397) variant is situated in a CpG island that contributes to epigenetic mechanisms by being the site of DNA methylation [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR17"">17</xref>]. DNA methylation is a universal epigenetic mechanism for modifying gene expression. Thus, epigenetic changes may aberrantly reduce <italic toggle=""yes"">GLA</italic> gene expression when combined with this prevalent CIH sequence [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR15"">15</xref>]. However, an additive effect of a number of intronic variants has been suggested by a previous report, although it was not conclusive [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR15"">15</xref>]. Intron variants such as CIH variants may not be diagnosed using traditional exon-oriented sequencing. Our patient also had symptoms and clinical manifestations of Fabry disease but had difficulties in diagnosis. All the other GLA polymorphisms that constitute this CIH are relatively close to exon/intron boundaries, with the exception of c.369 + 990 C > A (rs1023431). Their detection in routine Sanger sequencing for the genetic diagnosis of Fabry disease depends on the position of the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) primers used. This variability in primer placement is one of the reasons why this CIH has been inconsistently described in the literature. In patients suspected of having a genetic disease due to a typical course or family history, but for whom an exonic mutation is not found, it may be necessary to perform intronic gene analysis. In recent studies, there have been reports of detecting novel pathogenic intronic variants using long-read sequencing [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR18"">18</xref>]. If such techniques are introduced to diagnosis of Fabry disease, it will explain an important part of the missing heritability even in patients whose causative variants has not been diagnosed using methods such as Sanger sequencing or new generation sequencing. The different clinical course between the twin sisters in our case seems to be understandable in this context. Even if it is not limited to twins, intrafamilial variability is common in Fabry disease, and this is an important cause of delay in diagnosis and treatment of Fabry disease [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR19"">19</xref>]. Therefore, following the diagnosis of Fabry disease, complete family screening is necessary, and it is important to observe the development of clinical symptoms through long-term follow-up. There have been several reported cases of Fabry disease in female monozygotic twins. Discordant phenotypes in females with Fabry disease who have the same variants are explained by an imbalance in maternal and paternal X-chromosome expression. The separation of the fertilized egg into two monozygotes occurs before the second week of embryonic life, with X-chromosome inactivation happening around day 16, in a random basis [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR3"">3</xref>]. Therefore, variable phenotypic expression can be observed in monozygotic female twins with X-linked disorder like Fabry disease [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR2"">2</xref>–<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR4"">4</xref>]. In previously reported cases of female monozygotic twins, the twin sister of the proband typically did not develop clinical symptom of Fabry disease. However, in our case, the monozygotic twin sister of the proband exhibited similar clinical phenotypes, including cardiac, cerebrovascular, and kidney manifestations of Fabry disease. Furthermore, this is the first reported case caused by CIH variants. ERT has long been the main therapeutic strategy for patients with Fabry disease. There have been several case reports of patients with CIH variants treated with ERT [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR7"">7</xref>, <xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR9"">9</xref>, <xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR12"">12</xref>, <xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR20"">20</xref>]. A symptomatic German female − 10T allele carrier started treatment with agalsidase-β, and this led to clinical stabilization of Fabry disease symptoms and a significant reduction in neuropathic pain [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR9"">9</xref>]. Interestingly, reducing the enzyme dose to half resulted in increased pain and reduced physical activity. In another study, two female Spanish patients with 5 CIH variants who presented with cerebrovascular disease and/or acroparesthesias achieved clinical stability after ERT [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR20"">20</xref>]. Our index patient received ERT, while her twin sister did not. Two years of ERT may have stabilized the disease and reduced the abdominal pain in the patient. Therefore, it is necessary to observe how ERT or not having ERT will affect long-term prognoses in these monozygotic twins with the same genetic background. However, in terms of reduction in GFR, a decline in renal function was observed despite ERT, which is presumed to be due to the delayed diagnosis of Fabry disease in this patient and the delayed start of ERT. Wanner et al. reported that the lower baseline eGFR was associated with renal disease progression in women with Fabry disease [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR21"">21</xref>]. Even in patients who underwent ERT, it was reported that the eGFR slope was steeper when baseline renal injury was severe [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR22"">22</xref>]. Our patient had moderate-degree interstitial fibrosis and tubular atrophy observed in a renal biopsy 2 years before diagnosis, and it is presumed that her renal function deteriorated despite ERT. Lastly, the ERT period was relatively short in our patient, so the effect of ERT does not seem to differ dramatically between twins yet, but long-term follow-up is needed in the future. Our study has limitations. First, we could not perform the functional study but there are some results of the previous studies which tested the functional effects of the CIH variants. Gervas-Arruga et al. reported that CIH carriers exhibited altered GLA expression, despite most carriers having high residual enzyme activity [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR6"">6</xref>]. In addition, c.-10 C > T (rs2071225) variant which is located in the promotor region was shown to have decreased protein binding capacity in the EMSA study. Furthermore, Zeevi et al. reported that the patients with intronic variants demonstrated reduced mRNA expression of the GLA gene, suggesting a potential additive effect of these intronic variants [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR15"">15</xref>]. We believe that these findings provide indirect evidence of the functional impact of CIH variants. Second, we were unable to confirm the nature of lamellated lipid inclusions in podocytes observed on EM. However, in previous studies, the accumulation of Gb3 was confirmed through methods such as anti-CD77 fluorescence in skin biopsy specimens of patients or in vitro studies with CIH variants [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR6"">6</xref>, <xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR8"">8</xref>]. Third, despite the various evidence presented in this study and previous studies, it remains unclear whether CIH variants are truly pathogenic. Further research will likely be required, including the continuous accumulation of data on the relationship between intronic variants and phenotypes, as well as the application of new research techniques. Nevertheless, this is the first reported case of female monozygotic twins with CIH variants manifesting cardiac, cerebrovascular, and renal symptoms suggestive of Fabry disease. Our findings suggest that intronic gene analysis may be necessary in patients without exonic variants who exhibit Fabry disease symptoms.",N/A,7 10 2024
Prevalence of Fabry Disease in Patients on Dialysis in France,"Numerous prevalence studies on Fabry disease (FD, OMIM #301500) have been conducted in dialysis populations across the world with variable and controversial results. The FABRYDIAL study aimed to estimate the prevalence of FD in patients aged 18 to 74 years on chronic dialysis in France. This cross-sectional study was conducted in patients undergoing dialysis. One hundred and twenty-four dialysis centers participated. Patients with proven causes of nephropathy unrelated to FD were excluded. Alpha-galactosidase A activity was assayed in men, and both α-galactosidase A and lyso-Gb<sub>3</sub> were assayed in women from dried blood spots. <italic toggle=""yes"">GLA</italic> gene sequencing was performed in case of abnormal values. If a variant was identified, a diagnosis validation committee was consulted for adjudication. Among the 6032 targeted patients, 3088 were included (73.6% of the eligible patients). Biochemical results were available for 2815 (1721 men and 1094 women). A genetic variant of <italic toggle=""yes"">GLA</italic> was identified in five patients: a benign c.937G>T/p.(Asp313Tyr) variant in two individuals, a likely benign c.427G>A/(p.Ala143Thr) variant, a likely benign c.416A>G/(p.Asn139Ser) variant, and a pathogenic c.1185dupG/p.Phe396Glyfs variant. Among the screened patients, the prevalence was 0.058% [0.010;0.328] in males, 0% [0.000;0.350] in females, and 0.035% [0.006;0.201] when both genders were pooled. Among all patients aged 18–74 years undergoing dialysis without a previously known cause of nephropathy unlinked to FD, the prevalence was 0.028% [0.006;0.121]. The prevalence of FD in a cohort of French dialysis patients was low. However, considering the prognostic impact of earlier diagnosis, signs of FD should be sought in patients with nephropathies of uncertain etiology.","Fabry Disease (FD, OMIM #301500) is an X-linked lysosomal disease due to pathogenic variants in the <italic toggle=""yes"">GLA</italic> gene encoding for α-galactosidase A. It results in the accumulation of globotriaosylceramide (Gb<sub>3</sub>) and its deacetylated derivative (lyso-Gb<sub>3</sub>) in fluids and cellular lysosomes [<xref rid=""B1-ijms-25-10104"" ref-type=""bibr"">1</xref>]. It is characterized by a wide phenotypic spectrum. In classic FD, patients typically exhibit neuropathic pain, angiokeratomas, hypohidrosis, gastrointestinal dysfunction, and <italic toggle=""yes"">Cornea verticillata</italic> from childhood or adolescence [<xref rid=""B1-ijms-25-10104"" ref-type=""bibr"">1</xref>], but these early indicative signs are inconsistent [<xref rid=""B2-ijms-25-10104"" ref-type=""bibr"">2</xref>,<xref rid=""B3-ijms-25-10104"" ref-type=""bibr"">3</xref>].

Therefore, the estimated prevalence of FD in many previous screening studies is questionable, and its generalizability to the population undergoing dialysis in France remains controversial. The aim of the FABRYDIAL study was to estimate the prevalence of FD in a large cohort of French patients undergoing chronic dialysis aged 18 to 74 years. We also aimed to describe the phenotype of patients who harbor a <italic toggle=""yes"">GLA</italic> variant.  The FABRYDIAL study aimed to estimate the prevalence of FD in patients aged 18 to 74 years undergoing chronic dialysis in France. A total of 124 dialysis centers participated in the study, and 3088 patients were included. Biological samples were available for 2815 patients, namely the α-Gal A activity in men and both α-Gal A and lyso-Gb<sub>3</sub> in women. Among the cases with first-tier abnormal result(s) in whom <italic toggle=""yes"">GLA</italic> gene sequencing was performed, five patients were found to have a <italic toggle=""yes"">GLA</italic> genetic variant. After analysis by the DVC, only one male was considered to have FD. Among the patients included in the study and screened (2815 patients), the prevalence of FD was 0.058% [0.010;0.328] in males, 0% [0.000;0.350] in females, and 0.035% [0.006;0.201] in whatever the gender. Among all the patients aged 18 to 74 years undergoing chronic dialysis, the prevalence was estimated at 0.016%. Many studies have been conducted to estimate the prevalence of FD in ESRD patients (<xref rid=""ijms-25-10104-t003"" ref-type=""table"">Table 3</xref>) [<xref rid=""B6-ijms-25-10104"" ref-type=""bibr"">6</xref>,<xref rid=""B7-ijms-25-10104"" ref-type=""bibr"">7</xref>,<xref rid=""B8-ijms-25-10104"" ref-type=""bibr"">8</xref>,<xref rid=""B9-ijms-25-10104"" ref-type=""bibr"">9</xref>,<xref rid=""B10-ijms-25-10104"" ref-type=""bibr"">10</xref>,<xref rid=""B11-ijms-25-10104"" ref-type=""bibr"">11</xref>,<xref rid=""B12-ijms-25-10104"" ref-type=""bibr"">12</xref>,<xref rid=""B13-ijms-25-10104"" ref-type=""bibr"">13</xref>,<xref rid=""B14-ijms-25-10104"" ref-type=""bibr"">14</xref>,<xref rid=""B15-ijms-25-10104"" ref-type=""bibr"">15</xref>,<xref rid=""B16-ijms-25-10104"" ref-type=""bibr"">16</xref>,<xref rid=""B17-ijms-25-10104"" ref-type=""bibr"">17</xref>,<xref rid=""B18-ijms-25-10104"" ref-type=""bibr"">18</xref>,<xref rid=""B19-ijms-25-10104"" ref-type=""bibr"">19</xref>,<xref rid=""B20-ijms-25-10104"" ref-type=""bibr"">20</xref>,<xref rid=""B21-ijms-25-10104"" ref-type=""bibr"">21</xref>,<xref rid=""B22-ijms-25-10104"" ref-type=""bibr"">22</xref>,<xref rid=""B23-ijms-25-10104"" ref-type=""bibr"">23</xref>,<xref rid=""B24-ijms-25-10104"" ref-type=""bibr"">24</xref>], but most have limitations [<xref rid=""B39-ijms-25-10104"" ref-type=""bibr"">39</xref>,<xref rid=""B40-ijms-25-10104"" ref-type=""bibr"">40</xref>,<xref rid=""B41-ijms-25-10104"" ref-type=""bibr"">41</xref>].

The present study offers an approach that is both economically viable and scientifically valid, using a sensitive biological screening in women and a diagnostic algorithm consistent with recent data [<xref rid=""B30-ijms-25-10104"" ref-type=""bibr"">30</xref>,<xref rid=""B53-ijms-25-10104"" ref-type=""bibr"">53</xref>,<xref rid=""B54-ijms-25-10104"" ref-type=""bibr"">54</xref>]. Another limitation of previously published studies is the frequent lack of distinction between benign and pathogenic variants of <italic toggle=""yes"">GLA</italic> [<xref rid=""B41-ijms-25-10104"" ref-type=""bibr"">41</xref>,<xref rid=""B42-ijms-25-10104"" ref-type=""bibr"">42</xref>,<xref rid=""B43-ijms-25-10104"" ref-type=""bibr"">43</xref>,<xref rid=""B44-ijms-25-10104"" ref-type=""bibr"">44</xref>,<xref rid=""B45-ijms-25-10104"" ref-type=""bibr"">45</xref>,<xref rid=""B50-ijms-25-10104"" ref-type=""bibr"">50</xref>,<xref rid=""B51-ijms-25-10104"" ref-type=""bibr"">51</xref>], which can lead to overestimating the prevalence by up to 50% [<xref rid=""B25-ijms-25-10104"" ref-type=""bibr"">25</xref>]. Finally, in countries in which there is no free access to dialysis, FD prevalence could be biased. According to a meta-analysis, the prevalence of FD in dialysis is around 0.21% in men and 0.15% in women [<xref rid=""B25-ijms-25-10104"" ref-type=""bibr"">25</xref>], much higher than the prevalence measured in the present study. When limiting the scope to studies in European populations of at least 1000 patients, all were carried out prior to 2008, and the prevalence they measured varied from 0.26% to 0.42% in men [<xref rid=""B3-ijms-25-10104"" ref-type=""bibr"">3</xref>,<xref rid=""B12-ijms-25-10104"" ref-type=""bibr"">12</xref>,<xref rid=""B14-ijms-25-10104"" ref-type=""bibr"">14</xref>]. More recently published studies unrelated to Europe have observed similar results, except for the Japanese J-FAST study [<xref rid=""B28-ijms-25-10104"" ref-type=""bibr"">28</xref>] and the Australian aCQuiRE study [<xref rid=""B38-ijms-25-10104"" ref-type=""bibr"">38</xref>], which both measured a prevalence of 0.02% [<xref rid=""B28-ijms-25-10104"" ref-type=""bibr"">28</xref>,<xref rid=""B38-ijms-25-10104"" ref-type=""bibr"">38</xref>], close to that found in the present study. Among the hypotheses that may explain the low prevalence found in the present study was the fact that a previously known diagnosis of FD would have been an exclusion criterion. However, investigators had to request the inclusion of patients for whom FD was confirmed, and an analysis of the data of the National Dialysis Registry (Registre Epidémiologie et Information en Néphrologie, REIN [<xref rid=""B55-ijms-25-10104"" ref-type=""bibr"">55</xref>]) did not identify any patients with previously diagnosed FD among the screened patients, suggesting that no patient with a known diagnosis of FD was excluded. The low prevalence could also be due to a lack of sensitivity, as measuring α-GalA on dried blood carries a risk of false negatives [<xref rid=""B16-ijms-25-10104"" ref-type=""bibr"">16</xref>]; however, in our study, the α-GalA threshold was set high, so this risk was negligible in men. In women, the risk of having both α-GalA and lyso-Gb<sub>3</sub> in the normal ranges along with ESRD due to FD is also likely negligible [<xref rid=""B3-ijms-25-10104"" ref-type=""bibr"">3</xref>,<xref rid=""B30-ijms-25-10104"" ref-type=""bibr"">30</xref>,<xref rid=""B42-ijms-25-10104"" ref-type=""bibr"">42</xref>,<xref rid=""B43-ijms-25-10104"" ref-type=""bibr"">43</xref>]. However, cases of later-onset Fabry disease with high residual enzyme activity in heterozygote females in association with a coincident kidney disease leading to ESRD could have been missed. Alternatively, the prevalence in this study could reflect reality more accurately than in previous studies. Our approach aggregated phenotypic, biological, and genetic data, thereby avoiding over-diagnosing FD. As an example, thorough phenotype-genotype correlation allowed us to consider a patient with a likely benign variant (p.Asn139Ser), initially suspected to be associated with the later-onset cardiac phenotype of FD, as non-FD. In the only diagnosed case of FD in this study, suggestive early signs and family history had been overlooked prior to the study. However, after examination, the FD-expert physician (DPG) identified a suggestive familial and personal history. The diagnosis led to the initiation of specific therapy and family screening [<xref rid=""B56-ijms-25-10104"" ref-type=""bibr"">56</xref>]. This case emphasizes the importance of searching for a suggestive family history [<xref rid=""B56-ijms-25-10104"" ref-type=""bibr"">56</xref>,<xref rid=""B57-ijms-25-10104"" ref-type=""bibr"">57</xref>] and the need for nephrologists to be trained in recognizing the physical signs of FD, in particular when the etiology of the nephropathy is unknown. This study has several limitations, including the absence of participation of all French dialysis centers, the restriction to dialyzed patients rather than to all ESRD patients, a high rate (26.4%) of non-included eligible patients, and the lack of data related to such patients, especially regarding their gender. More importantly, diagnosis in female Fabry patients may have been missed since a recent large retrospective study conducted on 827 patients (374 males and 453 females), all with a causative variant in the <italic toggle=""yes"">GLA</italic> gene, showed that while 100% of male patients had an α-GalA activity lower than the reference value, regardless of the phenotype, more than 70% of female patients had normal enzyme activity, both with the classic variant and with late-onset variants. Those female patients would, therefore, escape diagnosis if the enzymatic test alone was used [<xref rid=""B58-ijms-25-10104"" ref-type=""bibr"">58</xref>]. Similarly, 42% of females with a pathogenic variant in <italic toggle=""yes"">GLA</italic> had normal plasma lyso-Gb3 values with a significant difference between subjects with the classic variant compared to patients with a later-onset form of the disease [<xref rid=""B45-ijms-25-10104"" ref-type=""bibr"">45</xref>,<xref rid=""B58-ijms-25-10104"" ref-type=""bibr"">58</xref>]. In the case of classic Fabry disease, 83% of female patients had pathological values of plasma LysoGb3, meaning that using this test for diagnosis, up to 17% of female patients could, in theory, have been missed [<xref rid=""B58-ijms-25-10104"" ref-type=""bibr"">58</xref>]. However, previous studies in female patients with Fabry disease have shown a strong correlation between low alpha-galactosidase activity (in association with a highly skewed X inactivation profile) and progression to end-stage renal disease, thereby highly reducing the risk of a false negative in our study population [<xref rid=""B8-ijms-25-10104"" ref-type=""bibr"">8</xref>,<xref rid=""B9-ijms-25-10104"" ref-type=""bibr"">9</xref>]. The strengths of the present study advocate for the scientific relevance of its results. The screening was conducted in a country where the national healthcare system covers the costs of dialysis, reducing patient selection bias. It relied on data from a nationwide dialysis database (REIN) [<xref rid=""B55-ijms-25-10104"" ref-type=""bibr"">55</xref>,<xref rid=""B59-ijms-25-10104"" ref-type=""bibr"">59</xref>]. Patients’ screening was limited to patients dialyzed on a single date, according to the strict definition of prevalence. The protocol requested the inclusion of previously diagnosed FD patients in order to measure the prevalence of FD and not of “undiagnosed-FD”. The diagnostic sensitivity was enhanced thanks to a systematic dosage of lyso-Gb<sub>3</sub> in addition to the α-Gal assay in women. Finally, the DVC reduced the risk of over-diagnosis of FD through the exclusion of non-pathogenic <italic toggle=""yes"">GLA</italic> variants [<xref rid=""B41-ijms-25-10104"" ref-type=""bibr"">41</xref>,<xref rid=""B42-ijms-25-10104"" ref-type=""bibr"">42</xref>,<xref rid=""B43-ijms-25-10104"" ref-type=""bibr"">43</xref>,<xref rid=""B44-ijms-25-10104"" ref-type=""bibr"">44</xref>,<xref rid=""B45-ijms-25-10104"" ref-type=""bibr"">45</xref>,<xref rid=""B50-ijms-25-10104"" ref-type=""bibr"">50</xref>,<xref rid=""B51-ijms-25-10104"" ref-type=""bibr"">51</xref>]. In conclusion, the FABRYDIAL study aimed at estimating the prevalence of FD in patients aged 18 to 74 years undergoing chronic dialysis in France. Among the 2815 patients with available biological data, one patient was diagnosed with FD, leading to an estimated prevalence of 0.036% [0.006;0.201], 0.058% in men [0.01;0.328], and 0% in women [0;0.35]. When considering patients who were not included due to a previously known cause of nephropathy unlinked to FD, the prevalence in this population was lower, 0.028% [0.006;0.121].

2024 Update of the TSOC Expert Consensus of Fabry Disease
","
As an X-linked inherited lysosomal storage disease that is caused by α-galactosidase A gene variants resulting in progressive accumulation of pathogenic glycosphingolipid (Gb3) accumulation in multiple tissues and organs, Fabry disease (FD) can be classified into classic or late-onset phenotypes. In classic phenotype patients, α-galactosidase A activity is absent or severely reduced, resulting in a more progressive disease course with multi-systemic involvement. Conversely, late-onset phenotype, often with missense variants (e.g., IVS4+919G>A) in Taiwan, may present with a more chronic clinical course with predominant cardiac involvement (cardiac subtype), as they tend to have residual enzyme activity, remaining asymptomatic or clinically silent during childhood and adolescence. In either form, cardiac hypertrophy remains the most common feature of cardiac involvement, potentially leading to myocardial fibrosis, arrhythmias, and heart failure. Diagnosis is established through α-galactosidase enzyme activity assessment or biomarker analyisis (globotriaosylsphingosine, Lyso-Gb3), advanced imaging modalities (echocardiography and cardiac magnetic resonance imaging), and genotyping to differentiate FD from other cardiomyopathy. Successful therapeutic response relies on early recognition and by disease awareness from typical features in classic phenotype and cardiac red flags in cardiac variants for timely therapeutic interventions. Recent advances in pharmacological approach including enzyme replacement therapy (agalsidase alfa or beta), oral chaperone therapy (migalastat), and substrate reduction therapy (venglustat) aim to prevent from irreversible organ damage. Genotype- and gender-based monitoring of treatment effects through biomarker (Lyso-Gb3), renal assessment, and cardiac responses using advanced imaging modalities are key steps to optimizing patient care in FD.

Screening for Fabry disease in patients on Hemodialysis,,"Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a gradually progressive disease that has serious social, financial, and health implications. When a nephrologist declares a patient suffering from end stage renal disease (ESRD), it is devastating news for the patient and his family. There is a significant proportion of patients that are initiated on hemodialysis (HD) without a firm diagnosis. The two major registries the European Renal Association–European Dialysis and Transplant Association[<xref rid=""R1"" ref-type=""bibr"">1</xref>] and the United States Renal Data System[<xref rid=""R2"" ref-type=""bibr"">2</xref>] have mentioned that 27% and 22% of patients respectively are put on dialysis with the basic diagnosis as unknown. Inherited kidney diseases (IKDs) remain largely undiagnosed[<xref rid=""R3"" ref-type=""bibr"">3</xref>] in the adult population, being more common in the pediatric age group. Adult nephrologists are not perceptive enough to suspect and in turn, diagnose genetic diseases effectively. Although the incidence of individual IKD may be low but collectively as a cohort, they weigh about 10% of adult patients on HD[<xref rid=""R4"" ref-type=""bibr"">4</xref>] and majority of pediatric patients on HD. Fabry disease is one of the IKDs, which is an under-recognized, X-linked recessive, lysosomal storage disorder and results from deficient activity of the enzyme a-galactosidase (a-Gal A). The first description of this disease was given by Fabry[<xref rid=""R5"" ref-type=""bibr"">5</xref>] and Anderson[<xref rid=""R6"" ref-type=""bibr"">6</xref>] in 1898. Since then, the understanding of this disease has evolved from being a mere dermatological disorder to a progressive multisystem disease. The incidence[<xref rid=""R7"" ref-type=""bibr"">7</xref>] of Fabry disease has been estimated at one in 40,000 to one in 117,000 and there is no ethnic or racial predisposition. Various studies[<xref rid=""R8"" ref-type=""bibr"">8</xref><xref rid=""R9"" ref-type=""bibr"">9</xref>] worldwide have reported variable prevalence of Fabry disease in high-risk populations such as dialysis. There are no studies from India on its prevalence. Depending on the group of patients screened, the range of prevalence has been 0.2%–1.2% in patients on HD[<xref rid=""R10"" ref-type=""bibr"">10</xref>] and as high as 3%–4% in adult male patients with cryptogenic stroke[<xref rid=""R11"" ref-type=""bibr"">11</xref>] and unexplained LVH.[<xref rid=""R12"" ref-type=""bibr"">12</xref>] The deficiency of the enzyme a-Gal A leads to the accumulation of its substrates, typically Globotriaosylceramide (Gb3) and galactosylceramide in vast variety of tissues lysosomes.[<xref rid=""R13"" ref-type=""bibr"">13</xref>] This multifarious deposition of Gb3 leads to cellular dysfunction and fibrosis at various levels and leads to protean manifestations and multisystem involvement[<xref rid=""R14"" ref-type=""bibr"">14</xref>] of predominantly cardiovascular, renal, and central nervous systems. The X-linked inheritance results in broadly three typical clinical scenarios of the disease. The Classical disease, being substantially more common in males[<xref rid=""R15"" ref-type=""bibr"">15</xref>] presents early in childhood with features of acroparaesthesias, angiokeratomas, hypohidrosis, characteristic corneal and lenticular opacities, and proteinuria. In other scenarios of heterozygous females, symptoms may vary from either asymptomatic to a less severe pattern or full-blown disease. Third scenarios is of late-onset variants of either cardiac or renal variants in which the presence of residual enzyme activity[<xref rid=""R13"" ref-type=""bibr"">13</xref>] of more than 5%–10% delays phenotypic expression. The gene coding A Gal A has been well studied[<xref rid=""R16"" ref-type=""bibr"">16</xref>] and localized to chromosomal region Xq22. To date, more than 1000 variants have been described[<xref rid=""R17"" ref-type=""bibr"">17</xref>] with most mutations being restricted within a single family and de novo mutations are rare. The diagnosis in male patients speculated to have Fabry disease is confirmed by measuring a gal activity assay[<xref rid=""R18"" ref-type=""bibr"">18</xref>] either using plasma samples, peripheral blood leucocytes, or a simple dried blood spot (DBS). In female patients, measuring enzyme activity can be unreliable;[<xref rid=""R19"" ref-type=""bibr"">19</xref>] hence, gene sequencing and identification of disease-causing mutation are required to confirm the diagnosis. Out of several treatment approaches,[<xref rid=""R20"" ref-type=""bibr"">20</xref>] the one that is widely available is the enzyme replacement therapy to be given as biweekly infusions lifelong. It is ultra-expensive and formidable therapy for many. This study was conducted for 2 years, at the dialysis center of a tertiary care hospital in North India. The hospital caters to defense personnel and their dependent family members, from various districts in Punjab, Himachal Pradesh, and Jammu and Kashmir states. The department provides comprehensive nephrology care to CKD patients at all stages of CKD. The patients are offered renal replacement therapy as and when they reach ESRD. The choice of RRT such as dialysis (HD or peritoneal dialysis) and renal transplantation is discussed with each patient before initiating the therapy. Kidney transplant is not being done at this center and patients who are willing and have prospective donors are referred to other transplant centers for further management. This center has a workload of approximately 60 patients on regular HD and every month 5–7 New patients are initiated on HD. The aim was to screen all patients for Fabry disease and identify its potential associated factors. This was an observational, prospective study, undertaken on all patients diagnosed with ESRD and were undergoing dialysis at our hospital or initiated on dialysis between March 2020 and June 2022. The study was approved by the Institutional Ethics Committee. Informed written consent was obtained from all participants. Good clinical care guidelines and guidelines as per the Declaration of Helsinki were followed. The patients were classified into different clinical diagnosis based on history, investigations, and kidney biopsy wherever indicated. The high-risk features suggestive of genetic diseases, and in particular for Fabry disease, were noted. Blood samples were taken from all patients undergoing HD irrespective of their clinical diagnosis. One drop of blood per circle on DBS card was applied with caution that it covers the whole circle on the inside. These cards were then dried at room temperature for 4 h and stored at 2°C –8°C. Further, they were sent for analysis to the Sir Ganga Ram Hospital in New Delhi by courier. The DBSs were analyzed using a fluorescence-based high throughput microplate method. The BSS test result was defined as positive if the α-Gal A activity was found below the threshold of 3 nmol/h/ml, which represents approximately 30% of the α-Gal A activity in healthy controls. All patients, whose enzyme levels were lower than the lower prescribed range, were subjected to mutations study after repeat written informed consent and requisite counseling. The sample for mutation analysis was collected in Heparin tube (3 mL) and was sent to Med Genome Laboratory, Bengaluru. The suggested Schematic flow chart to diagnose Fabry disease is shown in <xref rid=""ijabmr.ijabmr_161_24-f001"" ref-type=""fig"">Figure 1</xref>. Patients were divided into four age groups as shown in <xref rid=""ijabmr.ijabmr_161_24-t001"" ref-type=""table"">Table 1</xref>. Mean age of the patients was 52.44 ± 14.6 years, maximum number of patients, 42%, was in 46–60 years, and majority of the patients, 64.3% were males. Patients with diabetic kidney disease and presumed Contrast-induced nephropathy CKD (CIN CKD) were 24.6%, the most common clinical diagnosis [<xref rid=""ijabmr.ijabmr_161_24-t001"" ref-type=""table"">Table 1</xref>]. The DBS test was done on 112 patients, and it revealed that 19 patients had low enzyme activity. Out of the 19 patients, 6 were females, and subsequently, one of them was found to be positive for mutation pathogenic for Fabry disease, as shown in <xref rid=""ijabmr.ijabmr_161_24-f002"" ref-type=""fig"">Figure 2</xref>. The 19 patients (13 males, 6 females) who were DBS positive were further studied [<xref rid=""ijabmr.ijabmr_161_24-t002"" ref-type=""table"">Table 2</xref>]. The mean age of onset of renal dysfunction was 46.11 ± 16 years and the majority of them were males (68%). The most common diagnosis was diabetic kidney disease (26%), followed by presumed chronic glomerulonephritis CKD (21%) and presumed CIN CKD (21%). Amongst the DBS-positive patients, 15.8% had a history of consanguineous marriage and 10.5% had family history of kidney disease. Patients with positive DBS tests were further compared for any association with typical features of Fabry disease [<xref rid=""ijabmr.ijabmr_161_24-t003"" ref-type=""table"">Table 3</xref>]. It was found that of the positive DBS test, 21.1% had reported pain/paresthesia in hands and feet as compared to 11.8% among those with negative DBS test (<italic toggle=""yes"">P</italic> = 0.282). Similarly, intolerance to heat was 15.8% versus 9.7% (<italic toggle=""yes"">P</italic> = 0.433), history of CVA was 10.5% versus 8.6% (<italic toggle=""yes"">P</italic> = 0.677), and LVH on ECG was 42.1% versus 22.6% (<italic toggle=""yes"">P</italic> = 0.077); but none of these associations were found to be statistically significant Out of 19 patients with low enzyme activity, the study found one confirmed case of Fabry disease on mutation analysis. The mutation was a heterozygous missense variation in exon 7 of the GLA gene (p.Arg363His). The patient confirmed to have Fabry disease was an 82-years-old female. The pedigree chart of the index patient is shown in <xref rid=""ijabmr.ijabmr_161_24-f003"" ref-type=""fig"">Figure 3</xref>. The diagnosis of Fabry disease is often delayed for many years due to diverse phenotypes, and it is an underrecognized cause of renal failure in the dialysis population. Hence, many guidelines[<xref rid=""R21"" ref-type=""bibr"">21</xref>] have now included the screening of Fabry disease as one of the recommendations. This is the first precision medicine screening study for Fabry disease in India. In this study, of the 112 patients on dialysis, only one was a confirmed patient of Fabry disease. The 112 patients were divided into four age groups, and it was found that majority of the patients were in the age group of 46–60 years. Similar result was also seen in large Indian CKD study[<xref rid=""R22"" ref-type=""bibr"">22</xref>] which found the mean age of patients suffering from mild-to-moderate CKD across 11 centers in India to be 50.3 ± 11.3 years. It is a matter of concern that the most productive age group is crippled with the burden of dialysis. In our study, the predominant cause of ESRD was Diabetic kidney disease and Presumed CIN CKD (24.1%). These results are congruent with other Indian studies[<xref rid=""R22"" ref-type=""bibr"">22</xref><xref rid=""R23"" ref-type=""bibr"">23</xref><xref rid=""R24"" ref-type=""bibr"">24</xref>] which also found the diabetes as leading cause of ESRD. There are various methods to screen for Fabry disease. Screening studies worldwide have used different assays, which include either plasma/whole blood based or leukocytes or DBS method. In this study, the DBS method has been used. In one of the largest prospective screening studies[<xref rid=""R8"" ref-type=""bibr"">8</xref>] (<italic toggle=""yes"">n</italic> = 9604) using DBS samples of all male patients undergoing HD in Argentina, Frabasil <italic toggle=""yes"">et al</italic>. [<xref rid=""ijabmr.ijabmr_161_24-t004"" ref-type=""table"">Table 4</xref>] confirmed 22 undiagnosed Fabry disease cases and concluded the prevalence rate of 0.23% for Fabry disease in HD population. Similarly, other studies[<xref rid=""R8"" ref-type=""bibr"">8</xref><xref rid=""R9"" ref-type=""bibr"">9</xref><xref rid=""R10"" ref-type=""bibr"">10</xref><xref rid=""R25"" ref-type=""bibr"">25</xref><xref rid=""R26"" ref-type=""bibr"">26</xref><xref rid=""R27"" ref-type=""bibr"">27</xref>] have found the prevalence rate of Fabry disease in the HD population to be ranging from 0.16% to 0.58%. This study found 19 patients with enzyme activity lesser than the normal range, of which 13 were males and 6 were females. However, the mutation analysis confirmed only one patient with Fabry disease, making the prevalence of Fabry disease 0.89% in this study, which is more than the frequency observed in other studies mentioned in <xref rid=""ijabmr.ijabmr_161_24-t004"" ref-type=""table"">Table 4</xref>. Our results are congruent with studies[<xref rid=""R8"" ref-type=""bibr"">8</xref><xref rid=""R9"" ref-type=""bibr"">9</xref>] that support the potential benefit of screening Fabry disease in high-risk population such as dialysis. In contrast, the Dutch study by Linthorst <italic toggle=""yes"">et al</italic>.[<xref rid=""R28"" ref-type=""bibr"">28</xref>] has advised to use caution for screening Fabry disease in view of lacunae in the screening tests and the paucity of treatment options subsequently. Fabry disease can be diagnosed in affected males by demonstrating a deficiency of α-galactosidase A enzyme in plasma samples, leukocytes, or DBS fairly accurately, However, enzyme assay is an unreliable test for females.[<xref rid=""R19"" ref-type=""bibr"">19</xref>] In our study, 13 males and 6 females (total 19) patients had low enzyme activity on DBS. However, the mutation testing confirmed FD in only one female patient. Similar result was seen in nationwide Screening study[<xref rid=""R9"" ref-type=""bibr"">9</xref>] which reported 117 positive DBS patients and only 4 confirmed FD cases subsequently. In contrast,[<xref rid=""R8"" ref-type=""bibr"">8</xref>] this study confirmed 22 Fabry disease patients out of 24 patients with Positive DBS test. Overall DBS is accepted as an effective screening method in males; however, it should be supplemented with Lyso Gb3 levels and mutation analysis in suspected patients.[<xref rid=""R29"" ref-type=""bibr"">29</xref>] The mutation that was found in this study was heterozygous missense variation in exon 7 of the GLA gene (p.Arg363His). This particular mutation has earlier been reported from India[<xref rid=""R30"" ref-type=""bibr"">30</xref>] and Argentina[<xref rid=""R31"" ref-type=""bibr"">31</xref>] where it was seen in late-onset renal variants suggesting genotype phenotype correlation. Out of 112 patients on dialysis, this study found one confirmed patient of Fabry disease.

Experts’ Opinion in Fabry Disease Management and the Unmet Medical Need: The Saudi Perspective,"Fabry disease (FD) is an X-linked lysosomal storage disorder caused by α-galactosidase A gene mutations. Its global incidence ranges from 1:40,000 to 1:170,000. This expert review evaluates the available guidelines, the status of diagnosed but untreated patients with FD, and the challenges in diagnosing and managing FD in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA). An advisory board meeting (ABM) was conducted in two phases, with a survey that aimed to receive insights on the current unmet needs in the management of patients with FD in November 2022, and a second, offline meeting in February 2023. The goal of this ABM was to discuss current unmet needs in the management of Fabry patients in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. In the first ABM, experts opined on the best practices in the diagnosis, screening, and management of FD for healthcare professionals. These opinions on the management of FD relied on data from research and expert clinical judgments. In the second ABM, the same panel discussed different aspects of FD diagnosis, treatment, and management in the member countries of the Gulf Cooperation Council. The experts discussed the stigma associated with FD, patient awareness and knowledge, genetic screening, biomarkers, and home infusion therapy. They reviewed international guidelines and clinical criteria for enzyme replacement therapy (ERT). Furthermore, they also discussed the diagnosis of FD in men and women, the current guidelines followed for monitoring patients with FD, monitoring untreated patients with FD, Fabry Stabilization IndeX (FASTEX) as an assessment tool for the diagnosis of FD, FD management in KSA, challenges encountered while prescribing ERT in patients with FD, and the clinical criteria for starting ERT. The discussions led to the conclusion that currently, ERT is the only available therapy to manage FD and research should be focused on the early diagnosis and management of FD.","Fabry disease (FD) is an X-linked, multisystem, lysosomal storage disorder that is caused by pathogenic mutations in the α-galactosidase A gene (<italic toggle=""yes"">GLA</italic>), which results in deficient/undetectable α-galactosidase A (α-Gal-A) activity and increasing lysosomal buildup of globotriaosylceramide (Gb-3).

A panel of FD experts gathered to opine on the management of FD based on their practical experience and available high-level evidence. The opinions provided by the experts will aid medical personnel in establishing screening standards and developing strategies for treating men and women with FD. The meeting was planned in two phases, with the first meeting being conducted virtually in November 2022, and the second conducted in person in February 2023. At the first advisory board meeting (ABM), eight questions were discussed by a panel of eight experts. A literature analysis of studies published on FD in pediatric and adult populations, as well as suggestions from current guidelines were critically reviewed by the panel. The literature selection process involved a review of peer-reviewed articles, clinical guidelines, and expert opinions relevant to FD. The search strategy included databases such as PubMed, MEDLINE, and Cochrane Library. Articles were selected based on their relevance to the diagnosis, treatment, and management of FD, particularly in the context of KSA. The search terms employed included combinations of keywords such as “Fabry Disease”, “enzyme replacement therapy”, “genetic screening”, “clinical management”, “diagnosis”, “treatment guidelines”, and “Saudi Arabia”. The discussion points were chosen based on their relevance to the current challenges and unmet needs in the diagnosis and management of FD in the KSA. These points were identified through preliminary expert consultations and a review of existing literature, ensuring that they reflect the issues faced by healthcare professionals in this region. In the second ABM, the same panel of eight experts discussed the diagnosis, treatment, and management of FD in the member countries of the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC). Key insights from the first ABM were also presented to the panel of experts. The second ABM focused on the following domains:

After the ABMs the experts decided that their opinions must be summarized into a manuscript to provide healthcare professionals (HCPs) with a list of best practices for FD diagnosis, screening, and management. The experts’ opinions were based on evidence from published literature and the clinical expertise of the HCPs.  The expert panel suggested that spreading awareness about FD in the KSA and educating the general population about the disease is of utmost importance. In the KSA, it would be desirable to create a database and establish a research center for FD, to differentiate between classical and late-onset FD, and to identify phenotype-genotype correlations to aid in the early diagnosis and management of FD. Family and newborn screening, and consultation with a clinical geneticist have been suggested for early identification of FD. Early treatment with ERT must be initiated to prevent disease progression in FD patients. ERT is the only available therapy for managing FD in the KSA and the Middle East, with agalsidase-alfa and agalsidase-beta being the available ERTs in KSA. Additionally, referral to multispecialty care is desired. Furthermore, the use of the FASTEX tool should be encouraged to facilitate the monitoring of patients with FD staying untreated.",N/A,13 9 2024
Fabry disease: a rare disorder calling for personalized medicine,"Fabry Disease (FD) is a genetic disease caused by a deficiency in the activity of lysosomal galactosidase A (α-GalA), an enzyme responsible for the catabolism of globotriaosylceramide (Gb3). Since lysosomes are present throughout the body and play a crucial role in catabolism and recycling of cytosolic compounds, FD can affect multiple organs and result in various symptoms, including renal, cardiovascular, neurological, cutaneous, and ophthalmic manifestations. Due to the nonspecific symptoms and the rarity of FD, it is often diagnosed late in life. However, introducing targeted therapies such as enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) and chaperone therapy has significantly improved FD's natural history and prognosis by restoring α-GalA enzyme activity. Despite the advancements, there are limitations to the currently available therapies, which has prompted research into new potential treatments for FD, including alternative forms of enzyme replacement therapy, substrate reduction therapy, mRNA therapy, and genetic therapy. In this review, we analyze the epidemiology, pathophysiology, and treatment of FD, with particular emphasis on promising therapeutic opportunities that could shift the treatment of this rare disease from a standardized to a personalized approach soon.","Fabry Disease (FD) is a rare X-linked genetic disease characterized by the reduced activity of lysosomal galactosidase A (α-GalA), a key enzyme involved in globotriaosylceramide (Gb3) catabolism. The ubiquitous presence of lysosomes, central to the breakdown and recycling of cellular materials, means that FD's impact is widespread, affecting numerous organs and presenting a spectrum of phenotypes shaped by the extent of renal, cardiovascular, neurological, skin, and eye involvement[<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR1"">1</xref>]. Clinically, FD manifests primarily in two forms: the early-onset “classic form” and the attenuated (so-called atypical or late) form. The classic variant is marked by negligible or low (< 1%) α-GalA activity, leading to early and extensive multi-organ complications. In contrast, the attenuated form emerges later in life with variable manifestations contingent on the remaining α-GalA activity levels. Notably, female carriers might experience a disease burden comparable to males or may remain symptom-free, depending on the nature of the GLA mutation and on the X chromosome inactivation (lyonization) that increases phenotypic variability [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR2"">2</xref>]. In recent years, significant advances have been observed in the comprehension of FD, from pathogenesis to natural history, which has led to increased awareness and new diagnoses. Early detection of FD is essential, considering the progressive accumulation of Gb3 in the target organs. It allows for early disease staging and prompts tailored therapy to avoid organ damage. For example, a multidisciplinary team, which may include nephrologists, cardiologists, neurologists, ophthalmologists, and geneticists, is required for patient evaluation and assessment of disease progression risk. Prognostic scores like FASTEX, MSSI, and DS3 [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR1"">1</xref>–<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR3"">3</xref>], combining clinical, radiological, and laboratory information, are available for patients’ follow-up over time and to evaluate the stability or progression of the pathology [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR4"">4</xref>]. The main therapeutic aims of FD treatments are the amelioration of symptoms and the prevention of Gb3 deposition in the target organs to reduce disease progression and increase life expectancy. Indeed, ERT replaces the α-GalA deficiency and reduces Gb3 accumulation, while migalastat, the chaperone therapy available on the market, corrects the misfolded α-GalA. Both treatments have been proven to alleviate patients’ outcomes and survival [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR5"">5</xref>]. Regrettably, the approved therapies for FD have some limitations; for example, ERT has limited tissue penetration and cannot pass the blood–brain barrier. Moreover, it can induce adverse infusion reactions, and its efficacy could be limited due to the development of anti-drug-neutralizing antibodies. On the other hand, the chaperon therapy molecule binds only to specific α-GalA domain, so it is a therapeutic option only for patients with amenable GLA mutations, and it is not recommended in pregnancy and in subjects with a reduced glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) less than 30 ml/min/1.73m<sup>2</sup>[<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR5"">5</xref>]. The quest for more personalized and productive treatments has sparked research into novel therapeutic avenues, such as innovative ERT formulations, substrate reduction therapy, mRNA therapy, and gene therapy, heralding a new epoch of individualized medicine for FD [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR9"">9</xref>]. In this review, we analyze the epidemiology, pathophysiology, and therapies of FD, explicitly focusing on promising therapeutic possibilities that could move the treatment of this rare disease from a standardized to a personalized treatment. The authors conducted a comprehensive bibliographic search using Pubmed, Scopus, and Google Scholar databases. Specific keywords were used to explore Fabry Disease, its pathogenesis, symptoms, genetics, and treatment. The search was extended to synonyms and matching terms. Only original articles and reviews written in English and published in peer-reviewed journals were selected. The overall prevalence of the classic form of FD is estimated at around 1 in 40,000 to 170,000 births [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR6"">6</xref>]. However, the actual prevalence of this condition is likely higher due to the challenges in diagnosing a disease with a wide range of clinical presentations and ages at presentation, particularly the atypical or attenuated form. Newborn screening programs for FD have been developed to make an early diagnosis of the disease. However, as Gragnaniello et al. [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR7"">7</xref>] recently summarized in a literature review, newborn screening is controversial. Among the advantages of such screening is the opportunity to obtain an early diagnosis of a treatable disease, expand screening, counseling, and, eventually, therapy for other family members. Of course, there are some disadvantages, including the possibility of detecting Variants of Uncertain Significance (VUS) and benign variants, the early diagnosis of late-onset variants, which may have a negative psychological impact on patients and parents, and the lack of well-defined guidelines for follow-up and for the timing of therapy initiation. Among the disadvantages, it is essential to mention the difficulty in identifying heterozygous females through enzymatic assays. Between 2003 and 2005, in Northwest Italy’s Piemonte region, a pilot Newborn Screening (NBS) project for lysosomal storage diseases focused on Fabry disease (FD) was started. They screened 37,104 male newborns using a fluorometric assay. Among them, twelve neonates tested positive for a specific GLA variant (occurring in 1 out of 3,092 males). Interestingly, only one patient carried a variant linked to the classic phenotype, highlighting a notable prevalence of later-onset forms [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR8"">8</xref>]. Another Italian study recently analyzed dried blood spots (DBS) from 173.342 newborns and found an estimated incidence of FD ranging from 1:1.145 to 1:18.436 [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR9"">9</xref>]. An interesting epidemiological study was recently performed on 200,643 samples from the UK Biobank. Exome sequencing data were collected to determine the overall prevalence of GLA variants. The results showed that the prevalence of the FD-causing variant was 1 in 5,573, which aligns with the studies described above [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR10"">10</xref>]. There are challenges in establishing a definitive and unambiguous prevalence of FD. In the non-classic forms of FD, symptoms can be very mild, presenting only later in life, and highly unspecific (e.g., stroke, left ventricular hypertrophy, chronic renal disease…). Molecular analyses are not always of help since there are more than 1.000 different reported variants in the GLA gene, and, in many cases, genetic testing identifies very rare or private variants of unknown significance. Furthermore, testing for levels of enzymatic activity often lacks sensitivity, especially in females, and borderline results can be challenging to interpret. Establishing the diagnosis in women, who usually present a milder and unspecific phenotype, is particularly difficult. These difficulties can lead to missed diagnoses and an underestimation of FD's prevalence. Mutations in the GLA gene are responsible for the absence or reduced activity of the enzyme α-GalA, which consequently alters the metabolism of some glycosphingolipids and accumulates metabolites in many tissues, such as globotriaosylceramide (Gb3) and its deacylated hydrophilic derivatives, such as lysoGb3 (or globotriaosylsphingosine) and its analogs (Fig. <xref rid=""Fig1"" ref-type=""fig"">1</xref>) [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR4"">4</xref>].<fig id=""Fig1""><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>Pathophysiology of Fabry disease. Lysosomal accumulation of glycosphingolipids in different cell lines is responsible for organ damage in Fabry disease</p></caption><graphic http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink href=""11255_2024_4042_Fig1_HTML"" id=""MO1""></graphic></fig> The occurrence of clinically significant FD is associated with α-GalA activity falling below a threshold level of approximately 30–35% of the average expected value [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR11"">11</xref>]. Males with the classic form exhibit a residual enzyme activity of less than 1% of the normal value, whereas females and those with the attenuated forms show higher values. The likelihood of developing complications related to the disease is primarily determined by enzyme activity [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR12"">12</xref>, <xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR13"">13</xref>]. It is known that α-GalA deficiency causes the accumulation of Gb3 in lysosomes in various tissues, but the mechanism(s) by which this occurs remains unclear [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR12"">12</xref>]. Especially, Gb3 accumulation is increased in vascular endothelium, vascular smooth muscle cells, and pericytes, potentially leading to several health issues, such as cell death, vascular occlusion, ischemia, and infarction [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR11"">11</xref>]. Additionally, elevated levels of Gb3 are also found in the autonomic ganglia, dorsal root ganglia, renal glomerulus, renal tubule and interstitial cells, cardiac muscle cells, corneal endothelial cells, valvular fibrocytes, cardiac conduction cells, resulting in a range of disease symptoms. However, the disease is not solely attributed to the accumulation of Gb3, and other factors, though not fully understood, may play a role in the overall clinical picture. The accumulation of Gb3 not only leads to mechanical effects but also triggers inflammation. When α-GalA is deficient, the degradation of lipid antigens is limited, allowing for their accumulation with the activation of natural killer T cells that contribute to chronic inflammation and autoimmunity [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR14"">14</xref>]. Additionally, the accumulation of Gb3 can impair endocytosis and autophagy (crucial recycling pathways that promote cell survival), induce apoptosis, and disrupt mitochondrial energy production [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR15"">15</xref>]. Another characteristic of FD is the significant increase in water-soluble deacylated Gb3, also referred to as globotriaosylsphingosine (lyso-Gb3), and its analogs: they are believed to possess cytotoxic, proinflammatory, and profibrotic properties, further contributing to the development of the disease [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR16"">16</xref>]. In particular, lysoGb3, increased in both the blood and urine of affected patients, is responsible for smooth muscle cell proliferation, which leads to increased thickness and arterial stiffness. Additionally, it can induce pain in the extremities by damaging nociceptive neurons. At the same time, it may cause podocyte loss and glomerular fibrosis in the kidney and inhibit endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS), promoting vasculopathy [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR17"">17</xref>, <xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR18"">18</xref>]. Furthermore, the dosage of lyso-gb3 is helpful in clinical practice: it correlates with the severity of the disease, allows confirmation of the diagnosis in case of detection of a genetic variant of uncertain significance, and evaluates the response to therapy [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR13"">13</xref>]. Clinical features in FD are depicted in Fig. <xref rid=""Fig2"" ref-type=""fig"">2</xref>. The significant morbidity and mortality rate in FD can be attributed to the chronic and progressive damage to the kidneys, heart, and central nervous system. <fig id=""Fig2""><label>Fig. 2</label><caption><p>Clinical features of Fabry disease</p></caption><graphic http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink href=""11255_2024_4042_Fig2_HTML"" id=""MO2""></graphic></fig> Renal involvement has been identified through vacuolated epithelial cells and podocytes in both the glomerulus and distal tubules. The light microscope shows lipid inclusions visible as clusters of intracellular vacuoles. Intracytoplasmic irregular lamellar bodies containing Gb3, called “zebra bodies,” are visible through electron microscopy. Over time, the glomeruli become increasingly sclerotic, and mesangial widening, tubular atrophy, and interstitial fibrosis can be observed in kidney biopsies. Notably, proteinuria often precedes damage to the renal system as it can occur as early as adolescence, further promoting renal damage and end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) in the fourth decade of life. Oxidative stress, inflammation, and endothelial dysfunction are other kidney, brain, and cardiovascular damage factors. Increased circulating levels of ROS (reactive oxygen species), interleukin-1, and decreased availability of NO (nitric oxide) promote arterial intimal hyperplasia as well as deposition of abnormal extracellular matrix and hyaline material in the context of the arterial wall, resulting in vascular calcification, arterial stiffness, and elevated differential pressure [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR19"">19</xref>, <xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR20"">20</xref>]. Gb3 and lyso-Gb3 accumulation also contribute to the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) through the production of TGF-beta (transforming growth factor-beta). Hence, epithelial tubular cells in the kidneys modify their phenotype into myofibroblasts and synthesize extracellular matrix, contributing to fibrotic damage and organ failure [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR21"">21</xref>]. An elegant work by Tondel et al. [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR22"">22</xref>] showed that Gb3 and lyso-Gb3 accumulation and fibrotic damages occur in the kidneys before the occurrence of microalbuminuria or proteinuria. Indeed, in a series of 8 kidney biopsies of children (aged 4 to 16 years) with FD, authors found Gb3 accumulation in several cellular types with a particular podocyte involvement, which undergo a segmental effacement. In this series, participants exhibited normal renal function and no signs of albuminuria or proteinuria [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR22"">22</xref>]. This could have implications on the controversial issue about the timing of treatment starting in young male patients or females considered “asymptomatic.” Accumulation of Gb3 and lyso-Gb3 also occurs in the heart and affects all cardiac cell types and tissues such as the myocytes, the vascular endothelial cells, smooth muscle cells, the endocardium, fibroblasts of valvular apparatus, and the conduction system [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR14"">14</xref>]. The typical cardiomyopathy of FD is primarily characterized by left ventricular hypertrophy with restrictive cardiomyopathy features. In almost half of the affected patients, valvular abnormalities have been documented, although they are seldom classified as severe. Upon ultrastructural investigation, it was discovered that cardiomyocytes were larger and contained vacuoles filled with Gb3 in their perinuclear regions. Progressive accumulation of sphingolipids leads to interstitial fibrosis that becomes more prevalent and worsens in severity over time. Smooth muscle cell hypertrophy and proliferation induce intramyocardial arterioles thickening, leading to arterial stiffening. Finally, the accumulation of Gb3 causes biochemical and functional impairment of myocytes [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR14"">14</xref>, <xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR23"">23</xref>, <xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR24"">24</xref>]. The typical neurological involvement in FD occurs in the small fiber, leading to peripheral neuropathy characterized by pain, cold, and heat intolerance, and in the central nervous system leading to early cerebrovascular disease. Indeed, accumulation of glycosphingolipids and thickening of the vessel walls results in the narrowing of cerebral micro-vessels predisposing to transient ischemic attack (TIA) or stroke. Of course, many other cerebrovascular accidents and TIA events are related to cardiac arrhythmias, such as atrial fibrillation or other cardiac conduction abnormalities [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR25"">25</xref>]. The autonomic nervous system is also involved, and FD patients often report gastrointestinal symptoms and hyperhidrosis. Patients also experience burning pain, especially at the extremities, and pain crises that manifest early in life (2 or 3 years of age) [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR26"">26</xref>], and a lower skin innervation where G3b deposition occurs has been documented in skin biopsies of patients with classic and non-classic FD [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR27"">27</xref>, <xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR28"">28</xref>]. Although neuropathic disorders are amongst the most significant symptoms of neurological involvement in FD, symptoms of autonomic dysfunction are also present, even if they may not be as noticeable as in other neuropathic disorders. Recent research [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR29"">29</xref>] has shown that autonomic neuropathy in FD presents with a spectrum of symptoms, including gastrointestinal issues, orthostatic intolerance, and sexual dysfunction. However, these manifestations are less common and more severe than expected [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR30"">30</xref>–<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR32"">32</xref>]. Data obtained from 342 Fabry patients enrolled in the Fabry Outcome Survey (FOS) revealed that 60.8% of children and 49.8% of adults experienced gastrointestinal complaints. The most frequently reported gastrointestinal symptoms were abdominal pain and diarrhea [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR33"">33</xref>]. These complaints have frequently been explained by autonomic failure: as multiple studies have shown, minor fiber damage[<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR34"">34</xref>] and accumulation of lipids in the autonomic ganglia in Fabry patients create symptoms and signs compatible with autonomic dysfunction [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR35"">35</xref>]. Ocular manifestations are also due to glycosphingolipid accumulation in eye tissues and can be observed early in life. The main ocular signs in FD include cornea verticillate (specifically corneal epithelial opacities), conjunctival or retinal vessel alterations, and posterior cataracts [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR36"">36</xref>]. Interestingly, cornea verticillate appears to be associated with a more severe disease course and with null or missense mutation rather than mild or the p.N512S mutations [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR37"">37</xref>]. Dermatological signs are persistent in FD. It is estimated that over 70% of the patients show skin manifestations. The most typical signs are angiokeratomas in the pelvic region, inside the navel, and in males in the scrotum [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR38"">38</xref>]. Fabry Disease (FD) presents a complex clinical picture with diverse manifestations affecting multiple organ systems. The prognosis is intricately linked to the extent of organ involvement and the timeliness of diagnosis. Renal and cardiac complications notably influence life expectancy, while neurological and dermatological symptoms predominantly impact the quality of life. The array of clinical signs, coupled with non-specific symptoms and FD's rarity, frequently leads to delayed diagnosis, which can extend up to 11 years from symptom onset to definitive diagnosis, hindering timely therapeutic intervention and exacerbating organ damage [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR33"">33</xref>]. Before enzyme replacement therapy (ERT), life expectancy was about 25 and 10 years shorter in males and females with FD than peers in the unaffected population. Many FD patients died before the age of 50 years, and no one lived more than 60 years. Before the introduction of renal replacement therapies (both dialysis and kidney transplantation), patients died primarily because of uremia, heart failure, arrhythmia, and syncope [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR39"">39</xref>–<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR41"">41</xref>]. About 40% of deaths are caused by cardiovascular events, while < 10% are caused by renal and cerebrovascular events [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR42"">42</xref>]. Three different phases characterize renal involvement in untreated FD male patients. The first occurs during childhood and adolescence and is characterized by glomerular hyperfiltration, usually without any alteration at urinalysis. In a subsequent phase, proteinuria, lipiduria, crystals, and Malta crosses appear in urine sediment, and the urinary concentrating or diluting capacity is altered. The last phase is characterized by severe vascular and renal involvement with progressive renal function decline and end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) development that, in males affected by the classic FD form, commonly manifests between the third and fifth decades of life [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR43"">43</xref>]. Studies have shown that the early start of nephroprotective treatments and specific therapies after the initial kidney involvement prevents or reduces renal function decline. Since proteinuria is one of the most critical factors in the progression of kidney damage, its reduction helps preserve kidney function. Warnock et al. published a study demonstrating how treatment with ACE inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs), In addition to ERT, increases the rate of proteinuria reduction. Moreover, patients who achieved the UPCR goal of < 0.5 mg/g had a significant eGFR slope reduction, specifically − 3.6 (− 4.8 to − 1.1) versus − 7.0 (− 9.0 to − 5.6) ml/min/1.73 m<sup>2</sup>/year, respectively (<italic toggle=""yes"">p</italic> = 0.018) [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR44"">44</xref>]. Cerebrovascular manifestations are quite frequent events in FD, with an incidence of 11–25% of male patients compared to 15–21% of female patients. Typically, these events occur earlier in males (around 39.2 years old) than in females (around 51.4 years old). Similar to cardiac and renal involvement, transient ischemic attack and cerebral strokes play a significant role in the morbidity and mortality of FD [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR38"">38</xref>]. In terms of survival, as reported by Waldeck et al. in a study published in 2009, which analyzed data from the Fabry Registry, males affected by FD die at a median age of 54.3 years (range 31.2–84.8), while females die at 62 years (range 39.9–76.1). The data for this analysis covers the period between 2001 (the year of approval of ERT) and 2008. Notably, deceased patients received the diagnosis of FD at an older age than living patients. Specifically, deceased males had a median age of 39.8 years, whereas living males were diagnosed at 24.4 years, and women at 55.4 years compared with 32.7 years. Furthermore, among deceased patients, not everyone had received ERT; only 81.3% of males and 41.7% of females had, with a median treatment length of 12 months and four months, respectively [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR42"">42</xref>]. A more recent evaluation of the Fabry Outcome Survey data showed an essential difference between the median survival of male patients treated with ERT for five years (77.5 years) and untreated subjects(60 years) [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR38"">38</xref>]. A clear genotype–phenotype correlation in FD was not established because of the elevated number of private pathogenic variants among the affected family members. At the same time, because of the heterogeneous expression of mutated genes that lead to phenotypic differences among patients, some mutations are known to be associated with both classic and attenuated disease [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR45"">45</xref>]. Variants associated with the classical phenotype can include splicing defects, missense, and nonsense variants. Similarly, variants with similar characteristics can be found in patients with attenuated disease [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR45"">45</xref>]. Additionally, some frequent alterations are associated with specific phenotypes and older age of symptom onset: for example the IVS4 919G > A mutation is mainly associated with concentric left ventricular inclusion hypertrophy (LVH), valvular involvement, and arrhythmias between ages 50 and 80, with limited extracardiac involvement, the N215S mutation correlates with an onset of symptoms after the age of 50, lower decrease in enzyme activity, and only myocardium impairment [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR46"">46</xref>, <xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR47"">47</xref>]. However, with rare exceptions, predicting the phenotype and prognosis based solely on the diagnosed genetic variant is challenging. Therefore, patients should undergo evaluation and follow-up by a multidisciplinary team of expert physicians. Since 2000–2001, the natural history of FD has changed, and the prognosis has improved thanks to the introduction of targeted therapies that aim to restore impaired α-GalA enzyme activity. Currently, two classes of therapies are available for clinical use: enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) and chaperone therapy. ERT is based on the intravenous administration of exogenous alpha-galactosidase A to replace the enzyme deficiency. The first two commercially available formulations of recombinant human α-GalA enzyme are Replagal (agalsidase alpha, iv 0.2 mg/kg/every other week) and Fabrazyme (agalsidase beta, iv 1 mg/kg/every other week). Both compounds have been approved for clinical use in different countries since the early 2000s [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR48"">48</xref>]. An extended clinical experience and much evidence support their safety and efficacy [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR5"">5</xref>]. Both preparations have been demonstrated to decrease plasma Gb3 and lyso-Gb3 levels, urinary Gb3 levels, Gb3 deposition in the kidney, stabilize/decrease the reduction of eGFR, stabilize/decrease left ventricular mass, to improve nerve sensitivity, gastrointestinal symptoms, pain and quality of life [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR5"">5</xref>]. Both are safe and effective in improving symptoms and disease progression; no difference was found in their clinical efficacy [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR49"">49</xref>]. Although they share almost the same amino acid composition, the two preparations differ in production technology, as agalsidase alpha is produced from genetically engineered human cell lines (fibroblast, human fibrosarcoma cells HT-1080). In contrast, agalsidase beta is produced in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR50"">50</xref>]. The current recommendations highlight the importance of an early initiation of ERT treatment, but there are some minor differences between the American and European guidelines. While the European Fabry Disease Network (EFDN) suggests that for classically affected males, ERT is recommended as soon as there are early clinical signs of kidney, heart, or brain involvement and may be considered in patients of ≥ 16 years even in the absence of clinical signs or symptoms of organ involvement [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR51"">51</xref>], the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics (ACMG) guidelines recommend that ERT be initiated as early as possible in all males with Fabry disease (including children and those with ESKD undergoing dialysis and kidney transplantation), as all are at high risk for renal, cardiac, and cerebrovascular complications [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR52"">52</xref>]. In males with classic FD, ERT should be initiated in both symptomatic and asymptomatic individuals, it is appropriate at any age of presentation and should be considered also before adulthood (< 18 years old) [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR4"">4</xref>]. Indeed, it has been shown that men with classical FD who started ERT before age 25 had a more significant reduction of plasma lyso-Gb3 and a lower risk of developing antibodies [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR53"">53</xref>]. In late-onset males and classic/late-onset females, ERT should also be considered in asymptomatic individuals with evidence of central organ involvement (this includes GFR < 90 mL/min/1.73 m<sup>2</sup>, persistent albuminuria > 30 mg/g, podocyte foot process effacement or glomerulosclerosis on renal biopsy, moderate or severe Gb3 inclusions in renal cell types; silent strokes, cerebral white matter lesions on brain MRI; asymptomatic cardiac disease such as cardiomyopathy or arrhythmia, cardiac fibrosis on contrast cardiac MRI) [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR4"">4</xref>, <xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR51"">51</xref>]. Despite their efficacy, ERTs present several limitations. ERT may not fully reverse FD physiopathology and clinical manifestations of FD. ERT has limited bioavailability due to poor permeability through the blood–brain barrier. Additionally, adverse reactions to infusions have been reported, and ERT requires long-term intravenous administration, potentially leading to antibody responses. Studies showed that anti-drug antibodies (ADAs) usually develop in three to six months after the ERT start, are most frequent in males affected by classic FD, and a cross-reaction was demonstrated with agalsidase alfa and beta [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR54"">54</xref>–<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR56"">56</xref>]. Inhibitory anti-drug antibodies are mainly IgG1 and IgG4 [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR57"">57</xref>]. They may affect ERT efficacy by binding to the enzyme, leading to macrophage activation, antibody-ERT complexes internalization, and enzyme inactivation [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR55"">55</xref>]. The reduced target cellular uptake of the enzyme reduces the effectiveness of ERT and is associated with worse renal and cardiac outcomes and worsening of the patient’s symptoms [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR58"">58</xref>]. Hence, it is of primary importance to know the serostatus of patients through the identification of ADAs, as demonstrated by Lenders et al. [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR58"">58</xref>] by serum-mediated inhibition assays followed by titration assays to determine the individual inhibitory capacities of ADAs. To mitigate the adverse effects of anti-drug antibodies, a potential strategy involves increasing the dose of ERT. A recent study demonstrated that dose escalation has varied long-term effects on patients. It appears to cause an increase in ADA titers after the switch, but it could also result in sustained ADA saturation. Regardless of an increase in ADA titers, lyso-Gb3 levels decrease, and cardiac and renal parameters remain stable over time in patients who experienced a fivefold dosage increase of ERT [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR59"">59</xref>]. A different approach was evaluated to prevent ADA formation by administering immunosuppressive therapy, as shown in an analysis of Fabry patients who received immunosuppressive drugs for kidney or heart transplantation. This demonstrated its efficacy in preventing de novo ERT inhibition in ERT naive patients [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR60"">60</xref>]. However, while higher doses of immunosuppressive medications are linked with reduced antibody levels and less ERT inhibition in affected patients, they do not provide lasting protection, and these drugs' side effects must be considered. In 2016, Galafold (migalastat, <italic toggle=""yes"">per os</italic> 123 mg/every other day), the first-in-class pharmacological chaperone therapy for FD, was approved in Europe. It is an iminosugar analog of the terminal galactose residue of Gb3 and acts as a competitive inhibitor of the α-GalA enzyme. Migalastat selectively and reversibly binds to the active site of alpha-galactosidase A. This binding stabilizes the α-GalA enzyme, facilitating its proper trafficking from the endoplasmic reticulum into the lysosome. Once in the lysosome, the lower pH and the higher concentration of substrates lead to the dissociation of migalastat from the endogenous enzyme, allowing it to exert its action (Gb3 and related substrates catabolism). Its efficacy has been demonstrated in the FACETS trial, where migalastat was compared to placebo, and in the ATTRACT trial, where it was compared to ERT. In both studies, treatment with migalastat effectively reduced the left ventricular mass index and stabilized the eGFR [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR61"">61</xref>, <xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR62"">62</xref>]. Because of its characteristics, migalastat shows different advantages compared to ERT. It is administered orally, has a better tissue distribution (small molecule), induces sustained and stable enzyme levels, and does not exhibit immunogenicity [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR5"">5</xref>]. On the other hand, chaperone therapy is a therapeutic option only for patients with ‘amenable’ variants that result in abnormally folded or less stable proteins with retained enzymatic activity (a list of GLA amenable variants is reported in the Galafold product information document released by EMA and FDA and is accessible online at <ext-link ext-link-type=""uri"" http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink href=""https://www.galafoldamenabilitytable.com"">https://www.galafoldamenabilitytable.com</ext-link>). The amenability of GLA variants is evaluated through an in vitro assay, in which Human Embryonic Kidney (HEK-293) cell lines are transfected with specific variants and produce mutant proteins. A variant is amenable when the enzyme activity shows an increase of at least 20% compared to the pre-treatment and an absolute increase of at least 3% of the wild-type α-GalA activity. Thus, chaperone therapy cannot be used for treatment in patients with a mutation causing a severe enzyme activity depletion (i.e., gene deletion leading to no endogenous α-GalA enzyme activity). Of note, in vitro amenability does not reflect the effectiveness of the chaperone treatment, as the in vitro assay may not evaluate mutant proteins trafficking into the lysosome or the dissociation of migalastat from the mutant proteins within the lysosome [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR5"">5</xref>, <xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR63"">63</xref>]. Watching the behavior of individuals with Fabry Disease is essential for efficiently managing their clinical care. Despite putative biomarkers associated with biological activity in Fabry disease have been researched, the ideal biomarker for clinical application has yet to be identified. As a result, other instruments already validated to assess and follow disease progression are necessary. The initial two scoring systems designed to measure the severity of Fabry disease were the Mainz Severity Score Index (MSSI) and the Fabry Disease Severity Scoring System (DS3) [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR2"">2</xref>, <xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR64"">64</xref>]. Both of these systems necessitate the evaluation of multiple domains, with a considerable number of items to consider (DS3 includes five domains and 12 items, while MSSI consists of 4 domains and 24 items). As a result, calculating and implementing these indices can be time-consuming and potentially challenging. Additionally, certain items within these indices heavily rely on symptom ratings reported by the patients themselves. Lastly, these tools only provide a snapshot of disease severity at a specific moment, failing to estimate the clinical variation compared to previous visits. In 2016, a group of Italian experts developed a dynamic mathematical model [the FASTEX (Fabry Stabilization indEX)] to assess clinical stability. First is a simplified scoring system called the Raw Score (RW). This score evaluated seven parameters that are easy to access: neuropathic pain, cerebrovascular events, albuminuria and proteinuria, estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), echocardiographic and electrocardiographic alterations, as well as the New York Heart Association (NYHA) classification. Each of these parameters is graded from 0 to 4 based on the severity of the clinical manifestation. Subsequently, the Weighted Score (WS) has been introduced to represent the true impact of each clinical manifestation as a percentage. After extensive research, a mathematical algorithm was created to calculate the extent of deterioration in patients' conditions. This algorithm involves entering the RS score from a previous visit and the RS score from the second most recent visit to obtain a percentage value known as the FASTEX score. It was unanimously agreed that a FASTEX score of 20% would serve as a threshold for disease stability [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR1"">1</xref>]. Research into new treatments for FD has intensified due to the limitations of currently available therapies. Investigations are underway for novel approaches like new enzyme replacement therapy (ERT), substrate reduction therapy (SRT), mRNA therapy, and genetic therapy [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR5"">5</xref>]. Two intriguing molecules have been studied to extend ERT possibilities. Pegunigalsidase alfa is a modified alfa galactosidase A produced from a plant-based cells system with a PEGylation, which determines a higher stability and half-life and a different biodistribution profile from agalsidase alfa and beta, which could allow monthly infusion as is under investigation in an open-label study to assess efficacy and safety of this distinct dose regimen (NCT03614234). Pegunigalsidase alfa was approved by the FDA in 2023 since it has been proven to be effective in reducing plasma lyso-Gb3 levels and its deposition in the kidney, slowing eGFR slope and proteinuria levels, as well as deposition in the left ventricle. Additionally, PEGylation appears to mask some epitopes from the immune system, reducing immunogenicity. Studies have even shown that pegunigalsidase can reverse anti-drug antibodies and induce immune tolerance [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR65"">65</xref>–<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR67"">67</xref>], and it has been proven to be non-inferior to the two previously approved ERTs [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR68"">68</xref>, <xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR69"">69</xref>]. A second ERT molecule under development is the moss-derived alfa-galactosidase A. This enzyme is derived from <italic toggle=""yes"">Phycomitrella patens</italic>. It has been designed to elude the immunogenic response. Although it has a shorter half-life due to increased cellular uptake via the mannose receptor, it has been demonstrated that it induces a reduction of urinary Gb3 [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR70"">70</xref>, <xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR71"">71</xref>]. Another approach to reducing globotriaosylceramide deposits interferes with its synthesis by blocking the glucosylceramide synthetase (GCS), the enzyme responsible for the initial biosynthesis step (Substrate Reduction Therapy—SRT). Two drugs currently under investigation for this purpose are ibiglustat (Venglustat) and lucerastat. These drugs aim to reduce Gb3 to a level that can be catabolized by the residual activity of α-GalA (non-classical mutations). Alternatively, SRT can be added to ERT if α-GalA activity is lower than 1%. The oral administration and the penetration to the blood–brain barrier are the main advantages of SRT [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR5"">5</xref>, <xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR72"">72</xref>] however, these compounds are still not available for routine prescription, and clinical trials are ongoing to evaluate their efficacy and safety (NCT0528054, NCT05206773, NCT03737214) Recently, a new glucosylceramide synthetase inhibitor (AL01211) has been assessed in a phase-1 trial in which safety, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics effects were studied. It is currently under investigation in naive male subjects affected by the classic disease (NCT06114329). RNA therapy involves mRNA molecules encapsulated in lipid nanoparticles, which deliver GLA to hepatocytes. This allows hepatocytes to produce the correct protein and secrete it into circulation. Studies in mice and non-human primates demonstrated an increase in enzyme activity in a dose-dependent manner, along with reductions in Gb3 and lyso-Gb3 levels [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR73"">73</xref>, <xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR74"">74</xref>]. A functional GLA gene is introduced into cells using either viral or non-viral vectors in gene therapy. Generally, these therapies rely on targeted cells overexpressing the interested gene, while other cell lines take up GLA via mannose-6-phosphate receptors, transporting it to the lysosomes. However, the lack of specific vectors for the heart and kidney poses challenges for gene therapy. Currently, the gene is primarily transported to hepatic cells or HSPCs (hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells), where it is transcribed and translated into enzymes, released in circulation, and taken up by other cell tissues [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR75"">75</xref>–<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR77"">77</xref>]. In addition to specific therapies, cardio- and nephro-protection are fundamental to slow disease progression, especially when organ damage is already established. With this aim, renin–angiotensin–aldosterone system inhibitors (RAASi) have been used as an add-on ERT therapy with a further positive effect on renal function protection [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR78"">78</xref>]. Over the last years, the inhibitors of sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 (SGLT2i) have been massively studied for their antiproteinuric, natriuretic nephro- and cardio-protective effects [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR79"">79</xref>]. At the moment, there is one clinical trial that aims to evaluate the effect of SGLT2i (Dapagliflozin) on albuminuria, kidney disease progression and cardiologic involvement and exercise capacity and quality of life in patients with FD and CKD stages 1 to 3 [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR80"">80</xref>]. Braun et al. published a study in which alfa-synuclein's possible role in podocyte injury was established. Using a proteomic and transcriptomic approach, the authors have identified an upregulation of alfa-synuclein in GLA-deficient podocytes [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR81"">81</xref>]. This could be an additional pathogenic mechanism explaining why even though ERT significantly reduces the volume of Gb3 inclusions in the kidney, podocyte injury does not improve. Moreover, this could be a possible future therapeutic target, even if more studies are needed. Currently under research but hopefully usable soon is the possibility to study transcriptional data of nephron compartments (glomeruli, tubules, interstitium, arteries) from renal biopsies. This can help to identify a priori the response to enzyme replacement therapy or the possible expression of ERT-resistance genes. Studying transcriptional products can also help evaluate when ERT should be started because, as known, mRNA expression precedes clinical alterations [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR62"">62</xref>]. Undoubtedly, Fabry Disease (FD) is now on the cusp of a transformative era characterized by personalized medicine. Soon, diagnosis, therapies, and follow-up will be customized based on individual and specific factors such as gene mutation types and gene expressions and the severity of organ involvement. While effective to some degree, the one-size-fits-all approach will likely give way to a combination of drugs tailored to the residual α-GalA residual activity or guided by the presence and titer of ERT antibodies. Additionally, management will also be guided by the specific gene mutation types. Current and emerging supportive therapies will undoubtedly enrich this individualized treatment paradigm. By synergizing specific, person-centered therapies with cardio-renal protective strategies, we will likely witness a significant enhancement in the survival rates and overall quality of life for those afflicted by FD. This shift from a standard to a precision-based treatment model reflects the field's progress and underscores a future where medical interventions can be as unique as the individuals they aim to heal.",N/A,13 4 2024
Exploring the diagnostic potential of miRNA signatures in the Fabry disease serum: A comparative study of automated and manual sample isolations,"Fabry disease, an X-linked lysosomal storage disorder caused by galactosidase α (GLA) gene mutations, exhibits diverse clinical manifestations, and poses significant diagnostic challenges. Early diagnosis and treatment are crucial for improved patient outcomes, pressing the need for reliable biomarkers. In this study, we aimed to identify miRNA candidates as potential biomarkers for Fabry disease using the KingFisher™ automated isolation method and NanoString nCounter® miRNA detection assay. Clinical serum samples were collected from both healthy subjects and Fabry disease patients. RNA extraction from the samples was performed using the KingFisher™ automated isolation method with the MagMAX mirVana<sup>TM</sup> kit or manually using the Qiagen miRNeasy kit. The subsequent NanoString nCounter® miRNA detection assay showed consistent performance and no correlation between RNA input concentration and raw count, ensuring reliable and reproducible results. Interestingly, the detection range and highly differential miRNA between the control and disease groups were found to be distinct depending on the isolation method employed. Nevertheless, enrichment analysis of miRNA-targeting genes consistently revealed significant associations with angiogenesis pathways in both isolation methods. Additionally, our investigation into the impact of enzyme replacement therapy on miRNA expression indicated that some differential miRNAs may be sensitive to treatment. Our study provides valuable insights to identify miRNA biomarkers for Fabry disease. While different isolation methods yielded various detection ranges and highly differential miRNAs, the consistent association with angiogenesis pathways suggests their significance in disease progression. These findings lay the groundwork for further investigations and validation studies, ultimately leading to the development of non-invasive and reliable biomarkers to aid in early diagnosis and treatment monitoring for Fabry disease.","Fabry disease (FD, OMIM 301500) is a rare X-lined lysosomal storage disorder caused by the deficiency or malfunction of the enzyme α-galactosidase A(α-gal-A, EC3,2.1.22), resulting in the accumulation of globotriaosylceramide (Gb3) and related glycosphingolipids within lysosomes in various cells, including capillary endothelial, renal (podocytes, tubular cells, glomerular endothelial, mesangial and interstitial cells), cardiac (cardiomyocytes and fibroblasts) and nerve cells [<xref rid=""pone.0301733.ref001"" ref-type=""bibr"">1</xref>]. This progressive lysosomal storage disorder predominantly affects males and can lead to severe complications in the heart, kidneys, skin, eyes, central nervous system, and gastrointestinal system [<xref rid=""pone.0301733.ref002"" ref-type=""bibr"">2</xref>]. Due to the lyonization process inactivating one X-chromosome, some female patients have milder disease progression or delayed disease onset [<xref rid=""pone.0301733.ref003"" ref-type=""bibr"">3</xref>]. Despite advancements in FD research, the identification of reliable and specific biomarkers that reflect the disease progression and the response to treatment remains a challenge. Traditional methods, such as enzyme assays and genetic testing, have limitations in terms of sensitivity, specificity, and the ability to reflect clinical outcomes. Thus, there is a critical need for further research to identify and validate more useful biomarkers for FD. Circulating miRNAs in liquid biopsies, such as serum samples, offer a minimally invasive, easily accessible source and are stable in long-term storage at room temperature, variable pH, and multiple freeze-thaw cycles, common conditions necessary for biomarker applications [<xref rid=""pone.0301733.ref004"" ref-type=""bibr"">4</xref>–<xref rid=""pone.0301733.ref007"" ref-type=""bibr"">7</xref>], making them an optimal option for identifying disease-specific molecular signatures for FD diagnostics. Current FD associated miRNAs have been reported about their key roles in cardiac function [<xref rid=""pone.0301733.ref008"" ref-type=""bibr"">8</xref>–<xref rid=""pone.0301733.ref010"" ref-type=""bibr"">10</xref>] and kidney disease progression [<xref rid=""pone.0301733.ref011"" ref-type=""bibr"">11</xref>–<xref rid=""pone.0301733.ref013"" ref-type=""bibr"">13</xref>]. However, the complex pathophysiology of FD and the low abundance of circulating miRNAs present additional hurdles for biomarker discovery. The NanoString nCounter® assay addresses these challenges by offering an image-based multiplex detection of miRNA sequences. Its digital counting capability ensures an accurate quantification, while the direct measurement of miRNAs without PCR amplification enhances sensitivity, minimizes variability, and avoids potential biases towards abundant miRNA from RNA amplification [<xref rid=""pone.0301733.ref014"" ref-type=""bibr"">14</xref>, <xref rid=""pone.0301733.ref015"" ref-type=""bibr"">15</xref>]. Furthermore, this platform has received FDA 510(k) clearance and is currently in use for testing the PAM50 gene signature to assess the risk of recurrence in breast cancer and patient stratification in postmenopausal women [<xref rid=""pone.0301733.ref016"" ref-type=""bibr"">16</xref>, <xref rid=""pone.0301733.ref017"" ref-type=""bibr"">17</xref>]. Therefore, a Nanostring-based miRNA assay platform may provide clinical utility. Recently, Cammarata et al. have demonstrated the feasibility of using Nanostring assay with manual (Qiagen miRNeasy Serum/Plasma kit) miRNA isolation to identify common plasma miRNA profiles in FD patients [<xref rid=""pone.0301733.ref018"" ref-type=""bibr"">18</xref>]. However, the reported assay process is labor intensive and subject to variations from operators in conducting miRNA isolations. As shown in this work, we successfully interfaced the Nanostring assay with an automated process for isolation of the total small RNA by leveraging the capabilities of a KingFisher™ automation system (MagMAX<sup>TM</sup> total RNA isolation kit). The combination of the KingFisher<sup>TM</sup> automation system and NanoString nCounter® assay could accelerate the workflow to assess miRNA expression profile in serum samples. Using the improved assay workflow, we identified distinct miRNA signatures associated with the occurrence of disease and the response to enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) with a detailed comparison of miRNA profile between manual and automation isolations. This established automated assay and procedure are generic and could be readily applicable for creating reliable assays to monitor the complex excretion profile of miRNA in any liquid biopsies for FD diagnosis, prognosis, and evaluation of treatment outcomes.   In this study, we investigated the impact of different isolation methods on miRNA expression profiles in Fabry patients using the NanoString nCounter® platform. We found that the isolation method did not significantly affect the assay performance and sum of NanoString raw counts. However, it did have an impact on the type of miRNAs detected and the list of highly differential miRNAs in the comparison between Fabry patients and healthy controls. Despite these differences, both methods consistently demonstrated that serum from Fabry patients presented greater miRNA diversity and more clustered miRNA expression profiles according to gender, age, and ERT status compared to the healthy control group, even with the divergence in the list of highly differential miRNA. These highly differential miRNAs are likely involved in a variety of pathways related to vascular formation, autophagy machinery, muscle homeostasis, and differentiation pathways [<xref rid=""pone.0301733.ref008"" ref-type=""bibr"">8</xref>, <xref rid=""pone.0301733.ref009"" ref-type=""bibr"">9</xref>, <xref rid=""pone.0301733.ref037"" ref-type=""bibr"">37</xref>–<xref rid=""pone.0301733.ref041"" ref-type=""bibr"">41</xref>]. The enrichment analysis provided quantitative evidence that the hub of genes derived from the highly differential miRNAs, regardless of the isolation method used, regulates different aspects of angiogenesis signals. Notably, previous research has linked the malfunction of TGF-β, PI3K, and Notch to Fabry disease nephropathy [<xref rid=""pone.0301733.ref001"" ref-type=""bibr"">1</xref>, <xref rid=""pone.0301733.ref042"" ref-type=""bibr"">42</xref>, <xref rid=""pone.0301733.ref043"" ref-type=""bibr"">43</xref>]. Moreover, we found that the majority of these differential miRNA expression levels could be altered by the ERT status. Therefore, these highly differential miRNAs could serve as a potential biomarker panel to track disease progression and treatment response if the results are obtained from the same isolation method. A similar Fabry biomarker discovery study conducted by Giuseppe Cammarata et al. employed the same Qiagen miRNA isolation kit and NanoString nCounter® platform (v2 instead of v3 in our study) [<xref rid=""pone.0301733.ref018"" ref-type=""bibr"">18</xref>]. They identified 18 highly differential miRNAs (p-value<0.05, |log2 fold of change|≥1.5) when compared to healthy controls. In the comparison of our results (the manual method part), two miRNAs, miR-126-3p and miR-146a-5p, were commonly identified in both studies, but the value of log2 fold of change was smaller, and regulating directions (up and down) were opposite, in our results. Additionally, both studies identified miR-199 and miR-361, let-7, but the subtype (-3p or -5p and a or b) and the regulating directions were different. These inconsistencies might result from the demographics of the sample age and gender. Fabry’s disease is an X-linked genetic disorder, and female patients often reveal milder symptoms than male patients. Consequently, the clinical manifestation of disease limits the availability of samples. In our study, all non-ERT-treated patient serum samples were obtained from female patients above the age of 53. Age is known to contribute to the heterogeneity of the serum miRNA profile in Fabry patients, and it also impacts miRNA expressions in healthy individuals. For instance, we observed a strong correlation between miR-181a-5p and miR-499b-5p with age (R<sup>2</sup> = 0.4988, p = 0.0224 and R<sup>2</sup> = 0.588, p = 0.0097, <xref rid=""pone.0301733.s002"" ref-type=""supplementary-material"">S2 Fig</xref>). Thus, the differential miRNAs identified may vary depending on the sample resource, but ultimately, these miRNAs are likely to target pathways associated with vascular differentiation or formation. Differential miRNAs in FD contribute to disease progression through disrupted autophagy, stress-induced apoptosis, abnormal vascularization, and inflammation, all leading to ongoing organ damage. In this study, we identified five miRNAs that affect autophagy: miR-181a-2-3p (targeting Parkin), miR-30d-5p (suppressing Beclin 1), miR-223, miR-130a-3p (both regulating ATG16L1), and let-7a (targeting Rictor, a component of mTOR complex 2) [<xref rid=""pone.0301733.ref034"" ref-type=""bibr"">34</xref>, <xref rid=""pone.0301733.ref044"" ref-type=""bibr"">44</xref>–<xref rid=""pone.0301733.ref046"" ref-type=""bibr"">46</xref>]. As lysosomal substrate buildup damages cells, apoptotic signals are triggered. For instance, miR-30d-5p targets FOXO3a to inhibit ARC (apoptosis repressor with caspase recruitment domain) [<xref rid=""pone.0301733.ref030"" ref-type=""bibr"">30</xref>]. Conversely, miR-374a-5p, a negative regulator of MAPK6-induced apoptosis, decreases as the disease progresses [<xref rid=""pone.0301733.ref035"" ref-type=""bibr"">35</xref>]. Circulating levels of miR-184 reflect tissue-specific damage, particularly in cardiac or renal cells [<xref rid=""pone.0301733.ref047"" ref-type=""bibr"">47</xref>, <xref rid=""pone.0301733.ref048"" ref-type=""bibr"">48</xref>]. Furthermore, cell stress in FD contributes to abnormal vascular formation. miR-361, miR-146, and miR-126 targeting-VEGF, Nox4, p85β, respectively-may disrupt vascular development and integrity, leading to organ damages [<xref rid=""pone.0301733.ref049"" ref-type=""bibr"">49</xref>–<xref rid=""pone.0301733.ref051"" ref-type=""bibr"">51</xref>]. Some miRNAs, such as miR-126, miR-146, and Let-7a, also play roles in inflammation, further aggravating disease progression and ongoing organ damage [<xref rid=""pone.0301733.ref052"" ref-type=""bibr"">52</xref>–<xref rid=""pone.0301733.ref054"" ref-type=""bibr"">54</xref>]. Thus, miRNA biomarkers in FD represent a dynamic group that evolves with disease progression, offering potential for improved monitoring and therapeutic targeting. In addition to the biomarker discovery, we also demonstrated possible parameters that could impact assay performance in the NanoString nCounter® assay when implementing an automated RNA isolation method. The variation in miRNA profiles was mainly due to the divergence of the isolation method rather than the RNA input concentration (<xref rid=""pone.0301733.g002"" ref-type=""fig"">Fig 2</xref>). Similar results were observed in several studies on miRNAs in serum. For instance, Marjorie Monleau et al. compared miRNA profiles using different RNA isolation kits and found that the extraction procedure impacted the detection range and G/C composition of miRNAs [<xref rid=""pone.0301733.ref055"" ref-type=""bibr"">55</xref>]. Similarly, Ryan Wong et al. evaluated the detection range of miRNAs from two different RNA isolation kits (MagnaZol RNA and Qiagen kits) for RNA-sequencing and found differences in the reads mapping to miRNAs and the diversity of detected miRNAs [<xref rid=""pone.0301733.ref056"" ref-type=""bibr"">56</xref>]. Moreover, the choice of RNA fraction used in the miRNA microarray and bead array-based assays can also impact miRNA profiles [<xref rid=""pone.0301733.ref057"" ref-type=""bibr"">57</xref>, <xref rid=""pone.0301733.ref058"" ref-type=""bibr"">58</xref>]. While there may be discrepancies in the miRNA detection range and the list of highly differential miRNA between automated and manual isolation methods, it is encouraging to note that a subset of miRNAs was consistently identified from both methods. This overlap adds robustness to the finding and strengthens the validity of the identified miRNAs as potential biomarkers for FD. Furthermore, the highly differential miRNA lists obtained through both methods demonstrated enrichment in angiogenesis-related pathways, which aligns with the biological context of the disease manifestation. The enrichment analysis provides important insights into the potential functional roles of these miRNAs in the pathogenesis of FD, particularly in relation to vascular formation and angiogenesis. The current study has some limitations that need to be addressed. First, the small sample size and imbalanced gender and age distribution could introduce bias. However, FD’s rarity and X chromosome-dependent nature pose significant challenges in recruiting sufficient sample sizes with equally distributed genders and ages. Therefore, selecting healthy control samples is crucial to match the disease group and reduce the impact of age on miRNA expression profiles during comparisons. Second, no single RNA kit can perfectly preserve all types of miRNAs for the experiment, resulting in a bias of miRNA detection range and the variation of target genes and pathways. Experiments performed in different cartridges and dates add another layer of variation within the data. Data comparisons should be performed optimally within the same experiment process to minimize the isolation method and batch bias. Although different isolation methods may yield different lists of highly differential miRNAs, the sample hierarchical clustering and functional analysis can still identify disease-associated pathways. Finally, there is no one-fit-for-all target prediction platform. Currently, most computational algorithms use classic seed pairing principles, which target-to-seed sequences within mRNA’s 3’ untranslated regions (UTRs). However, miRNA can bind to regions beyond the 3’ UTRs, and seed base-paring does not necessarily need to be perfect, as it can be complemented by additional 3’ compensatory base-paring [<xref rid=""pone.0301733.ref023"" ref-type=""bibr"">23</xref>, <xref rid=""pone.0301733.ref059"" ref-type=""bibr"">59</xref>–<xref rid=""pone.0301733.ref063"" ref-type=""bibr"">63</xref>]. To overcome the risk of over-prediction, we cross-validated computationally predicted miRNA-target interactions with miRTarBase, a database of experimentally validated interactions [<xref rid=""pone.0301733.ref064"" ref-type=""bibr"">64</xref>]. This study highlights the potential of automating the miRNA isolation process with the NanoString nCounter® assay for FD biomarker discovery. The implementation of this automated workflow offers several advantages over traditional manual methods. Firstly, it effectively reduces technical variations arising from hands-on experiment procedures, thereby enhancing the reliability and reproducibility of miRNA expression data. Moreover, the automation of the process reduces labor time, making it feasible to process a large number of samples simultaneously. One potential method modification that can be considered is the choice of magnetic beads used in the RNA isolation protocol. Currently, magnetic beads-based RNA isolation protocol is specialized for total RNA [<xref rid=""pone.0301733.ref065"" ref-type=""bibr"">65</xref>]. However, it may be beneficial to develop magnetic beads that specifically target small RNAs to further enhance the isolation efficiency and accuracy. Such modification can potentially improve the miRNA detection range and better concordance between isolation methods. In conclusion, our results demonstrated that an automated workflow for miRNA isolation with NanoString nCounter® assay could identify a panel of miRNAs targeting similar hubs of angiogenesis genes as the manual method. These miRNAs can potentially serve as biomarkers for diagnosis, prognosis, surveillance, and even in therapeutic applications. The workflow is applicable to investigate miRNA expression signatures associated with other diseases for biomarker studies. ",N/A,28 10 2024
Human in vitro models for Fabry disease: new paths for unravelling disease mechanisms and therapies,"Fabry disease is a multi-organ disease, caused by mutations in the <italic toggle=""yes"">GLA</italic> gene and leading to a progressive accumulation of glycosphingolipids due to enzymatic absence or malfunction of the encoded alpha-galactosidase A. Since pathomechanisms are not yet fully understood and available treatments are not efficient for all mutation types and tissues, further research is highly needed. This research involves many different model types, with significant effort towards the establishment of an in vivo model. However, these models did not replicate the variety of symptoms observed in patients. As an alternative strategy, patient-derived somatic cells as well as patient-independent cell lines were used to model specific aspects of the disease in vitro. Fabry disease patients present different phenotypes according to the mutation and the level of residual enzyme activity, pointing to the necessity of personalized disease modeling. With the advent of induced pluripotent stem cells, the derivation of a multitude of disease-affected cell types became possible, even in a patient-specific and mutation-specific manner. Only recently, three-dimensional Fabry disease models were established that even more closely resemble the native tissue of investigated organs and will bring research closer to the in vivo situation. This review provides an overview of human in vitro models and their achievements in unravelling the Fabry disease pathomechanism as well as in elucidating current and future treatment strategies.","Fabry disease is a disorder of the glycosphingolipid metabolism. It is a rare, X-linked disease first described [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR1"">1</xref>] in 1898 as a variation of exanthema occurring in different densities and colors, and therefore also named <italic toggle=""yes"">Angiokeratoma corporis diffusum</italic> [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR2"">2</xref>, <xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR3"">3</xref>]. The disease is caused by mutations in the <italic toggle=""yes"">GLA</italic> gene, located on the X-chromosome and encoding the enzyme α-galactosidase A (α-Gal A), which catalyzes the hydrolysis of globotriaosylceramide (Gb3) [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR4"">4</xref>]. The deficiency of this enzyme leads to a progressive accumulation of Gb3 and other neutral glycosphingolipids inside the cells, which are the suspected cause for the manifold clinical manifestations that progress over time [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR5"">5</xref>]. The accumulation of Gb3 in the lysosomes affects the whole body, and Fabry is considered a multi-systemic disease [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR6"">6</xref>]. The main symptoms of Fabry disease are diverse and include angiokeratomas, sweating abnormalities (hyper- or hypohidrosis, anhidrosis), lymphedema [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR7"">7</xref>], acroparesthesias, hearing loss, tinnitus, proteinuria, renal failure, arrhythmias, angina, left ventricular hypertrophy, strokes, abdominal pain and diarrhoea[<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR5"">5</xref>, <xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR8"">8</xref>] (Fig. <xref rid=""Fig1"" ref-type=""fig"">1</xref>).<fig id=""Fig1""><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>Main symptoms of Fabry disease</p></caption><graphic http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink href=""12967_2024_5756_Fig1_HTML"" id=""MO1""></graphic></fig> The incidence of Fabry disease has been estimated to range between 1 in 40,000 and 1 in 117,000 births [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR5"">5</xref>, <xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR9"">9</xref>], although the number varies depending on the geographical region assessed, and can be as high as 1 in 3,100 male births [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR10"">10</xref>]. Mutations can vary from point mutations to rearrangements in any region of the <italic toggle=""yes"">GLA</italic> gene [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR4"">4</xref>] and around 57% of mutations are missense [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR11"">11</xref>]. Mutations can cause either a more severe phenotype with enzyme activity levels being less than 5% of the normal mean, referred to as classical phenotype or cause a milder phenotype with higher residual enzyme activity [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR12"">12</xref>, <xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR13"">13</xref>]. In both cases, a single point mutation is sufficient to produce the phenotype [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR13"">13</xref>] while for most mutations, there is no clear genotype–phenotype correlation [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR14"">14</xref>]. Even if the disease affects the body as a whole, some organs are more affected than others. One of the main organs involved in worsening their life quality is the heart. The Gb3 accumulation in the cardiomyocytes is thought to contribute to the development of cardiac hypertrophy and the involvement of the conduction system contributes to the development of arrhythmias [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR4"">4</xref>]. Whether these are direct or secondary effects is still not understood. Nevertheless, cardiac manifestations can arise at early age, with children clearly showing signs of cardiac involvement, such as left ventricular hypertrophy [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR15"">15</xref>]. In severe cardiac hypertrophy, the wet weight of glycosphingolipid deposits can be as high as 2% of total heart weight [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR16"">16</xref>]. This excessive storage is hypothesized to activate secondary cellular pathways that may lead to apoptosis, autophagy, necrosis and fibrosis [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR4"">4</xref>]. Two different treatment options are currently available, and the earlier treatment is initiated, the lower is the risk of severe organ damage. Enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) was approved in Europe and the USA in 2001 and 2002, respectively [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR17"">17</xref>]. The early treatment start can delay or mitigate the effects of the Gb3 accumulation, especially in the kidney and the heart [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR18"">18</xref>]. After treatment, patients showed a reduction in the concentration of Gb3 in the plasma [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR19"">19</xref>, <xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR20"">20</xref>], liver, skin, kidney and heart [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR21"">21</xref>], along with a reduction of left ventricular hypertrophy [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR22"">22</xref>]. Data show that long-term treatment can prolong survival and reduce the risk of serious clinical events [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR20"">20</xref>]. It has also been suggested that ERT can influence on circulating miRNA levels and could help understand the disease pattern and which processes would be involved in improving the symptoms [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR23"">23</xref>]. The second treatment option is a chaperone therapy with migalastat [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR24"">24</xref>]. This treatment option has many beneficial effects that are similar to the enzyme replacement therapy, with reduction of Gb3 in the kidney and reduction of left ventricular hypertrophy [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR25"">25</xref>]. Chaperone therapy could also be used in combination with enzyme replacement therapy [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR26"">26</xref>]. However, it is restricted to certain amenable mutations and is therefore only available to a subset of patients. Further treatment options are currently under development including substrate reduction, gene and mRNA therapies. mRNA therapy has been shown to increase the levels of human α-Gal A in heart and kidneys of healthy and Fabry mice using LNPs as a delivery system [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR27"">27</xref>]. This therapy uses pharmacological intervention to inhibit the biosynthesis of the substrate that will cause the accumulation. In Fabry disease, lucerastat, a glucosylceramide synthase inhibitor, has been studied for its efficacy [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR28"">28</xref>] (NCT02228460) in reducing the precursors of Gb3 [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR29"">29</xref>]. The development of gene therapies with the aim of targeting cells that could overexpress α-Gal A, and subsequently secrete it to peripheral organs [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR24"">24</xref>] are ongoing. Lentivirus-mediated gene therapy in Fabry patients with classical phenotype has shown to increase circulating and intracellular α-Gal A activity [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR30"">30</xref>]. Although there are promising novel therapeutic approaches, further research is needed to better understand the disease mechanisms, develop therapies that target difficult to reach tissues and create adjuvant therapies that address secondary cellular processes caused by the enzyme deficiency. Research on Fabry disease involves various model types, with a significant focus on developing an in vivo model. One such model is the <italic toggle=""yes"">GLA</italic> knockout mouse model, which demonstrated no Gb3 accumulation in the heart spleen and lungs, but could identify zebra bodies in kidneys and liver [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR31"">31</xref>]. <italic toggle=""yes"">GLA-</italic>KO mice have also been used for investigation of pain and angiogenesis in normoxia and hypoxia conditions [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR32"">32</xref>]. Another mouse model involves expressing a human mutant α-Gal A in mice with a <italic toggle=""yes"">GLA</italic> knockout background, along with overexpressing a Gb3 synthase and serve as a model to study active-site-specific chaperon therapy [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR33"">33</xref>]. These mice showed Gb3 accumulation in their kidneys, similar to the other model [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR34"">34</xref>], but also showed a lower level of Gb3 accumulation in the heart, which could only be achieved by the overexpression of human α1,4-galactosyltransferase to increase the production of Gb3. This effort, albeit valid, still does not reflect the patient situation. A <italic toggle=""yes"">GLA</italic> knockout rat model showed a similar pattern of glycosphingolipid accumulation in serum [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR35"">35</xref>]. These also developed neuropathic pain and showed accumulation of neutral glycosphingolipids in dorsal root ganglia [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR34"">34</xref>], as well as in kidney cells and the heart of aged rats [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR36"">36</xref>]. The rat model also presents alterations in skin and [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR32"">32</xref>]anomalies in the sebaceous ducts. However, these rats did not develop left ventricular hypertrophy, but rather wall thinning and presented other limitations such as lack of vascular pathology. These data show that in vivo models do not fully reflect the range of symptoms associated with Fabry disease, presumably owing to their relatively short lifespan compared to humans. Therefore, in vitro models that focus on specific cell types may help to address some of these gaps. The cultivation of cells in vitro offers many advantages, including less bureaucracy and greater flexibility than in vivo studies. It also allows for the direct study of human cells, which can help to address translational concerns. These models also enable the use of the CRISPR/Cas9 system to create isogenic controls for diseases that derive from a genetic mutation [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR37"">37</xref>]. This review summarizes human in vitro models of Fabry disease that are based on patient-derived cells, patient-independent cell lines or on pluripotent stem cells, including three-dimensional disease models. This variety of models is crucial for validating new therapies and offers hope for individuals with Fabry disease. The studies in Fabry disease included in this review were identified using Pubmed, ScienceDirect or in the individual websites of the respective Journals between January 2023 and April 2024 by using the search terms “Fabry disease” “Anderson-Fabry disease”, “fabry disease model”, “fabry disease in vivo models” and “Fabry disease in vitro models” either alone or in combination.",N/A,24 10 2024
Quality of life and unmet needs in patients with fabry disease: a qualitative study,,"Fabry disease (FD) is a rare X-linked lysosomal storage disorder characterized by deficiency of the lysosomal enzyme α-galactosidase A (α-Gal A, E.C. 3.2.1.22), which causes a systemic accumulation of globotriaosylceramide (Gb3) and related glycosphingolipids in lysosomes in cells throughout the body. The prevalence is estimated to be 1 per 40,000–170,000 live births. The incidence of this rare disease is underestimated due to delayed diagnosis [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR1"">1</xref>, <xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR2"">2</xref>]. Two types of FD can be distinguished: the classical form, which is the most severe phenotype due to very low or absent α-galactosidase A activity with the onset of symptoms during childhood and predominantly affecting men and the non-classical form, also referred to as late-onset, characterized by residual enzyme activity and presentation during adulthood. Women can be as severely affected as male patients with classic FD, but most of them have a more variable and attenuated phenotype. This is why they are usually categorized as non-classical patients [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR3"">3</xref>]. The initial symptoms in both male and female patients affected by the classical form include angiokeratoma, anhidrosis (absence of sweating), neuropathic pain, cornea <italic toggle=""yes"">verticillata</italic> (gray or golden deposits in the epithelium) and gastrointestinal symptoms. As the disease evolves, progressive kidney failure, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, cardiac rhythm disturbances, and strokes may develop. In male patients with the non-classical form and in most women, a more attenuated and variable course of the disease is observed. The life expectancy and morbidity of patients are significantly associated with the degree of damage to the affected organs [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR4"">4</xref>–<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR8"">8</xref>]. Although enzyme replacement therapy currently exists and has shown beneficial effects on neuropathic pain, heart mass, and kidney function, complications of the disease can still occur [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR9"">9</xref>, <xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR10"">10</xref>]. In this sense, patients suffering from this disease have a lower quality of life compared to healthy individuals, especially related to neuropathic pain and anhidrosis. These results are observed both with general and disease-specific quality of life questionnaires [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR11"">11</xref>]. On the other hand, enzyme replacement therapy has a positive effect on quality of life [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR12"">12</xref>, <xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR13"">13</xref>]. The majority of studies involving patients diagnosed with Fabry disease evaluate quality of life using quantitative measures and standardized scales that offer relevant information about experience with the disease in multiple aspects [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR11"">11</xref>]. However, complementing this knowledge with the use of qualitative methodologies would help to further explore the specific needs and concerns of this group of patients, their relatives, and, consequently, the socio-health agents involved in the care administered for this disease. To our knowledge, there are very few studies focused on patients with Fabry disease and their relatives that explore their quality of life from a qualitative perspective [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR14"">14</xref>–<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR16"">16</xref>]. The main objective of the research was to thoroughly examine the quality of life and the unmet needs of patients diagnosed with Fabry disease in Spain in relation to their disease and treatment.  The main results obtained from the testimonies collected in the interviews are structured and described in the next section.

 A qualitative and transversal study was carried out with FD patients, relatives, and one representative of the local patient association, with the main objective of examining in depth the quality of life and unmet needs of patients diagnosed with FD in Spain in relation to their disease and treatment. Even if the majority of studies involving patients diagnosed with Fabry disease evaluate quality of life using quantitative measures and standardised scales, complementing this knowledge with the use of qualitative methodologies would help to further explore the specific needs and concerns of this group of patients, their relatives, and, consequently, the socio-health agents involved in the care administered for this disease. One of the findings of the study is that the symptoms and evolution of the disease are highly variable among the patients interviewed and depend on the years diagnosed as well as the time taken to receive the diagnosis. Until they were diagnosed with Fabry disease, the participants went to see several specialists. The diagnostic process, or diagnostic journey, is a painful experience in most cases. Only half of the participants are satisfied with their medical team, while the others expressed their discomfort due to the lack of communication, little empathy, limited information and coordination between professionals, as well as the lack of training of some doctors. Most of the interviewees have been forced to look for other specialists in the private sector, especially in the case of mental health professionals. The scarcity and/or poor communication of health professionals and their inability to provide patients with a comprehensive prognosis are a constant source of concern, frustration, and disappointment for both the patients themselves and their families [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR19"">19</xref>, <xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR20"">20</xref>]. Diagnosis is a moment of great impact, both for one’s own health and for that of loved ones, and it is also a disease that is difficult for others to understand. The patients reported that the disease entails a great emotional shock that usually manifests itself with the presence of anxious-depressive symptoms that include everything from apathy, loneliness, guilt, frustration, and sleep problems. The identification and diagnosis of a rare disease not only have important psychological consequences for patients and their families, but it is also key to starting the appropriate therapeutic recommendations as early as possible. Diagnosis provides important prognostic information, correct genetic counselling regarding recurrence risk, and predictive testing in relatives [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR21"">21</xref>]. In this sense, it is advisable to improve the training of specialists and the communication between them. Interdisciplinary support strategies for the diagnosis of rare diseases must be promoted and translational research facilitated, which would allow a faster diagnosis of patients and guarantee better care for this group [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR21"">21</xref>]. Regarding the emotional impact of the environment, the families of the interviewees have to go through an adjustment process in light of the significant psychological impact brought about by the disease. These rare diseases have a considerable impact on the quality of life of not only patients but also of their families, who may notice a great impact on their social, professional, and family lives [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR22"">22</xref>]. Likewise, there is a shift in some expectations, and at times, there is a change in family roles. This adjustment leads to a process of transformation in the person, materialising a change of life [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR23"">23</xref>]. Some patients reported cognitive impairment, specifically affecting processing speed, attention, and memory, although they do not know whether these are related to Fabry disease. Fabry disease appears to be associated with cognitive impairment, specifically in executive functioning, information processing speed, and attention. The preserved domains are general intellectual functioning, memory, naming, perceptual functioning, and global cognitive functioning. In this sense, severe cerebrovascular disease, such as stroke or dementia, and psychological disorders such as depression can likely affect cognitive functioning in Fabry disease [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR24"">24</xref>]. As described above, the main challenges that patients face are: understanding the disease, leading a normal life, social misunderstandings, as well as emotionally managing the disease. The scientific literature reflects how people with rare genetic health conditions feel socially excluded by friends and family [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR25"">25</xref>]. Since people believe that they will suffer discrimination due to their illness or due to a lack of understanding of their condition, sometimes combined with health-related stigma, patients can adopt strategies that minimise the risk of rejection, such as keeping their health status a secret [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR26"">26</xref>]. It seems necessary to carry out actions to raise awareness of the disease that are aimed at the general public, the patients themselves, and the people around them, focused on giving it visibility by means of patient testimonies that describe the reality of their everyday lives with Fabry disease. Other challenges that the patients had to face were related to social, work, and educational fields, in addition to relationships with family and partners. Similar results have been found in previous studies with people with rare diseases [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR25"">25</xref>]. The fact that Fabry is an “invisible” disease to the normal eye makes it more difficult for general people to understand its impact and complications for the patient. In specific areas, such as the educational system, families of children with the disease stress that it is important to establish communication channels with schools and to sensitise both teachers and other students about the disease and its consequences, especially in relation to physical activity [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR16"">16</xref>, <xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR25"">25</xref>]. In terms of partners, most of the participants in the study report that their sexual relationships have been affected as a result of the disease. Sexual well-being is not adequately addressed with people with a rare disease, and it is an issue that affects the quality of life and well-being of the affected people and relationships with partners [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR16"">16</xref>, <xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR27"">27</xref>]. In relation to parenthood, the interviewees show great concern when thinking about having children, and they anxiously await the results of the genetic tests of their children. In that sense, the role of genetic counselling is essential to providing information and personalised support to patients with rare diseases. However, the current situation of genetic counselling for rare diseases in our context is jeopardized by the lack of recognition of Clinical Genetics as a healthcare specialty within the national health system [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR28"">28</xref>]. Additionally, it would be important to provide information and guidance on assisted reproduction techniques for these patients so that they can have better resources and high-quality information about family planning. Underlining some of the aspects mentioned above, the patients especially highlighted various unmet needs with respect to their illness, which included: increasing the speed of diagnosis; greater training of specialists; having access to treatment from the moment of diagnosis; the creation of a single patient registry; and greater knowledge of the disease in society, among others. These issues and similar ones have been widely debated as primary needs to be addressed within European policies and plans in order to ensure that patients with rare diseases have access to high-quality care, including diagnostics and treatments for those living with the disease [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR29"">29</xref>–<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR32"">32</xref>]. Regarding the resources used by patients to better cope with the disease, the participants give a wide variety of responses: pharmacological treatment, family and friends, a team of trusted health professionals, and acceptance of the disease with a positive attitude. Unanimously, patient associations are a much-appreciated resource that offers emotional support and invaluable tools to patients. It is an opportunity to share experiences, interact with other patients, and make them feel safe, supported, and at ease. Patient organisations can often be the only accessible source of up-to-date and reliable information on the disease. They also offer essential support to patients, especially those who have recently been diagnosed, by guiding them through the healthcare system and giving them someone to talk to [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR19"">19</xref>]. It is advisable to facilitate access to mental health professionals for patients and their families, as psychological support is the service that is most in demand for the participants. Regarding the experience of patients with pharmacological treatment, all patients taking part in the study state that they have had a good or very good experience with enzyme replacement therapy, associating it with benefits and delayed symptoms. However, it is important to note that patients express that there are access difficulties to treatment depending on the community of residence. According to the 2022 AELMHU access report, of the total 146 orphan drugs with marketing authorization in the EU, only 43% of them (63) are financed by the SNS in Spain. In addition, of the 63 financed drugs, 48% (30) have restrictions, that is, limitation on indications or unfunded indications [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR33"">33</xref>]. In general, patients show a preference for home administration of the treatment, as it allows them to better conciliate the treatment with their work lives. They consider the necessity of accessing treatment from the moment of diagnosis and that the home treatment administration service would be available in all hospitals. However, some participants are concerned because, in some cases, this service will be withdrawn without being offered alternatives. Those who receive medication in the hospital mention that each administration takes at least 3–5 h of their time, which significantly impacts their personal and work lives. However, the experience in the hospital is good and they positively value having the opportunity to express themselves, to have emotional support by being in contact with other patients, as well as the possibility of being assisted in case potential complications occur [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR34"">34</xref>]. Although this study describes the needs and perceptions of patients and relatives with Fabry disease in detail, it must be considered that it also has a series of limitations. First of all, this study focuses exclusively on a qualitative methodology, and we suggest that future studies use a mixed methodology, applying validated questionnaires that support qualitative measures, including general and specific questionnaires. Other limitation of the study was the small sample size. In terms of the sociodemographic characteristics of the sample, this study has not considered the different classic or non-classic forms of the disease, severity, or genotype. Gender has been considered so that both men and women are represented, although this variable could be further explored. The findings of this study must be considered as knowledge to be taken into account in clinical practice as well as in legislative measures that promote policies in order to bring about a better quality of life for this group of patients. The themes described throughout the study can also be used by other professionals and scientists when applying intervention programmes, taking the specific needs of this disease into account. On the other hand, it involves the acquisition of knowledge that may be useful for the development or improvement of the few quantitative assessment questionnaires regarding quality of life specific to Fabry disease, as well as measurement of the patient-reported outcomes and experience of health. These specific measures are also essential in order to efficiently assess evaluation and intervention strategies from the perspective of quality of life as well as cost-benefit analysis. Patients with Fabry disease and their relatives are forced to deal with a condition that affects their quality of life, including associated symptoms, the diagnostic process, medical care, treatment, and the course of the disease. In addition, patients perceive a lack of understanding from the social environment, including work and educational areas, among others. The results of this study draw attention to the need to gain more knowledge of this disease as well as to provide support resources based on the needs of these patients, including access to psychological professional support, which will help improve their quality of life and promote disease management and treatment.

"Resistive index of central retinal artery, aortic arterial stiffness and OCTA correlated parameters in the early stage of fabry disease","This study aimed to evaluate the impact of Fabry disease (FD) on retinal microvasculature using optical coherence tomography angiography (OCTA), arterial stiffness, and the resistive index (RI) of the central retinal artery (CRA) in early disease stages. Twenty-nine genetically confirmed FD patients and twenty-six healthy controls were enrolled. Vessel density (VD) values of the superficial, deep, and choriocapillaris plexuses (SCP, DCP, and CC) were measured via OCTA. CRA RI was studied using color Doppler and grayscale sonography, and aortic pulse wave velocity (PWV) was assessed with the Complior method. CRA RI was significantly lower in the control group compared to the Fabry group (p < 0.001). Central VD was found to be significantly higher in the control group compared to the Fabry group in all the retinal layers (SCP (p < 0.001), DCP (p < 0.005), CC (p < 0.001)). PWV was significantly higher in the Fabry group than in the control group (p = 0.03). Fabry disease patients demonstrate elevated arterial stiffness, increased CRA RI, and diminished retinal microvascular density compared to healthy controls, indicating early ocular damage. Continuous monitoring and targeted screening for organ impairment are crucial in FD management. Identifying biomarkers for assessing ocular vascular involvement and treatment response is imperative. Further research is needed.","Fabry disease (FD) is an X-linked lysosomal storage disease caused by pathogenic variants in the galactosidase alpha (GLA) gene<sup><xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR1"">1</xref>,<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR2"">2</xref></sup>. It leads to the cumulative deposition of unmetabolized glycosphingolipids within the lysosomes of various tissues<sup><xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR3"">3</xref>,<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR4"">4</xref></sup>. This scenario is thought to cause inflammation in several organs, including the eyes<sup><xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR5"">5</xref>,<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR6"">6</xref></sup>. Multiorgan involvement may complicate the clinical picture, creating diagnostic delays and worsening the morbidity and mortality associated with this disease. Indeed, it is critical for FD patients to have a precise diagnosis, followed by quick and successful therapy before permanent end-organ damage develops<sup><xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR7"">7</xref>,<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR8"">8</xref></sup>. Ocular evidence of FD, such as cornea verticillata, subcapsular cataract development, and vascular tortuosity of the conjunctival and retinal vessels, can be noticed prior to or concurrent with systemic symptoms and can aid in the diagnosis<sup><xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR9"">9</xref>,<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR10"">10</xref></sup>. Tortuosity and aneurysmal dilatations in retinal vessels are typical signs of the illness and are thought to be produced by glycosphingolipid formation in the tunica media of the tiny vessels and endothelial cells<sup><xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR11"">11</xref></sup>. Optical coherence tomography angiography (OCTA) provides for non-invasive quantitative analysis of vascular alterations in the retina. The OCTA method can assess the density of retinal vascular plexuses and radial peripapillary capillaries<sup><xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR12"">12</xref></sup>. These measures assist clinicians in evaluating retinal microvascular changes in a variety of illnesses<sup><xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR13"">13</xref>,<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR14"">14</xref></sup>. Several studies have found a link between Fabry disease and arterial stiffness. Arterial stiffness refers to the loss of arterial elasticity, resulting in decreased compliance of the arterial walls. Arterial stiffness in patients with Fabry disease has been analysed using a non-invasive method called pulse wave velocity<sup><xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR15"">15</xref></sup>. The researchers found that patients with Fabry disease had significantly higher pulse wave velocity values, indicating increased arterial stiffness compared to healthy individuals. The resistive index (RI) is a measure used in ophthalmology to assess vascular resistance in the central retinal artery. Color Doppler and gray scale sonography allow the visualization of the blood flow and morphology of the retrobulbar vessels. They can be useful for assessing the hemodynamic changes associated with various ocular diseases, such as glaucoma, diabetic retinopathy, and retinal vascular occlusion<sup><xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR16"">16</xref></sup>. Moreover, so far, no data on RI of central retinal artery in patients affected by Fabry disease has been reported in literature. This study aims to assess the effect of FD on the retinal microvasculature, arterial stiffness and the resistive index of the central retinal artery, in the early stage of the disease.  Twenty-nine patients diagnosed with FD and referred to the Azienda Ospedaliera dei Colli Monaldi Hospital were included, alongside 26 age-matched healthy controls. The inclusion criteria required an established diagnosis of FD with genetic testing, accompanied by indicative signs or symptoms, and participants aged over 18 years. Written informed consent was obtained from the patients. Proof of informed consent is available upon request. Diagnosis can be achieved by the α-GAL A enzyme activity assay on several sample matrix types (dried blood spot DBS, peripheral white blood cells or plasma) and/or by molecular analysis. The samples were analyzed for α-GAL A enzyme activity using a multiplex MS/MS assay (PerkinElmer, Turku, Finland). Assay results were obtained after overnight incubation and enzyme activity was expressed as micromoles of substrate hydrolyzed per hour of incubation per liter of blood (µmol/L/h). For the samples with low activities confirmatory testing included molecular analysis. The GLA gene was sequenced using Next Generation Sequencing technology on genomic DNA isolated from peripheral leukocytes. Variants were classified according to published clinical reports and public databases including the International Fabry Disease Genotype-Phenotype Database and The Fabry Working Group Genotype Phenotype Database [International Fabry Disease Genotype-Phenotype Database. Available online: <ext-link ext-link-type=""uri"" http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink href=""http://www.dbfgp.org"">www.dbfgp.org</ext-link><italic toggle=""yes"">].</italic> Genetic counselling framework was offered and performed on the patients and his relatives. Exclusion criteria encompassed the presence of comorbidities such as diabetes, atherosclerotic vasculopathy, glaucoma, or any macular or retinal disorders, as well as optical media opacity that could compromise the reliability of retinal functional assessments. All images were acquired after pupil dilation using 1.0% tropicamide eyedrops. Assessment of SS-OCT and OCTA data was investigated to ascertain retinal and choroidal thickness (CT) along with vessel density (VD), employing the swept-source Topcon DRI OCT Triton (Topcon Corporation, Japan). Amidst all subjects, only the eye featuring the highest image quality scan was utilized for the study. The acquisition protocol included a macular line scan and a 6 × 6 mm macular cube scan for both OCT and OCTA. Each scan was centered on the fovea, and the IMAGENET 6.0 automated layer detection tool was applied to define retinal layers for analysis of the superficial capillary plexus (SCP), deep capillary plexus (DCP), and choriocapillaris (CC). 3D datasets were scrutinized to determine retinal thickness and VD within the five ETDRS sectors (central, nasal, temporal, inferior, and superior). Only images with a quality score greater than 50 were considered acceptable and consequently comprised in the final analysis. VD was settled as the proportion of the total area covered by blood vessels. When using OCTA on the Topcon DRI OCT Triton, the unit of measurement is typically indicated as a dimensionless ratio or percentage. This metric assess the concentration of blood vessels within a specific sector of interest in the scanned tissue, representing the relative extent of the analyzed area occupied by blood vessels. This unit of measurement coordinates steadly with the established method for characterizing vessel density in OCTA imaging between different devices and platforms. The OCTA software produced vessel densities for each scan within the identical ETDRS regions outlined in our study protocol. The OCTA signal was identified and recorded for every ETDRS region, overlaid onto each OCTA en-face layer. Consequently, the average normalized VD of the full-thickness retina and the choriocapillaris in each ETDRS region was extrapolated from every subject, enabling further analysis. The resistive index (RI) of the central retinal artery (CRA) is a sonographic parameter that reflects the vascular resistance and blood flow in the retina. It is calculated as the difference between the peak systolic velocity (PSV) and the end-diastolic velocity (EDV) divided by the PSV. (Boote 2003) To measure the RI of the CRA, a high-frequency linear probe (7.5–10 MHz) is used to locate the ophthalmic artery (OA) along the medial border of the medial rectus muscle. The OA is then followed until it bifurcates into the CRA and the posterior ciliary artery. A 2–3 mm sample window is placed on the CRA and the spectral Doppler signal is recorded<sup><xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR17"">17</xref></sup>. The aortic PWV is a measure of arterial stiffness that reflects the elasticity and distensibility of the aorta. It is calculated as the ratio of the distance travelled by the pulse wave along the aorta to the time it takes to travel that distance<sup><xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR18"">18</xref></sup>. The Complior method is a non-invasive technique that uses two pressure transducers applied on the skin over the common carotid and femoral arteries. The transducers detect the pulse waves at both sites and send them to a computer that records the waveforms and calculates the transit time between them. The distance between the two transducers is measured using a tape measure and corrected by a factor of 0.8 to account for the tortuosity of the aorta<sup><xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR19"">19</xref></sup>. The primary outcome was centered on evaluating the differences between the two groups across the parameters of CRA RI, SCP cVD, DCP cVD, CC cVD, and PWV. Secondary outcomes involved investigating the relationship of each of these variables between the FD patient and healthy control groups. A total of 55 eyes were included in this investigation, 29 from individuals diagnosed with Fabry disease and 26 from healthy control subjects. The mean age was 45.07 (SD = 8.15) years, with a gender distribution of 56.4% female and 43.6% male. Statistical analysis revealed no significant differences in age or gender between the two groups (<italic toggle=""yes"">p</italic> = 0.074 and <italic toggle=""yes"">p</italic> = 0.79, respectively) (Table <xref rid=""Tab1"" ref-type=""table"">1</xref>).

 CRA RI was significantly lower in the control group compared to the Fabry group (<italic toggle=""yes"">p</italic> < 0.001). The regression model indicated that the CRA RI in the Fabry group was estimated to have a mean increase of 0.22 units compared to the control group (95% CI [0.1; 0.27]) (<italic toggle=""yes"">p</italic> < 0.001). This finding is visualized in the boxplot in Fig. <xref rid=""Fig1"" ref-type=""fig"">1</xref>. A subgroup linear regression analysis was performed to compare CRA RI in Fabry patients with and without ocular vascular findings, specifically retinal and conjunctival vessel tortuosity. The analysis revealed no statistically significant difference in CRA RI between Fabry patients with and without retinal vessel tortuosity (β = -0.02, 95% CI [-0.1, 0.07], <italic toggle=""yes"">p</italic> = 0.7). The regression model demonstrated a very low R-squared value (R² = 0.005). Similarly, no significant difference was observed in CRA RI between Fabry patients with and without conjunctival vessel tortuosity (β = 0.01, 95% CI [-0.08, 0.09], <italic toggle=""yes"">p</italic> = 0.9). This model also showed an extremely low R-squared value (R² = 0.0008).

 Patients with Fabry disease exhibit vascular injuries affecting heart, brain, kidneys, and retina<sup><xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR20"">20</xref></sup>. The pathophysiology of this vasculopathy remains incompletely elucidated, with current hypotheses suggesting endothelial dysfunctions, alterations in cerebral perfusion, and a pro-thrombotic phenotype arising from alpha-galactosidase A deficiency<sup><xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR21"">21</xref></sup>. In patients with Fabry disease, diverse ocular manifestations have been observed, with occasional findings indicating vascular occlusive disorders arising from compromised choroidal and retinal vasculature<sup><xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR6"">6</xref></sup>. The objective of this study is to investigate vascular differences between Fabry patients and healthy controls, encompassing for the first time not only arterial stiffness but also exploring ocular aspects through the assessment of retinal angiopathy (specifically CSP-VD, DCP-VD, and CC-VD) and retinal arterial compromise (RI-CRA), using reliable non-invasive methods. In our analysis, arterial stiffness resulted higher in the Fabry group than in the control group, aligning with findings from several prior studies<sup><xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR22"">22</xref></sup>. This observation correlates with an increased incidence of cardiovascular events and challenges in peripheral microcirculation in this particular patient population<sup><xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR23"">23</xref></sup>. Alterations in arterial stiffness and blood pressure metrics are increasingly investigated, suggesting a potential role not only in delaying the decline in kidney functions but also in contributing to retinal neurodegeneration<sup><xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR24"">24</xref>,<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR25"">25</xref></sup>. Comparison of data between the two cohorts, FD and controls, revealed a significant decrease in VD across the superficial, deep, and choriocapillaris plexuses. Our study identified the choriocapillaris as the most compromised, consistent with the knowledge that it is particularly vulnerable to damage in the presence of systemic diseases involving vascular complications<sup><xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR26"">26</xref>–<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR28"">28</xref></sup>. Alongside alterations in VD, the information obtained through ColorDoppler revealed a noteworthy increase in the resistive index of the central retinal artery in Fabry patients. The resistive index is a measure of vascular resistance, and changes in this index can indicate alterations in blood flow characteristics within the central retinal artery. In diabetic retinopathy increased vascular resistance in the central retinal artery has been investigated and resulted from both macrovascular and microvascular changes associated with the pathology<sup><xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR29"">29</xref></sup>. This elevation is reflective of the compromised retinal circulation and impaired autoregulation in the context of diabetes and has been considered as a bioimaging biomarker for the severity of the disease<sup><xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR16"">16</xref></sup>. In our study, for the first time an increase in the resistive index of the central retinal artery has been registered in Fabry patients, probably due to the glycolipid accumulation leading to structural changes, potentially impacting blood flow dynamics and increasing vascular resistance. Investigating and comparing RI changes in the central retinal artery can contribute to a deeper understanding of the vascular alterations specific to the analysed condition. It’s essential to consider the potential implications of RI changes in guiding treatment strategies and predicting the risk of vision-related complications, such as the risk of thrombosis, which encompasses central retinal artery occlusion and retinal vein occlusion<sup><xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR30"">30</xref>–<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR32"">32</xref></sup>. Notably, the individuals under examination did not exhibit symptomatic ocular complications; rather, the sole indicators of ocular vasculopathy were observed in the form of conjunctival vessel tortuosity (in 19 patients) and retinal vessel tortuosity (in 15 patients). In essence, these patients could be characterized from an ocular standpoint as being in a subclinical stage. The highlighted alteration in VD prompts consideration of the potential value in longitudinally monitoring these individuals. Eco ColorDoppler and OCTA emerge as early preferences, offering non-invasive and cost-effective means to delineate vascular changes in the absence of overt pathology. A key advantage of our study is the use of Color Doppler imaging, which provides additional information about blood flow quality and tissue perfusion in the eyes. This method can be particularly beneficial in cases with media opacities, where other imaging techniques might be limited. In addition, while OCTA is valuable for mapping the structure and density of retinal vessels, it does not provide insight into blood flow dynamics. In contrast, Color Doppler can measure blood velocity and arterial resistance, which are early indicators of vascular changes that may precede structural alterations detectable by OCTA. This study is subject to certain limitations, notably the relatively small number of patients analyzed, a factor attributed to the rarity of the disease. Additionally, the short-term follow-up period raises a need for further investigations to evaluate longitudinal changes and potential correlations between ocular alterations and the emergence of signs and symptoms of pathology. Despite these limitations, the study gains strength from its innovative approach, employing for the first time a combination of eco ColorDoppler and OCTA in Fabry patients. In conclusion, our study has revealed that FD patients exhibit not only the anticipated significant increase in arterial stiffness compared to healthy subjects but also an elevation in the resistive index of the central retinal artery and a reduction in retinal microvasculature density. These findings suggest the presence of subclinical ocular damage in these patients, underscoring the importance of ongoing monitoring. A focused screening for organ damage in FD patients is strongly recommended, emphasizing the necessity to identify parameters that can serve as pivotal benchmarks in assessing ocular vascular involvement. Such non-invasive bioimaging biomarkers might also serve to monitor the latest therapies available for Fabry patients, such as the enzyme replacement therapy, to assess treatment response and adjust therapy as needed. Certainly, further studies are needed to elucidate how variations in these parameters over time are associated with the pathology progression.

Investigation of serum neurofilament light chain as a biomarker in Fabry disease,"Fabry disease (FD) constitutes a rare, X-linked lysosomal storage disorder affecting multiple organ systems, most notably heart, kidneys, and the central nervous system. Neurofilament light chains (NfL) have emerged as a prime candidate for a body fluid biomarker reflecting neuro-axonal injury. We aimed to evaluate its addition to the diagnostic and monitoring armamentarium in FD. Serum NfL concentrations (sNfL) were measured in 50 people with FD (PwFD) and 30 healthy control subjects (HC) using the Simoa© technology, followed by calculation of Z-scores adjusted for age and body mass index. In addition, clinical disease severity in PwFD was measured using the FOS-MSSI (Fabry outcome study – Mainz severity score index), which comprises clinical and paraclinical parameters. PwFD show elevated sNfL Z-scores compared to HC (PwFD: 1.12 [SD 1.5], HC: 0.01 [SD 1.2], <italic toggle=""yes"">p</italic> < 0.001). In PwFD, males showed higher sNfL Z-scores than females (1.75 [SD 1.5] vs. 0.73 [SD 1.4]). Importantly, sNfL Z-scores were increased in PwFD with ischemic white matter lesions of the CNS (1.5, SD 2.2 vs. 0.5, SD 2.9, <italic toggle=""yes"">p</italic> = 0.03). In our small cohort, sNfL Z-scores correlated fairly with FOS-MSSI (Kendall’s-Tau [τ] = 0.25, <italic toggle=""yes"">p</italic> = 0.01), and, interestingly with serum creatinine (τ = 0.28, <italic toggle=""yes"">p</italic> = 0.005) and estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR, τ =-0.28, <italic toggle=""yes"">p</italic> = 0.005). Based on these exploratory results, sNfL might provide value as a biomarker of neuroaxonal damage in FD, possibly reflecting cerebrovascular injury. Additionally, the correlation of sNfL with renal function warrants further investigation.","Fabry disease (FD; OMIM# 301500) is a complex, X-linked lysosomal storage disorder affecting multiple organ systems along a highly variable phenotypic spectrum. Variants in the <italic toggle=""yes"">GLA</italic> gene on Xq22.1 causing deficiency of the hydroxylase α-galactosidase A result in the accumulation of sphingolipids and their metabolites, mainly globotriaosylceramide (Gb-3) and globotriaosylsphingosine (Lyso-Gb<sub>3</sub>). This, in turn, induces metabolic dysfunction and ultimately damage to vasculature, central and peripheral nervous system (PNS, CNS), heart and kidneys, among other organ systems<sup><xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR1"">1</xref></sup>. Despite the X-linked inheritance, the disease burden in females reaches from asymptomatic to severe affection comparable to males, a fact that is attributed to skewed X-inactivation, the mechanism of which is subject of ongoing debate<sup><xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR2"">2</xref>,<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR3"">3</xref></sup>. The incidence of FD was previously reported to be 1:117 000 <sup><xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR4"">4</xref></sup>, whereas more recent accounts from a European new born screening suggest a more common incidence of α-galactosidase deficiency of about 1:8000 <sup><xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR5"">5</xref></sup>. The main neurological disease manifestations include cerebrovascular pathology with stroke, as well as peripheral neuropathy including small-fiber neuropathy<sup><xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR7"">7</xref></sup>. Additionally, studies hinted on FD-patients being increasingly affected by microstructural white matter changes, neurodegenerative changes, as well as cognitive dysfunction and depression<sup><xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR8"">8</xref>–<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR10"">10</xref></sup>. After establishing the diagnosis, two disease-specific forms of therapy are available: (i) three different formulations of intravenous enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) and (ii) an oral chaperone therapy. Both have shown efficacy in reducing disease burden and improving quality of life, as well as prevention of disease progression with stabilization of organ dysfunction and enhancement of lifespan<sup><xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR11"">11</xref>–<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR15"">15</xref></sup>. In PwFD, regular follow-up appointments including blood tests, imaging, ultrasound and clinical examinations are required to guarantee standard of care in the outpatient setting<sup><xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR22"">22</xref></sup>. Neurofilament light-chain (NfL), an intermediary filament predominately expressed in myelinated axons and responsible for axonal diameter<sup><xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR16"">16</xref>,<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR17"">17</xref></sup>, has been established as a valuable diagnostic and prognostic tool in many neurological diseases in recent years<sup><xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR18"">18</xref></sup>. The advent of fourth-generation detection assays now allows reliable detection of NfL in peripheral blood (serum or plasma), thus markedly facilitating sample acquisition. Large studies have looked at the distribution of NfL-concentrations in healthy individuals and suggested reference values partitioned for age and body mass index, an important milestone in establishing this biomarker for routine patient care<sup><xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR19"">19</xref>,<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR20"">20</xref></sup>. Additionally, standardized Z-scores adjusted for age and body mass index have been published<sup><xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR21"">21</xref></sup>. This study aimed to investigate the possible value of adding the biomarker sNfL to the diagnostic and monitoring armamentarium in the assessment of neurological disease manifestations in FD. We hypothesized that sNfL are increased in PwFD due to depositions of sphingolipids in all tissues, including peripheral and central nervous system. We analyzed the serum neurofilament light-chain concentration (sNfL) in 50 people with Fabry Disease (PwFD) and 30 healthy controls. Table <xref rid=""Tab1"" ref-type=""table"">1</xref> provides detailed information of both cohorts.

Irrespective of this age-distribution with iWML predominance in older PwFD, however, sNFL Z-scores in PwFD with and without iWML remained significantly increased (1.5, SD 2.2 vs. 0.5, SD 2.9, <italic toggle=""yes"">p</italic> = 0.03, Fig. <xref rid=""Fig2"" ref-type=""fig"">2</xref>B; Table <xref rid=""Tab4"" ref-type=""table"">4</xref>). The difference of sNfL Z-scores in PwFD without iWML and HC was non-significant (0.5, SD 2.9 vs. 0.01, SD 1.2, <italic toggle=""yes"">p</italic> = 0.34).

 Lyso-Gb<sub>3</sub> concentrations were higher in males (13.9 ng/mL, IQR 18.1) than in females (3.4 ng/mL, IQR 3.5, <italic toggle=""yes"">p</italic> < 0.001). Sex-specific analysis yielded no significant correlation of Lyso-Gb3 with sNfL (females: τ = 0.10, p-Value = 0.424; males: τ = 0.22, p-Value = 0.183). While we found significantly lower sNfL absolute values in treatment naïve PwFD (median 9.7 pg/mL, IQR 7.7) compared to those receiving any disease-specific therapy (ERT or chaperone-therapy, 16.3 pg/mL, IQR 20.6, <italic toggle=""yes"">p</italic> = 0.015), this difference failed to achieve significance when analyzing sNfL Z-scores (0.75, SD 1.6 vs. 1.48, SD 1.4; <italic toggle=""yes"">p</italic> = 0.094, Table <xref rid=""Tab4"" ref-type=""table"">4</xref>). PwFD receiving disease-specific therapy were significantly older (49.3 years [SD 12.2] vs. 39.4 years [SD 14.5], <italic toggle=""yes"">p</italic> = 0.012, Table 3) and more severely affected with significantly higher FOS-MSSI (any specific therapy: median 21.0, IQR 16.0, no specific therapy: median 9.0, IQR 8.0, <italic toggle=""yes"">p</italic> < 0.001, Table 3). Similarly, sNfL absolute values in PwFD showed a significant correlation with troponin T (TnT). However, TnT correlated even more strongly with age (data not shown). This is also reflected in the absence of significant group differences of sNfL Z-scores between PwFD with normal, borderline and elevated TnT (Table <xref rid=""Tab4"" ref-type=""table"">4</xref>). There was no appreciable correlation of sNfL Z-scores or absolute sNfL values with duration of therapy (data not shown). Mean sNfL Z-scores in PwFD with and without history of acroparesthesia did not differ significantly (0.9, SD 1.9 vs. 1.1, SD 1.1, <italic toggle=""yes"">p</italic> = 0.679; available for <italic toggle=""yes"">n</italic> = 48 PwFD, Table <xref rid=""Tab4"" ref-type=""table"">4</xref>). While not available in all patients, mean sympathetic skin response latency to upper and lower extremities (SSRU: <italic toggle=""yes"">n</italic> = 36, SSRL: <italic toggle=""yes"">n</italic> = 34, respectively) as a surrogate marker for damage to autonomic nerves showed no correlation with the presence of acroparesthesia or sNfL-concentration in PwFD ( NfL-Z-score: SSRU τ = -0.14, <italic toggle=""yes"">p</italic> = 0.210, SSRL τ = -0.019, <italic toggle=""yes"">p</italic> = 0.870; data on acroparesthesia not shown). SNfL Z-scores were significantly higher in PwFD with renal dysfunction (eGFR < 90mL/min/1.73 m², Table <xref rid=""Tab4"" ref-type=""table"">4</xref>) and correlated significantly with serum-creatinine levels and eGFR (τ = 0.28, <italic toggle=""yes"">p</italic> < 0.01, τ = -0.28, <italic toggle=""yes"">p</italic> < 0.01, Fig. <xref rid=""Fig2"" ref-type=""fig"">2</xref>D). Interestingly, PwFD with iWML had significantly lower eGFR compared to those without iMWL (Table <xref rid=""Tab3"" ref-type=""table"">3</xref>). Absolute sNfL-concentrations show a moderate correlation with age (τ = 0.43, <italic toggle=""yes"">p</italic> < 0.001). Upon analysis of Z-scores, there remained no residual correlation with age above Z-score-standardization (Pearson’s <italic toggle=""yes"">r</italic> = 0.23, p-Value = 0.11). In this exploratory study, we aimed to investigate the potential of sNfL as a diagnostic and monitoring biomarker in FD. In a large and representative cohort of PwFD, we found that sNfL-concentrations were (i) significantly higher in PwFD compared to healthy controls, (ii) significantly higher in PwFD with iWML, and (iii) correlated with clinical and paraclinical parameters of disease severity (FOS-MSSI, Fig. <xref rid=""Fig2"" ref-type=""fig"">2</xref>). These findings are contrary to a small previous study, which found no significant difference in serum NfL levels in 12 female PwFD compared to 12 matched controls. However, sNfL concentrations were determined with ELISA and only one woman with FD was affected severely enough to receive ERT<sup><xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR23"">23</xref></sup>. The different results reported in the current study may be explained by the inclusion of both men and women in our study. Additionally, our cohort was more severely affected, as indicated by the higher number of PwFD receiving disease specific therapy. Thirdly, we utilized the SIMOA technology in our analysis, compared to ELISA. Unsurprisingly, in our study, sNfL was higher in male PwFD compared to female PwFD (Fig. <xref rid=""Fig2"" ref-type=""fig"">2</xref>), fitting the X-linked inheritance pattern. Similarly, the increasing absolute sNfL-concentration with higher age appears easily conceivable for a lysosomal storage disease with accumulation of pathogenic metabolites over time. Upon consideration of sNfL Z-scores, however, no significant correlation above age adjustment was evident. This highlights the importance of incorporating standardized Z-scores into biomarker research, whenever possible. The correlation of sNfL and FOS-MSSI appears equally plausible, although PwFD in the severe FOS-MSSI category were not those with the highest sNfL-concentrations (Table <xref rid=""Tab4"" ref-type=""table"">4</xref>); as our cohort only included 3 PwFD in this group, analysis in a larger sample is required before definite statements regarding this can be permitted. The neurological subscore of the FOS-MSSI does not seem to be the main driver behind this correlation, as sNfL Z-scores in PwFD with a neurological subscore of ≥ 1 and 0 show no significant difference (Table <xref rid=""Tab4"" ref-type=""table"">4</xref>). Importantly however, comparison of PwFD with and without ischemic white matter lesions on cerebral imaging (FOS-MSSI-cerebrovascular ≥ 3) yielded a significant difference in sNfL Z-scores (<italic toggle=""yes"">p</italic> = 0.03, Tables <xref rid=""Tab4"" ref-type=""table"">3</xref> and <xref rid=""Tab3"" ref-type=""table"">4</xref>; Fig. <xref rid=""Fig2"" ref-type=""fig"">2</xref>). This increase of sNfL with the presence of iWML is in line with increased sNfL in people with ischemic stroke<sup><xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR24"">24</xref></sup> and other diseases with involvement of the white matter and increased sNfL<sup><xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR18"">18</xref></sup>. To further corroborate this finding, the difference of sNfL Z-scores in PwFD without iWML lesions and healthy controls was not significant (<italic toggle=""yes"">p</italic> = 0.34). While requiring confirmation and further characterization, this association of increased sNfL and white matter lesions might help in routine patient care to monitor CNS integrity, without requiring a costly annual MRI. Although large fiber peripheral neuropathy has been linked to an elevation in sNfL<sup><xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR25"">25</xref>,<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR26"">26</xref></sup>, damage to small nerve fibers does not appear to cause an increase in sNfL<sup><xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR27"">27</xref></sup>. Accordingly, we found no difference in sNfL-concentration in PwFD with respect to acroparesthesia, which is thought to be partly due to a small fiber neuropathy<sup><xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR28"">28</xref>,<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR29"">29</xref></sup>. The significance of the difference of sNfL absolute values in PwFD receiving any disease-specific therapy compared to treatment naïve PwFD (<italic toggle=""yes"">p</italic> = 0.015) failed significance when analyzing Z-scores (<italic toggle=""yes"">p</italic> = 0.094). Indeed, the absence of disease-specific therapy most likely reflects mild disease-severity without relevant organ damage evident through a significantly lower FOS-MSSI, as well as younger age. On the other hand, improvement of increased sNfL with disease specific therapy seems equally plausible; and while we could not show any meaningful correlation of sNfL Z-scores with duration of therapy in analysis of a single timepoint, assessment of longitudinal change in sNfL will be required to clarify the association with disease specific therapy. Interestingly, we found a fair correlation between sNfL Z-scores and serum creatinine and eGFR. A correlation of the concentration of NfL in blood (serum or plasma) with creatinine and eGFR has indeed been described in previous studies<sup><xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR30"">30</xref>–<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR32"">32</xref></sup>, maybe hinting at another, yet unknown mechanism by which an increase in blood-NfL is associated with a reduction in renal function, which – after all – has not been directly linked to neuro-axonal injury. Although the elimination of sNfL in humans has not been understood in detail, urinary excretion seems unlikely, as NfL, is hardly detectable in urine<sup><xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR33"">33</xref></sup> and does not appear elevated in patients with end-stage renal disease (eGFR < 10 mL/min/1.73 m²) requiring hemodialysis, who showed maximum sNfL-concentration below 20 pg/mL<sup><xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR34"">34</xref></sup>. The considerable size of NfL with 68 kDa would also argue against renal filtration<sup><xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR35"">35</xref></sup>. One possible route of degradation could lie in uptake by macrophages and/or the reticuloendothelial system and subsequent intracellular metabolism, similar to the proposed clearance of e.g. von Willebrand factor<sup><xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR36"">36</xref></sup>. Hampered intracellular degradation with impaired lysosomal metabolism in a lysosomal storage disorder, however, could be envisaged to cause rising sNfL-levels over decades suffering from this disease. On the other hand, eGFR has been shown to be a prominent biomarker for FD predicting Fabry-associated clinical events and disease progression<sup><xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR37"">37</xref>,<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR38"">38</xref></sup>. A decrease in renal clearance might thus represent a general parameter of disease-severity. While the size of our cohort considering the rarity of FD and the good clinical phenotyping can be considered as strengths of our study, we must acknowledge several limitations. Any differences and extrapolations based on subgroups have to be verified in larger samples as small sample sizes can easily interfere with statistical testing. A single-timepoint analysis of a biomarker in FD could fall short of detecting meaningful changes over time, hence a more detailed investigation including longitudinal data is required to further evaluate the role of sNfL as a biomarker in FD.  Analysis of PwFD reveals increased sNfL Z-scores compared to healthy controls. Among PwFD, higher sNfL Z-scores were found in the presence of ischemic white matter lesions in the CNS. Interestingly, while sNfL Z-scores are associated with disease-severity, also impaired renal function measured with serum-creatinine and eGFR appears to be fairly correlated with sNfL. Since the elimination of NfL is still not fully understood, maybe impaired lysosomal metabolism is involved in its observed increase in addition to cerebrovascular injury. Befitting the X-linked inheritance with random X-inactivation in females responsible for phenotypic variability, sNfL levels were higher in males than in females. As sNfL is easily obtainable and shows a robust correlation with disease severity in FD (FOS-MSSI, iWML) it might be a suitable biomarker for CNS injury and general disease severity in PwFD, although further examination is still required.",N/A,3 10 2024
Unambiguous Interpretation of the Pathogenicity of the GLA c.547+3A>G Variant Causing Fabry Disease,"Objectives: This study aims to demonstrate the role of case-level American College of Medical Genetics (ACMG) criteria, such as familial segregation and pathology data, in providing conclusive evidence for the pathogenicity of ultrarare <italic toggle=""yes"">GLA</italic> variants causing Anderson–Fabry disease when gene-level and variant-level criteria provide ambiguous or discrepant results. Case/family description: A 52-year-old woman presented with new-onset shortness of breath, chest pain, and palpitations. Echocardiography revealed mild left ventricular wall thickening (14 mm) and mild diastolic dysfunction. She was the second of three siblings born to unrelated parents, both of whom died from malignancies. Family screening identified brothers, one affected 55-year-old with hypertension and asthma and one unaffected 47-year-old. The 15-year-old son of the proband complained of exercise-induced burning feet acral pain his electrocardiogram showed a short PR interval and signs of early hypertrophy. Results: Endomyocardial biopsies of the proband and the affected sibling demonstrated substrate accumulation (globotriaosylceramide). The anti-α-galactosidase-A immunostain showed a total loss of the enzyme in the hemizygous male and a mosaic pattern in the heterozygous female. The next-generation sequencing short-read multigene panel identified the c.547+3A>G variant in the <italic toggle=""yes"">GLA</italic> gene and excluded variants in other genes; Oxford-Nanopore long-read sequencing excluded known pathogenic deep intronic variants. A Multiplex-Ligation-dependent-Probe-Amplification assay excluded copy number variations. Based on the variant-level and gene-level ACMG criteria, the variant was classified as a Variant of Uncertain Significance or Likely Benign using different bioinformatic tools. By adding case-level functional data (endomyocardial biopsy, PS3_VeryStrong) and familial data (segregation of genotype with phenotype, PP2_Moderate), the variant was classified as Likely Pathogenic/Pathogenic. Conclusion: ACMG case-level data can unambiguously resolve uncertain interpretations of <italic toggle=""yes"">GLA</italic> variants.","Anderson–Fabry Disease (AFD) is a rare X-linked syndrome caused by pathogenic defects in the <italic toggle=""yes"">GLA</italic> gene encoding the enzyme α-galactosidase A (α-Gal A) (ICD-10: E75.2; ORPHA324; RCG080; MIM#301500) [<xref rid=""B1-genes-15-01212"" ref-type=""bibr"">1</xref>]. The resulting enzyme deficiency leads to intracellular accumulation of undigested globotriaosylceramide (GB3) with consequent organ/tissue damage. In classical AFD, the diagnosis can be suspected based on the multiorgan/system phenotypical traits and be supported by enzyme activity test in affected hemizygous males but not in heterozygous females in whom genetic testing is essential for the diagnosis because enzyme activity levels are not informative [<xref rid=""B2-genes-15-01212"" ref-type=""bibr"">2</xref>,<xref rid=""B3-genes-15-01212"" ref-type=""bibr"">3</xref>]. In non-classical, late-onset AFD, clinical manifestations may involve a single organ, typically the heart. Alternatively, the diagnosis of AFD can result from screening studies (α-Gal A enzyme activity or genetic testing) in patients with the following “at-risk” phenotypes [<xref rid=""B4-genes-15-01212"" ref-type=""bibr"">4</xref>,<xref rid=""B5-genes-15-01212"" ref-type=""bibr"">5</xref>,<xref rid=""B6-genes-15-01212"" ref-type=""bibr"">6</xref>]: cardiac (hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, HCM) [<xref rid=""B7-genes-15-01212"" ref-type=""bibr"">7</xref>], nervous, either central (cryptogenic stroke) or peripheral (peripheral neuropathy) [<xref rid=""B8-genes-15-01212"" ref-type=""bibr"">8</xref>], renal (albuminuria, proteinuria, renal failure) [<xref rid=""B9-genes-15-01212"" ref-type=""bibr"">9</xref>], dermatological (hypohidrosis, angiokeratomas) [<xref rid=""B10-genes-15-01212"" ref-type=""bibr"">10</xref>], ocular (non-iatrogenic cornea verticillata) [<xref rid=""B11-genes-15-01212"" ref-type=""bibr"">11</xref>,<xref rid=""B12-genes-15-01212"" ref-type=""bibr"">12</xref>], or gastroenterological [<xref rid=""B13-genes-15-01212"" ref-type=""bibr"">13</xref>,<xref rid=""B14-genes-15-01212"" ref-type=""bibr"">14</xref>]. In patients with late-onset cardiac variants (e.g., p.N215S, p.F113L), the heart is the main and nearly uniquely affected organ, mimicking HCM [<xref rid=""B4-genes-15-01212"" ref-type=""bibr"">4</xref>] and representing 0.94% males and 0.90% females in a consecutive series of patients clinically diagnosed with HCM [<xref rid=""B6-genes-15-01212"" ref-type=""bibr"">6</xref>]. The ACMG/AMP criteria-based interpretation of the pathogenicity of <italic toggle=""yes"">GLA</italic> variants [<xref rid=""B15-genes-15-01212"" ref-type=""bibr"">15</xref>] distinguishes clinically actionable Pathogenic/Likely Pathogenic (P/LP) variants from non-clinically actionable variants that include both Variants of Uncertain Significance (VUS) and Likely Benign/Benign variants (LB/B) [<xref rid=""B16-genes-15-01212"" ref-type=""bibr"">16</xref>]. The pathogenicity is calculated with a scale point system that results from the sum of fulfilled criteria weighted by their strength of evidence [<xref rid=""B17-genes-15-01212"" ref-type=""bibr"">17</xref>]. Variant interpretation software automatically analyzes variant-level and gene-level criteria (nine out of sixteen pathogenic and eight out of twelve benign criteria) based on gene features, variant types, impact prediction, prevalence in case series and control populations, and reputable literature, irrespective of clinical and genetic evaluations of the patients and families (a priori criteria). Vice versa, patient-level criteria require non-automated curation of phenotypical traits, clinical genetics, and functional data. When ultra-rare or novel variants (unreported in GnomAD, ClinVar, etc.) are identified, the use of different software can provide discrepant interpretations of the same variants, either over- or under-estimating the class of pathogenicity. The addition of patient-level criteria, in particular with Strong or Very Strong strength, may equalize different interpretations. The PS3 criterion (Pathogenic with Strong strength) may add conclusive functional evidence of the deleterious impact of the variants based on in-vitro experiments or in-vivo tissue studies, in the absence of a second variant in the same gene and in known genes that can mimic similar pathophysiology [<xref rid=""B16-genes-15-01212"" ref-type=""bibr"">16</xref>]. On the contrary, the BS3 (Benign with Strong weight) criterion excludes the damaging effect of a gene variant. In AFD, the in vivo PS3 criterion is achievable by demonstrating the presence of intracellular accumulation and its specific composition using targeted light microscopy immunohistochemistry and immune-electron microscopy techniques [<xref rid=""B6-genes-15-01212"" ref-type=""bibr"">6</xref>,<xref rid=""B14-genes-15-01212"" ref-type=""bibr"">14</xref>,<xref rid=""B16-genes-15-01212"" ref-type=""bibr"">16</xref>]. We describe an ultrarare variant in the <italic toggle=""yes"">GLA</italic> gene identified with next-generation sequencing (NGS) multigene panel testing in a female proband with a clinical diagnosis of suspected mild “HCM”: the interpretation of the pathogenicity based on gene- and variant-level criteria activated by different software remained ambiguous. The female sex prevented the diagnostic contribution of enzymatic activity. The immunohistochemical study of the endomyocardial biopsy (EMB) added the PS3 criterion with a Very Strong level of evidence proving the pathogenicity of the <italic toggle=""yes"">GLA</italic> variant and the conclusive diagnosis of Fabry Disease.   Our cases demonstrate how tissue studies, in particular, myocardial tissue in the case of cardiac clinical manifestations, provide unambiguous evidence and precise diagnosis of AFD cardiomyopathy when the genetic test identifies ultrarare or novel gene variants classified as VUS using a priori ACMG pathogenicity criteria. Our proband is a 52-year-old woman without clinical indications for eventually performing an extracardiac biopsy who is a heterozygous carrier of a non-otherwise classifiable VUS in the <italic toggle=""yes"">GLA</italic> gene. Her EMB findings validated the pathogenicity and disease mechanism of the c.547+3A>G <italic toggle=""yes"">GLA</italic> variant recently predicted with a minigene splicing assay to cause the partial deletion of the adjacent exon and to introduce the p.Gly163Leufs*2 protein defect [<xref rid=""B20-genes-15-01212"" ref-type=""bibr"">20</xref>]. All investigated pathophysiologic pathways linking the <italic toggle=""yes"">GLA</italic> gene variant to the clinical and pathological phenotype concordantly supported the diagnosis of AFD, as elegantly discussed by Oliveira JP et al. [<xref rid=""B21-genes-15-01212"" ref-type=""bibr"">21</xref>]. The precise diagnosis and correct classification of gene variants provide the discriminating key for clinically actionable (LP/P) and non-actionable (VUS, LB/B) gene variants [<xref rid=""B16-genes-15-01212"" ref-type=""bibr"">16</xref>]. In the last decade, the expansion of population databases, the numerous clinical studies with longitudinal monitoring of families, the increase in knowledge addressing the functional effect of variants in the <italic toggle=""yes"">GLA</italic> gene, and, in our experience, in vivo tissue studies, either EMB or extracardiac biopsies [<xref rid=""B6-genes-15-01212"" ref-type=""bibr"">6</xref>,<xref rid=""B14-genes-15-01212"" ref-type=""bibr"">14</xref>], have contributed to the re-classification of numerous gene variants originally interpreted as disease-causing but subsequently recognized as either VUS or LB/B [<xref rid=""B20-genes-15-01212"" ref-type=""bibr"">20</xref>]. Clinical actionability of gene variants is essential for treatment decisions. Although the diagnosis of AFD can be obtained with certainty with enzymatic tests in the male patient and in vivo evidence of GB3 accumulation, the genetic test is essential both for family screenings and for therapeutic options, in particular for variant-dependent, chaperone-based therapeutic decisions which in our family cannot be offered because the variant is not amenable to this treatment [<xref rid=""B22-genes-15-01212"" ref-type=""bibr"">22</xref>]. Therefore, when the proband of the family is a heterozygous female, the carrier of a novel or ultrarare or ambiguous <italic toggle=""yes"">GLA</italic> variant, and with non-informative enzyme activity assay, the precise diagnosis is achieved when clinical traits and actionable variants in the <italic toggle=""yes"">GLA</italic> gene are associated with the evidence of substrate accumulation, concordantly demonstrating the unequivocal interpretation of the variant pathogenicity. Additional in vitro tests exploring the effects of non-canonical splice variants may further contribute to the certainty of clinical actionability [<xref rid=""B20-genes-15-01212"" ref-type=""bibr"">20</xref>]. The <italic toggle=""yes"">GLA</italic> gene databases include hundreds of pathogenic variants associated with classical AFD and late-onset cardiac variants [<xref rid=""B23-genes-15-01212"" ref-type=""bibr"">23</xref>]. For numerous validated variants, the genetic test in patients and families with phenotypes consistent with the disease, the measurement of enzyme activity in males, and circulating LysoGB3 may be sufficient for diagnosis and monitoring [<xref rid=""B4-genes-15-01212"" ref-type=""bibr"">4</xref>]. However, many variants are unique and described in non-replicated case reports. The demonstration of intracellular accumulations of GB3 remains a key to the pathogenicity of new or ultrarare ambiguous <italic toggle=""yes"">GLA</italic> variants. In these cases, the addition of the ACMG PS3 criterion to the a priori criteria based on computational algorithms, prediction tools, and databases provides certain diagnoses, resolving the uncertainty of the variant interpretation. The ClinVar database (2024) currently includes 1041 <italic toggle=""yes"">GLA</italic> variants, of which: 26 (2.5%) are splice variants that affect canonical splice sites, and 141 are intronic variants (13.5%) potentially affecting splicing; a few of them are deep intronic variants, others affect non-canonical splice sites as for the herein reported variant [<xref rid=""B20-genes-15-01212"" ref-type=""bibr"">20</xref>]. Out of the overall intronic variants, 12 are classified as LP/P and 21 as VUS (<xref rid=""genes-15-01212-t001"" ref-type=""table"">Table 1</xref>). The c.547+3A>G variant is described as VUS but our data prove its pathogenicity. Overall, when a unique or ultra-rare ambiguous <italic toggle=""yes"">GLA</italic> variant is identified in the absence of other LP/P variants in the same gene and variant- and gene-level data are insufficient to resolve the uncertainty, a GB3-positive tissue biopsy can meet the PS3 pathogenic criterion, providing an unambiguous diagnosis of AFD.",N/A,17 9 2024
Establishing Treatment Effectiveness in Fabry Disease: Observation-Based Recommendations for Improvement,"Fabry disease (FD, OMIM #301500) is caused by pathogenic <italic toggle=""yes"">GLA</italic> gene (OMIM #300644) variants, resulting in a deficiency of the α-galactosidase A enzyme with accumulation of its substrate globotriaosylceramide and its derivatives. The phenotype of FD is highly variable, with distinctive disease features and course in classical male patients but more diverse and often nonspecific features in non-classical and female patients. FD-specific therapies have been available for approximately two decades, yet establishing robust evidence for long-term effectiveness remains challenging. This review aims to identify the factors contributing to this lack of robust evidence for the treatment of FD with enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) (agalsidase-alfa and -beta and pegunigalsidase alfa) and chaperone therapy (migalastat). Major factors that have been identified are study population heterogeneity (concerning sex, age, phenotype, disease stage) and differences in study design (control groups, outcomes assessed), as well as the short duration of studies. To address these challenges, we advocate for patient matching to improve control group compatibility in future FD therapy studies. We recommend international collaboration and harmonization, facilitated by an independent FD registry. We propose a stepwise approach for evaluating the effectiveness of novel treatments, including recommendations for surrogate outcomes and required study duration.","Fabry disease (FD) is a lysosomal storage disorder caused by pathogenic variants in the <italic toggle=""yes"">GLA</italic> gene with a very broad phenotypic spectrum. The classical phenotype of FD is well-defined with the onset of characteristic features, e.g., acroparesthesia, angiokeratoma, and cornea verticillata, in childhood or adolescence [<xref rid=""B1-ijms-25-09752"" ref-type=""bibr"">1</xref>]. With advancing age, progressive organ involvement becomes evident through the presence of albuminuria and gradually deteriorating renal function, morphological and functional changes in the heart, and the development of cerebrovascular incidents [<xref rid=""B2-ijms-25-09752"" ref-type=""bibr"">2</xref>]. Notably, this full classical FD phenotype is almost exclusively observed in male FD patients with <italic toggle=""yes"">GLA</italic> variants, resulting in (near) complete loss of α-galactosidase A (AGAL) enzyme activity. Clinical presentation in other FD patients is far more variable and may lack the disease-specific features. In females with <italic toggle=""yes"">GLA</italic> variants associated with classical FD in males, the clinical picture is likely influenced by genetic mosaicism on the tissue level [<xref rid=""B3-ijms-25-09752"" ref-type=""bibr"">3</xref>]. These female patients often develop cardiomyopathy, with an average onset of clinical symptoms after age 40 years, but generally much later, often in the absence of other clinically significant organ involvement. Renal function remains within the normal population range in the majority of female patients [<xref rid=""B4-ijms-25-09752"" ref-type=""bibr"">4</xref>], and the development of renal failure with FD as a single cause is rare [<xref rid=""B5-ijms-25-09752"" ref-type=""bibr"">5</xref>]. They may be at higher risk for the development of white matter lesions in the brain, transient ischemic attack (TIA), and stroke, though the relative contribution of the <italic toggle=""yes"">GLA</italic> variant and general risk factors (e.g., smoking, diabetes) remains to be determined [<xref rid=""B6-ijms-25-09752"" ref-type=""bibr"">6</xref>]. A similar clinical presentation is observed in male FD patients with variants that have less deleterious effects on enzyme activity. These variants are often referred to as causing late-onset, atypical, or non-classical FD. Women carrying these ‘late-onset’ variants do not develop FD symptoms and may have a normal life expectancy, free from FD-related events [<xref rid=""B7-ijms-25-09752"" ref-type=""bibr"">7</xref>]. This means that for the evaluation of therapeutic effectiveness, these patient groups should be analyzed separately. Importantly, there are also <italic toggle=""yes"">GLA</italic> variants that result in reduced AGAL enzyme activity but do not lead to FD: the residual enzyme activity is apparently sufficient to prevent substrate accumulation, which is the driver of major lysosomal dysfunction in FD [<xref rid=""B8-ijms-25-09752"" ref-type=""bibr"">8</xref>]. The level of residual enzyme activity required to prevent substrate accumulation may differ between tissues, and the 4-methylumbelliferone (4-MU) assay generally used to determine residual enzyme activity in leucocytes lacks accuracy at very low enzyme activity levels. Therefore, with the current methods, there is no straightforward relationship between measured residual AGAL activity and disease severity [<xref rid=""B9-ijms-25-09752"" ref-type=""bibr"">9</xref>]. What remains unclear at this time is whether carrying a ‘mild’ <italic toggle=""yes"">GLA</italic> variant, not resulting in abundant substrate accumulation, may contribute to the overall risk of multifactorial conditions such as coronary artery disease and cerebrovascular disease, rather than causing a classic Mendelian effect [<xref rid=""B10-ijms-25-09752"" ref-type=""bibr"">10</xref>,<xref rid=""B11-ijms-25-09752"" ref-type=""bibr"">11</xref>,<xref rid=""B12-ijms-25-09752"" ref-type=""bibr"">12</xref>]. If this is the case, two situations can be identified, as follows: (1) a monogenetic disorder named FD caused by ‘severe’ <italic toggle=""yes"">GLA</italic> variants and (2) <italic toggle=""yes"">GLA</italic> variants that may be considered cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factors, impacting health only in the presence of other CVD risk factors [<xref rid=""B8-ijms-25-09752"" ref-type=""bibr"">8</xref>,<xref rid=""B9-ijms-25-09752"" ref-type=""bibr"">9</xref>]. The consequence would be that only in the first situation FD-specific therapy should be considered (as well as treating other CVD risk factors). In the second instance, if the <italic toggle=""yes"">GLA</italic> variant is a potential additional CVD risk factor with an uncertain weight of the contribution to the overall risk, it may be more prudent to treat the well-known CVD risk factors, such as smoking, hypertension, and dyslipidemia, taking into account the costs and burden of treatment with FD-specific therapy. FD-specific therapy, as approved by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) and the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), is available in the form of recombinant enzyme replacement therapy (ERT; agalsidase alfa (Replagal), agalsidase beta (Fabrazyme)), chaperone therapy (migalastat (Galafold)), and second-generation ERT (pegunigalsidase alfa (Elfabrio)). Biosimilars may be available locally. Alternative treatment modalities are currently being investigated, including novel small-molecule chaperones, gene and mRNA therapy, and substrate reduction therapy [<xref rid=""B13-ijms-25-09752"" ref-type=""bibr"">13</xref>]. Despite FD-specific therapy being available for over two decades, establishing robust long-term treatment effects remains challenging, and publications give mixed messages [<xref rid=""B14-ijms-25-09752"" ref-type=""bibr"">14</xref>,<xref rid=""B15-ijms-25-09752"" ref-type=""bibr"">15</xref>,<xref rid=""B16-ijms-25-09752"" ref-type=""bibr"">16</xref>]. The aim of this review is to identify the factors that interfere with reaching firm conclusions regarding treatment effectiveness in FD. In the second part, recommendations will be given to address these issues, which can help clinician scientists, drug developers, and regulators in designing future studies and outcome analyses of current treatments. We start by providing a brief overview of the characteristics of currently available FD-specific therapies. Next, we identify the factors that limit treatment effectiveness evaluation in published studies. For data on the effectiveness of ERT, we evaluated all available meta-analyses given the fact that the older studies have smaller sample sizes and durations, and discussing the individual studies would not add much to already published reviews. Since we expect outcome analyses to have benefited from growing insights in FD, for publications on ERT effectiveness in the past five years (2018–2023) we evaluated single studies with primary data. For the newer FD-specific therapies, such as migalastat and pegunigalsidase alfa, we assess phase 3 studies, comparing treatment effects to placebo or the untreated state. Note that his review exclusively focuses on currently approved FD therapies and does not address unauthorized therapies, in vitro research, or animal studies.  Since the introduction of ERT as the first FD-specific therapy, numerous reviews have been published regarding its impact on a variety of disease symptoms and manifestations. To quantify the actual effect of a therapy, the most robust evidence is obtained through meta-analyses that analyze and compare disease outcomes between treated and untreated patients. For this reason, we reviewed all meta-analyses that have investigated ERT effects in FD (see <xref rid=""app1-ijms-25-09752"" ref-type=""app"">Appendix A</xref> for search strategy). Our examination encompassed the outcome measures, the estimated treatment effects, and the challenges encountered during these analyses. We focused specifically on clinical outcomes (e.g., renal insufficiency), composite outcomes (e.g., cardiac events), and surrogate outcomes (e.g., left ventricular mass index), but excluded biomarker outcomes (e.g., change in Gb3 inclusions in tissue biopsies). This was done because there is substantial and consistent evidence for the ability of the treatments to change biomarker levels (recently reviewed in Burlina et al.) [<xref rid=""B19-ijms-25-09752"" ref-type=""bibr"">19</xref>], while uncertainty exists regarding the effect on clinical outcomes. We will, however, in the discussion part of this review address the potential role of assessing changes in biomarkers. Since FD-specific therapy became available more than 20 years ago, our understanding of complications development in FD has significantly improved. In addition to sex and <italic toggle=""yes"">GLA</italic> variant, the disease stage at the time of therapy initiation, which is in part determined by the patient’s age, is an important determinant of treatment outcomes [<xref rid=""B25-ijms-25-09752"" ref-type=""bibr"">25</xref>]. Untreated plasma lysoGb3 levels are a relevant biomarker reflecting individual patients’ predicted disease development at the time of diagnosis [<xref rid=""B4-ijms-25-09752"" ref-type=""bibr"">4</xref>]. Studies performed in the past decade have provided insight into the rate of development of FD manifestations and complications [<xref rid=""B7-ijms-25-09752"" ref-type=""bibr"">7</xref>,<xref rid=""B26-ijms-25-09752"" ref-type=""bibr"">26</xref>,<xref rid=""B27-ijms-25-09752"" ref-type=""bibr"">27</xref>,<xref rid=""B28-ijms-25-09752"" ref-type=""bibr"">28</xref>], providing insight into the study durations needed to capture specific treatment effects. We analyzed whether these insights have been implemented in more recent FD treatment studies. To this end, we searched PubMed for ERT effectiveness studies published in the last 5 years (2018–2023) (see <xref rid=""app2-ijms-25-09752"" ref-type=""app"">Appendix B</xref> for search strategy). Studies were considered eligible if they reported primary data on treated patients (excluding literature cohorts or reviews) and compared outcomes with a distinct group of untreated patients (excluding cross-over studies). Case reports and series were excluded. In total, we identified four studies that reported primary data on the effects of ERT, two studies on migalastat, and one study on pegunigalsidase alfa fitting the inclusion criteria. Open-label extension studies or switch-over trials were not included in this review because of the absence of a control group. Based on the meta-analyses and recent studies, establishing definitive conclusions about the effectiveness of FD-specific therapies across different patient subgroups remains challenging due to the lack of robust evidence on hard clinical endpoints. In classical male FD patients, ERT (with the most evidence available for agalsidase beta) has a beneficial effect in ameliorating renal complications. In these patients, progression is significantly reduced if ERT is started early in the disease course. The evidence for the impact on cardiac complications is less robust. Though treatment with ERT (again, most evidence available for agalsidase beta) has been shown to reduce the increased LVM in short-term studies, it is unclear to what extent this positively impacts long-term cardiac function and prevents the occurrence of arrythmias. For pegunigalsidase alfa, limited available evidence suggests a similar effect of pegunigalsidase alfa compared to agalsidase beta on renal function. The effect of this treatment on other disease manifestations has not been fully assessed yet. For male and female FD patients with lower untreated plasma lysoGb3 levels compared to male patients with classical FD, robust evidence for a positive impact of ERT on disease progression and development of long-term complications is lacking. The greatest contributing factors to the lack of certainty are the heterogeneity of the disease and the lack of treatment effectiveness analyses correcting for known prognostic variables. The same is true for migalastat, where almost all patients belong to the category with large disease heterogeneity, given the fact that the therapy can only be applied in patients with specific <italic toggle=""yes"">GLA</italic> variants, most of which are associated with residual enzyme activity. In this disease group, cardiac manifestations and complications are most prominent, and there is a need for establishing well-defined endpoints with a known relation to clinical outcomes.

Myocardial Fibrosis Quantification Methods by Cardiovascular Magnetic Resonance Imaging in Patients with Fabry Disease,"<bold>Background/Objectives</bold>: The presence of late gadolinium enhancement (LGE) on cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) in patients with Fabry disease (FD) is a predictor of adverse cardiac events. The aim of this study was to establish the most reliable and reproducible technique for quantifying LGE in patients with FD. <bold>Methods</bold>: Twenty FD patients with LGE who underwent CMR on the same scanner and LGE sequence were included. LGE quantifications were done using gray-scale thresholds of 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6 standard deviations (SD) above the mean signal intensity of the remote myocardium, the full width at half maximum method (FWHM), visual assessment with threshold (VAT) and the fully manual method (MM). <bold>Results</bold>: The mean amount of fibrosis varied between quantification techniques from 36 ± 19 at 2SD to 2 ± 2 g using the FWHM (<italic toggle=""yes"">p</italic> < 0.0001). Intraobserver reliability was excellent for most methods, except for the FWHM which was good (ICC 0.84; all <italic toggle=""yes"">p</italic> < 0.05). Interobserver reliability was excellent for VAT (ICC 0.94) and good for other techniques (all <italic toggle=""yes"">p</italic> < 0.05). Intraobserver reproducibility showed the lowest coefficient of variation (CV, 6%) at 5SD and at 2SD and VAT (35% and 38%) for interobserver reproducibility. The FWHM revealed the highest CV (63% and 94%) for both intra- and interobserver reproducibility. <bold>Conclusions</bold>: The available methods for LGE quantification demonstrate good to excellent intra- and interobserver reproducibility in patients with FD. The most reliable and reproducible techniques were VAT and 5SD, whereas the FWHM was the least reliable in the setting of our study. The total amount of LGE varies strongly with the quantification technique used.","Myocardial fibrosis, defined as the presence of late gadolinium enhancement (LGE) in cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) studies, has been shown to be a valuable marker of unfavorable prognosis in many cardiac diseases, including hypertrophic cardiomyopathy [<xref rid=""B1-jcm-13-05047"" ref-type=""bibr"">1</xref>,<xref rid=""B2-jcm-13-05047"" ref-type=""bibr"">2</xref>,<xref rid=""B3-jcm-13-05047"" ref-type=""bibr"">3</xref>,<xref rid=""B4-jcm-13-05047"" ref-type=""bibr"">4</xref>,<xref rid=""B5-jcm-13-05047"" ref-type=""bibr"">5</xref>], aortic stenosis [<xref rid=""B6-jcm-13-05047"" ref-type=""bibr"">6</xref>,<xref rid=""B7-jcm-13-05047"" ref-type=""bibr"">7</xref>,<xref rid=""B8-jcm-13-05047"" ref-type=""bibr"">8</xref>], and dilated cardiomyopathy [<xref rid=""B9-jcm-13-05047"" ref-type=""bibr"">9</xref>]. Similarly, LGE was found to be a predictor of adverse cardiac events in patients with Fabry disease (FD) [<xref rid=""B10-jcm-13-05047"" ref-type=""bibr"">10</xref>,<xref rid=""B11-jcm-13-05047"" ref-type=""bibr"">11</xref>,<xref rid=""B12-jcm-13-05047"" ref-type=""bibr"">12</xref>], i.e., ventricular arrhythmias, likely induced by a fibrosis substrate. Both qualitative and quantitative assessments of LGE are important for cardiovascular risk stratification; however, diagnostic algorithms addressing this issue have not yet been standardized [<xref rid=""B13-jcm-13-05047"" ref-type=""bibr"">13</xref>].  There are several different quantification techniques available on commercial imaging platforms that are used in daily clinical practice to assess the amount of LGE [<xref rid=""B14-jcm-13-05047"" ref-type=""bibr"">14</xref>,<xref rid=""B15-jcm-13-05047"" ref-type=""bibr"">15</xref>]. Nonetheless, there is currently no consensus on which technique is most accurate and should be recommended for specific patient populations [<xref rid=""B1-jcm-13-05047"" ref-type=""bibr"">1</xref>]. Given the considerable variation of measurements, related to the quantification method used, it is commonly believed that the amount of LGE should be interpreted and/or compared using only the same quantification approach. Importantly, the characteristics and structure of myocardial fibrosis have been shown to vary with the underlying disease [<xref rid=""B16-jcm-13-05047"" ref-type=""bibr"">16</xref>], which may suggest that there is no single gold standard approach for assessing the amount of LGE on CMR [<xref rid=""B17-jcm-13-05047"" ref-type=""bibr"">17</xref>,<xref rid=""B18-jcm-13-05047"" ref-type=""bibr"">18</xref>]. Therefore, LGE quantification approaches should be verified and tested in etiologically homogenous patient populations to ensure that the LGE quantification thresholds are reliably defined and correlated with prognosis. The aim of this study was to establish the most reliable and reproducible technique for quantifying LGE in patients with FD.    This study demonstrated that the available methods for LGE quantification have good to excellent intra- and interobserver reliability in patients with FD; however, the total amount of LGE varies with the technique used. The best available techniques in the setting of our study (1.5 T MR scanner, a two-dimensional LGE technique) were VAT and 5SD, which had the highest intra- and interobserver ICCs. The FWMH method seems to be inferior to the other techniques because it has the highest CV and the lowest ICC. In FD, a rare inborn X-linked metabolic disorder, a diminished amount or lack of the enzyme alfa-galactosidase A causes the systemic accumulation of glycosphingolipids. Cardiac involvement may include LV hypertrophy, myocardial inflammation, myocardial fibrosis, heart failure and arrhythmias [<xref rid=""B20-jcm-13-05047"" ref-type=""bibr"">20</xref>,<xref rid=""B21-jcm-13-05047"" ref-type=""bibr"">21</xref>]. It has been shown that the maximum benefit of disease-specific therapies is gained by patients who have not yet developed Fabry cardiomyopathy, and with current treatment a limited effect is observed, particularly in patients with the late-onset cardiac variant of FD [<xref rid=""B21-jcm-13-05047"" ref-type=""bibr"">21</xref>]. Therefore, cardiovascular imaging is crucial for monitoring FD progression and the effects of treatment, with echocardiography and/or CMR repeated every 1–5 years depending on the presence and degree of cardiac abnormalities [<xref rid=""B20-jcm-13-05047"" ref-type=""bibr"">20</xref>,<xref rid=""B22-jcm-13-05047"" ref-type=""bibr"">22</xref>].  An important part of the CMR examination is myocardial tissue characterization by LGE [<xref rid=""B23-jcm-13-05047"" ref-type=""bibr"">23</xref>]. In our cohort, LGE was found in 37% of patients with FD, which is consistent with previous data [<xref rid=""B10-jcm-13-05047"" ref-type=""bibr"">10</xref>]. Histopathological studies have demonstrated that LGE on CMR is associated with focal myocardial collagen scarring [<xref rid=""B24-jcm-13-05047"" ref-type=""bibr"">24</xref>], the most common of which is located in the inferolateral wall. Myocardial fibrosis in FD usually has a nonischemic pattern, and its patchy and diffuse character makes the precise quantification of LGE challenging [<xref rid=""B24-jcm-13-05047"" ref-type=""bibr"">24</xref>,<xref rid=""B25-jcm-13-05047"" ref-type=""bibr"">25</xref>]. The role of LGE quantification in patients with FD has been intensively studied in recent years [<xref rid=""B10-jcm-13-05047"" ref-type=""bibr"">10</xref>,<xref rid=""B20-jcm-13-05047"" ref-type=""bibr"">20</xref>]. It has been shown that not only the total mass/volume of LGE, but also the changes in LGE amount over time in patients with FD have prognostic significance, independently determining the arrhythmic, HF and mortality outcomes [<xref rid=""B10-jcm-13-05047"" ref-type=""bibr"">10</xref>,<xref rid=""B20-jcm-13-05047"" ref-type=""bibr"">20</xref>]. In our last study on the impact of clinical characteristics and CMR findings on cardiac outcome in patients with FD, we found that both LV hypertrophy and presence of the LGE detected by CMR were associated with adverse cardiac events [<xref rid=""B12-jcm-13-05047"" ref-type=""bibr"">12</xref>]. In this study, patients were followed up for a median time of 4.9 years. The primary endpoint was composed of cardiac death, new occurrence of atrial fibrillation, heart failure, ventricular tachycardia and bradycardia requiring device implantation. In further quantitative analysis, the amount of LGE was quantified using 6 SD above the mean signal intensity for the normal nulled cardiac muscle and was further analyzed as a percentage of LGE to total LV myocardium. The univariate analysis revealed that the global amount of LGE was associated with an increased risk for the primary endpoint (HR 1.4 per 10% increase in LGE) [<xref rid=""B12-jcm-13-05047"" ref-type=""bibr"">12</xref>]. This finding supports the need to establish a reliable standard method for LGE quantification in daily clinical practice, as patients with FD usually require serial CMR studies and close follow-up of changes in the total amount of LGE.  Data assessing the utility of different approaches for LGE quantification in FD are scarce and, to the best of our knowledge, the present study is the first attempt to address this issue in this disease condition. LGE quantification methods have been more extensively studied for other pathologies, such as hypertrophic cardiomyopathy [<xref rid=""B15-jcm-13-05047"" ref-type=""bibr"">15</xref>,<xref rid=""B17-jcm-13-05047"" ref-type=""bibr"">17</xref>,<xref rid=""B26-jcm-13-05047"" ref-type=""bibr"">26</xref>,<xref rid=""B27-jcm-13-05047"" ref-type=""bibr"">27</xref>]. The common finding is that both in FD and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy the FWHM technique underestimates the total amount of LGE. This observation, together with the fact that the reproducibility of measurements obtained by this technique was inferior to that of other LGE assessment methods, prompted us to postulate that the FWHM may be the least adequate approach for LGE quantification in FD in daily clinical practice. Our findings need to be validated in other FD cohorts; however, existing evidence indicates that there is no single “ideal” technique for LGE quantification and that the available methods cannot be used interchangeably. Therefore, it seems extremely important to report which method was used for myocardial fibrosis quantification in an individual patient with FD and to use the same method for serial LGE assessment. All LGE quantification methods studied are characterized by good to excellent intra- and interobserver reliability in patients with FD. The best available techniques in the setting of our study were VAT and 5SD due to their intra- and interobserver reliability being the highest and they might be preferred for LGE quantification in patients with FD. In contrast, compared with other available techniques, the FWHM technique yields the least reproducible results and therefore should be avoided for LGE quantification in FD. The total amount of LGE differed among the LGE quantification methods studied. Hence, in clinical practice, it is crucial to report which technique of LGE quantification was used and the equal approach should be used for follow-up imaging. ",N/A,26 8 2024

The majority of those 657 (∼ 70%) were missense or nonsense mutations. According to previous research, the main pathogenic mechanism underlying FD was the deficiency of α-Gal A, which led to the progressive accumulation of glycolipids, primarily globotriaosylceramide (GL-3) and globotriaosylsphingosine (lyso-Gb3), in plasma of many cell types, including endothelium and cardiomyocytes.<xref rid=""hcae038-B14"" ref-type=""bibr""><sup>14</sup></xref>  <italic toggle=""yes"">GLA</italic> mutations leading to a complete loss of function result in the classical phenotype, with negligible or very low residual enzyme activity.<xref rid=""hcae038-B15"" ref-type=""bibr""><sup>15</sup></xref> As one of the rare diseases, FD is characterized by low prevalence, a lack of clinical samples, difficulties creating cohorts, difficulties running clinical trials and traditional screening.

In this study, we discovered a novel mutation (c.72 G > A; p. Trp24*) in the <italic toggle=""yes"">GLA</italic> gene from a Chinese family diagnosed with FD. The boy and his mother both suffered from multi-symptoms of FD, with deficiency of α-Gal A activity and accumulation of Lyso-Gb-3. The cardiac ultrasound and ECG of the boy and his mother both indicated cardiovascular involvement. Furthermore, his mother has already progressed to kidney damage and vestibular disease, as evidenced by microalbuminuria of 230 mg/24 h urine protein (ref. < 150 mg/24 h urine protein) and sensorineural deafness. It is apparent that early diagnosis and effective treatment are critical for the boy, to prevent or slow his progress like his mother. Fortunately, the boy received ERT in our department and achieved partial remission. According to the bioinformatic analysis, we observed that the mutation occurred in the N-terminal region, leading to a truncation of the protein and leaving only 24 amino acids. This truncation severely affects the function of the protein and destroys its enzyme activity. Interestingly, the development of iPSCs has permitted the genesis and study of rare diseases in culture dishes. iPSCs carry the patients’ individual genetic information and can undoubtedly serve as a potential and distinct disease model for elucidating molecular mechanisms as well as a high-throughput screening system for screening viable medicines.<xref rid=""hcae038-B28"" ref-type=""bibr""><sup>28</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid=""hcae038-B29"" ref-type=""bibr""><sup>29</sup></xref> Therefore, we generated patient-specific iPSC lines (iPS-FD) from patient’s PBMCs.

Inflammatory cytokine expression in Fabry disease: impact of disease phenotype and alterations under enzyme replacement therapy,,"Fabry disease (FD; OMIM#301500) is a rare X-linked inherited lysosomal storage disease that is caused by mutations in the <italic toggle=""yes"">GLA</italic> gene (NC_000023.11), which encodes the alpha-galactosidase A protein (α-Gal A) and is located on chromosome Xq22.1 (<xref rid=""B1"" ref-type=""bibr"">1</xref>). <italic toggle=""yes"">GLA</italic> mutations lead to a deficiency of lysosomal hydrolase α-Gal A (EC 3.2.1.22) activity (<xref rid=""B2"" ref-type=""bibr"">2</xref>, <xref rid=""B3"" ref-type=""bibr"">3</xref>) and the secondary lysosomal accumulation of globotriaosylceramide (Gb3) and other glycosphingolipids within cells. The progressive accumulation of these compounds causes cellular dysfunction, which subsequently damages multiple organs (<xref rid=""B4"" ref-type=""bibr"">4</xref>, <xref rid=""B5"" ref-type=""bibr"">5</xref>). Plasma globotriaosylsphingosine (Lyso-Gb3) is a deacylated metabolite of Gb3 that correlates well with FD phenotype, with a higher sensitivity than Gb3 (<xref rid=""B6"" ref-type=""bibr"">6</xref>). Plasma Lyso-Gb3 is currently a biomarker for the diagnosis and therapeutic efficacy monitoring of FD. FD can be classified into severe (classic FD) and milder (non-classic or late-onset FD) phenotypes. Classic FD has an earlier onset; it presents as a multisystemic disorder with manifestations such as neuropathic pain, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, renal insufficiency, and stroke. Non-classic FD is characterized by a more variable phenotype in which manifestations are predominantly limited to heart or kidney dysfunction (<xref rid=""B7"" ref-type=""bibr"">7</xref>–<xref rid=""B9"" ref-type=""bibr"">9</xref>). Enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) is the classic therapy for FD; it has been used for almost 20 years. ERT can effectively reduce Gb3 deposits in the urine, plasma, and tissues (<xref rid=""B10"" ref-type=""bibr"">10</xref>–<xref rid=""B12"" ref-type=""bibr"">12</xref>); delay multiple organ deterioration; and improve lifespan. Inflammatory activation plays an important role in FD pathogenesis. Glycolipids, especially Gb3, can bind to toll-like receptor 4 and trigger Notch1 signaling, which in turn activates the nuclear factor kappa B signaling cascade. This process results in the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines, leading to a chronic inflammatory state and associated vasculopathy (<xref rid=""B13"" ref-type=""bibr"">13</xref>). The long-lasting inflammation results in fibrosis, irreversible tissue injury, and ultimately, target organ failure (<xref rid=""B14"" ref-type=""bibr"">14</xref>, <xref rid=""B15"" ref-type=""bibr"">15</xref>). One study has also demonstrated that interleukin (IL)-1β promotes the expression of adhesion molecules, which enhances tissue infiltration and eventually results in tissue remodeling (<xref rid=""B16"" ref-type=""bibr"">16</xref>). Adult classic FD patients who receive ERT treatment display reduced antioxidant and increased pro-oxidant statuses and have higher levels of the pro-inflammatory cytokines tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α and IL-6 compared with HCs (<xref rid=""B17"" ref-type=""bibr"">17</xref>). These findings support the idea that oxidative stress and inflammatory activation act as major drivers of FD pathogenesis. To date, however, the potential clinical significance of inflammatory cytokine (IC) overexpression in FD remains inconclusive. In the current study, we therefore aimed to reveal the relationship between ICs and FD characteristics, such as severity and phenotype, as well as the impact of ERT on IC expression. Our findings will help to outline the inflammatory status and evaluate the inflammatory mechanisms of FD.   Evidence of inflammatory activation in FD has been reported in previous research. Uçeyler et al (<xref rid=""B32"" ref-type=""bibr"">32</xref>). reported that peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) from men with FD had higher baseline IL-1β gene expression compared to healthy men. De Francesco et al. (<xref rid=""B16"" ref-type=""bibr"">16</xref>) revealed that IL-1β and TNF-α were increased in unstimulated PBMC from 29 FD patients with acroparesthesia compared with HCs. And the supernatants of 24 h PBMC cultures had a significant increase in secreted IL-1β and IL-6. Dendritic cells and Monocytic population from Fabry patients’ PBMC showed a higher basal level of IL-1β compared to controls. Furthermore, a tendency toward a reduced percentage of invariant natural killer T cells producing IL-4 has been reported in naïve FD patients (<xref rid=""B33"" ref-type=""bibr"">33</xref>). Our results further indicate that diffuse inflammatory pathway activation occurs in FD, involving pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-1β, IL-5, IL-6, IL-8, IL-12, IL-17A, IL-17F, IL-22, TNF-α, TNF-β, and IFN-γ (produced by T cells and monocytes/macrophages) and anti-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-4 and IL-10 (produced by monocytes/macrophages) (<xref rid=""B34"" ref-type=""bibr"">34</xref>, <xref rid=""B35"" ref-type=""bibr"">35</xref>). Of these cytokines, some already been previously reported, such as IL-1β and TNF-α. De Francesco et al (<xref rid=""B16"" ref-type=""bibr"">16</xref>). finding suggests that excess amount Gb3 could in fact interact with TLR4, consequently triggering a signaling cascade that leads to produce IL-1β and TNF-α. ICs have a crucial role in the pathophysiology of FD-associated pain. Lyso-Gb3 deposition can reportedly impair calcium-activated potassium channel subunit alpha-1 activity and activate the Notch1 signaling pathway, thus inducing cutaneous nociceptor sensitization and pain attacks (<xref rid=""B36"" ref-type=""bibr"">36</xref>). In a cohort of 67 FD patients reported by Nurcan et al. (<xref rid=""B32"" ref-type=""bibr"">32</xref>), male FD patients with pain had higher TNF and IL-10 mRNA expression than those without pain, but had lower IL-4 mRNA expression. Moreover, classic male FD patients with pain had higher TNF mRNA expression than those without pain. In the present study, the presence of neuralgia or painful attacks in FD did not have a clear effect on IC expression. Even when patients were further divided by maximum pain intensity in the previous 24 hours, there were no changes in IC expression levels. This disparity in findings might be the result of differences in patient stratification methods and/or sample origins (<italic toggle=""yes"">in vitro</italic> peripheral blood mononuclear cells versus plasma). ICs may be a potential candidate biomarker reflecting disease burden and severity in FD. In one study of 36 classic FD patients, IL-6 and TNF-α levels were positively correlated with MSSI (<xref rid=""B37"" ref-type=""bibr"">37</xref>). In the present cohort, IFN-γ, IL-1β, IL-2, IL-4, IL-6, IL-8, IL-17F, and IL-22 all correlated with MSSI. Moreover, IL-8 was higher in the high MSSI group than in the low MSSI group. FD is characterized by proteinuria and progressive renal insufficiency (<xref rid=""B14"" ref-type=""bibr"">14</xref>). A previous study reported that 18 FD patients with renal dysfunction had higher levels of TNF, TNF receptor 1, and TNF receptor 2 (<xref rid=""B15"" ref-type=""bibr"">15</xref>). Cardiomyopathy with concentric hypertrophy and diastolic dysfunction is currently the most common cause of death in patients with FD (<xref rid=""B15"" ref-type=""bibr"">15</xref>), and histological myocarditis is detected in up to 56% of patients with cardiomyopathy (<xref rid=""B38"" ref-type=""bibr"">38</xref>). Chien et al. (<xref rid=""B39"" ref-type=""bibr"">39</xref>) reported that serum IL-18 is slightly increased in patients with left ventricular hypertrophy alone, and is even higher in FD patients with left ventricular hypertrophy carrying the IVS4 + 919 G>A mutation. Although it has already been described how inflammatory cytokines contribute to renal damage, and the cardiac fibrosis, there is currently rare conclusion on the statistical correlation analysis between ICs and these organ specific markers. The majority of the related studies in FD were binary classifications. Our study further reveals the correlation between IC and organ specific biomarkers for monitoring the disease. The expression of many ICs positively correlated with ACR, 24h-P, and eGFR, thus indicating the diffuse interaction of ICs with renal phenotypes. IFN-γ, IL-6, and IL-17F were positively correlated with LVMI, indicating that IC elevation may play a key role in the development of myocardial inflammatory damage and remodeling in FD. ERT can ameliorate the inflammatory status of FD; In a cohort of 30 FD patients who carried the IVS4 + 919 G>A mutation and developed left ventricular hypertrophy (<xref rid=""B39"" ref-type=""bibr"">39</xref>), IL-18 levels were decreased after ERT, and IL-18 was significantly increased in the cardiac biopsies of patients with poor ERT responses. It is generally accepted that Lyso-Gb3 is a good biomarker which is regular monitored during ERT. In van Breemen’s research (<xref rid=""B19"" ref-type=""bibr"">19</xref>), 43 Fabry patients presented with classical Fabry disease and received a minimum of 12 months of ERT. They observed ERT led to prominent reductions of plasma Lyso-Gb3 in Fabry males within 3 months, and stabilized after 6 months. Therefore, In the current study, we selected 6 months as the borderline to observe the trend of changes in ICs after ERT. TNF-β expression was restored after short-term (≤6 months) ERT, and the expression of IL-1β, IL-4, IL-6, and IL-10 was restored after long-term (>6 months) ERT (<xref rid=""f4"" ref-type=""fig"">
<bold>Figure 4</bold>
</xref>). Furthermore, IL-2 and IL-17A showed a downward trend with long-term treatment compared with HCs. Similarly, IL-2 and IL-17A restored to pre-treatment levels after long-term treatment compared with naïve patients. In the four individuals who underwent regular IC detection pre- and post-ERT, we observed many ICs show a trend of transient upward on 6 months ERT and then downward on 12 months ERT (<xref rid=""f5"" ref-type=""fig"">
<bold>Figure 5</bold>
</xref>), similar as shown in <xref rid=""f4"" ref-type=""fig"">
<bold>Figure 4</bold>
</xref>. Plasma lyso-Gb3 can activate podocyte Notch1 signaling pathway and upregulate IC expression (<xref rid=""B13"" ref-type=""bibr"">13</xref>). ERT, to a large extent, induced reversal of Fabry nephropathy-associated coordinated transcriptional alterations to levels comparable with normal controls over time. No significance was yielded when comparing the molecular states between patients treated with 10 and 5 years of ERT indicating that long term ERT helps to maintain good condition including innate immune system (<xref rid=""B40"" ref-type=""bibr"">40</xref>). Nevertheless, Neto et al. (<xref rid=""B37"" ref-type=""bibr"">37</xref>) reported higher serum IL-6 and TNF-α levels in patients treated with ERT than those not treated, which was similar as our result. We therefore speculate that the massive Gb3 released from cells into circulation on the initiation of ERT would lead to the transient upregulation of immune status. With the continued ERT and residual Gb3, the inflammatory response tends to stabilize. IC expression does not appear to be directly related to disease biomarkers; their relationships may thus be complex. In our cohort, there were no correlations between the expression of any ICs and α-Gal A. In a previous study of 76 patients, there were no correlations between α-Gal A and IL-10, IL-1β, IL-1α, or TNF-α (<xref rid=""B41"" ref-type=""bibr"">41</xref>), consistent with our results. We further explored the potential correlations between IC expression and Lyso-Gb3 in the present study, which revealed no significant findings. However, Biancini et al. (<xref rid=""B42"" ref-type=""bibr"">42</xref>) demonstrated that IL-6 and TNF-α were increased in patients. IL-6 was positively correlated with Gb3. Furthermore, Üçeyler et al. (<xref rid=""B32"" ref-type=""bibr"">32</xref>) reported that Lyso-Gb3 is markedly enhanced in peripheral blood mononuclear cells from FD patients after TNF-α treatment, thus suggesting that overactive inflammation may also accelerate Lyso-Gb3 deposits within cells. In the present study, there were few paired pre- and post-ERT samples. A larger sample size would enable the further exploration of the effects of ERT on IC expression—and of their correlation with clinical biomarkers and disease burden scores—in FD. Additionally, our study involved the expression of multiple ICs, which may interact in a complex network. The upstream mRNA regulation of these ICs might provide more detailed clues about inflammatory pathway activation in FD. In FD patients, the expression of ICs was widely upregulated. ERT helped to ameliorate inflammatory activation in FD. With the prolongation of ERT, some ICs restored, indicating the necessity of long-term ERT. Inflammatory status was positively correlated with disease burden and clinical markers in FD. By contrast, there were no significant correlations between inflammatory status and disease markers. Together, our findings indicate that the inflammatory pathway may be a promising therapeutic target for FD.",N/A,21 8 2024
Relationship between Capillaroscopic Architectural Patterns and Different Variant Subgroups in Fabry Disease: Analysis of Cases from a Multidisciplinary Center,"Anderson–Fabry disease (AFD) is a genetic lysosomal storage disorder caused by mutations in the α-galactosidase A gene, leading to impaired lysosomal function and resulting in both macrovascular and microvascular alterations. AFD patients often exhibit increased intima-media thickness (IMT) and reduced flow-mediated dilation (FMD), indicating non-atherosclerotic arterial thickening and the potential for cardiovascular events. Nailfold capillaroscopy, a non-invasive diagnostic tool, has shown potential in diagnosing and monitoring microcirculatory disorders in AFD, despite limited research. This study evaluates nailfold capillaroscopy findings in AFD patients, exploring correlations with GLA gene variant subgroups (associated with classical or late-onset phenotypes and variants of uncertain significance (VUSs)), and assessing morpho-functional differences between sexes. It aims to determine whether capillaroscopy can assist in the early identification of individuals with multiorgan vascular involvement. A retrospective observational study was conducted with 25 AFD patients from AOUP “G. Rodolico-San Marco” in Catania (2020–2023). Patients underwent genetic testing, enzyme activity evaluation, and nailfold capillaroscopy using Horus basic HS 200 videodermatoscopy. Parameters like angiotectonic disorder, vascular areas, capillary density, and intimal thickening were assessed. The study identified significant differences in capillaroscopy findings among patients with different GLA gene variant subgroups. Classic AFD variant patients showed reduced capillary length and signs of erythrocyte aggregation and dilated subpapillary plexus. No correlation was found between enzymatic activity and capillaroscopy parameters. However, Lyso-Gb3 levels were positively correlated with average capillary length (ῤ = 0.453; <italic toggle=""yes"">p</italic> = 0.059). Sex-specific differences in capillaroscopy findings were observed in neoangiogenesis and average capillary length, with distinct implications for men and women. This study highlights the potential of nailfold capillaroscopy in the diagnostic process and clinical management of AFD, particularly in relation to specific GLA gene mutations, as a valuable tool for the early diagnosis and monitoring of AFD.","  This study evaluated capillaroscopy findings in 25 AFD patients. Patients were divided into three subgroups based on the mutational variant of the GLA gene, which include classical- and late-onset-phenotype-associated variants, categorized into two subgroups, and the VUS subgroup (<xref rid=""genes-15-01101-f001"" ref-type=""fig"">Figure 1</xref> and <xref rid=""genes-15-01101-f002"" ref-type=""fig"">Figure 2</xref>). Demographic, laboratory characteristics, and morpho-functional alterations observed in capillaroscopy are shown in <xref rid=""genes-15-01101-t001"" ref-type=""table"">Table 1</xref>. Regarding demographics, age in the three groups (classic, late-onset, and VUS) was homogeneous and comparable; male prevalence showed no significant differences within subgroups. Statistically significant differences were observed in average Lyso-Gb3 levels; patients with the classic variant showed a statistically higher accumulation of Lyso-Gb3 compared to those with late-onset or VUSs, corresponding to reduced enzymatic activity in the classic variant group. Patients with the classic AFD variant had significantly reduced average capillary length, less than 20% tortuosity, erythrocyte aggregation presence, and dilated subpapillary plexus. Patients with late-onset variants had an invisible subpapillary plexus as a statistically significant variable in the hypothesis test and 20–50% tortuosity, also significant in VUS patients. These patients showed a significant absence of angiotectonic disorder compared to other subgroups. No significant differences were observed in other considered parameters like edema, giant capillaries, vascular and pseudovascular areas, acrosyndrome, microhemorrhages, and capillary heterogeneity. Neoangiogenesis was significantly less present in VUS patients (<italic toggle=""yes"">p</italic> = 0.029) (<xref rid=""genes-15-01101-f003"" ref-type=""fig"">Figure 3</xref>). Regarding intimal thickening, assessed by echocolor Doppler TSA, patients with the classic AFD variant had significantly higher right carotid IMT compared to other mutation subgroups, with an IMT value of 0.89 (<xref rid=""genes-15-01101-t002"" ref-type=""table"">Table 2</xref>, <xref rid=""genes-15-01101-f004"" ref-type=""fig"">Figure 4</xref>). No significant differences were observed in the left common carotid intimal thickness. Potential correlations between enzymatic activity and capillaroscopy and echocolor Doppler TSA findings that were significant in the hypothesis tests were also analyzed. No correlation was observed between alpha-galactosidase levels and capillaroscopy parameters, while Lyso-GB3 levels positively correlated with average capillary length (ῤ = 0.453; <italic toggle=""yes"">p</italic> = 0.059). Regarding intimal thickening, alpha-galactosidase and Lyso-GB3 levels correlated with right and left carotid IMT (<xref rid=""genes-15-01101-f005"" ref-type=""fig"">Figure 5</xref>). Using logistic and linear regression analyses for ordinal variables, various models were constructed with the significant capillaroscopy findings as the dependent variables and age, sex, alpha-galactosidase, Lyso-Gb3 levels, and the GLA gene variant subgroup as covariates in a stepwise manner. The classic AFD variant was associated with reduced average length (OR = 65, 95% CI 3.37–1251.28; <italic toggle=""yes"">p</italic> = 0.005), the absence of over 20% tortuosity (OR 0.090, 95% CI 0.009–0.879; <italic toggle=""yes"">p</italic> = 0.0384), over 30% ectasia presence (OR 14, <italic toggle=""yes"">p</italic> = 0.0453), and erythrocyte aggregation (OR 30; 95% CI 2.1–411, <italic toggle=""yes"">p</italic> = 0.010), regardless of the aforementioned confounding factors. The data regarding invisible subpapillary plexus significantly present in patients with VUS and late onset were not confirmed in logistic regression analysis; the only variable considered in the model was the Lyso-Gb3 value (OR = 4, <italic toggle=""yes"">p</italic> = 0.032). Finally, potential differences in capillaroscopy parameters between sexes were evaluated (<xref rid=""genes-15-01101-f006"" ref-type=""fig"">Figure 6</xref>). Significant differences were observed between the two sex-differentiated subgroups in neoangiogenesis, more prevalent in women, and altered average capillary length, more altered in men. Generally, we can state that men and women exhibit different but equally severe capillaroscopic alterations (<xref rid=""genes-15-01101-f007"" ref-type=""fig"">Figure 7</xref>). Exploratory analysis according to therapy status. We conducted an exploratory analysis to evaluate the impact of AFD-specific treatment on various microcirculatory parameters and clinical complications in our patient cohort, acknowledging the limited sample size for treated patients, which may likely affect the statistical significance of the findings. Given the additional difficulty of further dividing the data into subgroups based on the type of therapy, we compared a combined group of “treated” patients (on ERT or migalastat) with those not receiving therapy across multiple variables. Nevertheless, in an explorative way, we also compared patients on ERT with those on Migalastat and untreated ones. For microcirculatory characteristics, we compared all the available NFC parameters in the groups. The results revealed a statistically significant difference between the two groups only in “sub-papillary plexus” (<italic toggle=""yes"">p</italic> = 0.036). Other variables, including capillary flow (<italic toggle=""yes"">p</italic> = 0.133), inhomogeneity (<italic toggle=""yes"">p</italic> = 0.399), capillary density (<italic toggle=""yes"">p</italic> = 0.357), capillary tortuosity (<italic toggle=""yes"">p</italic> = 0.514), pseudovascular areas (<italic toggle=""yes"">p</italic> = 0.789), ectasias (<italic toggle=""yes"">p</italic> = 0.475), giant capillaries (<italic toggle=""yes"">p</italic> = 0.276), microhemorrhages (<italic toggle=""yes"">p</italic> = 0.568), edema (<italic toggle=""yes"">p</italic> = 0.227), thrombotic loops (<italic toggle=""yes"">p</italic> = 0.748), neoangiogenesis (<italic toggle=""yes"">p</italic> = 0.906), avascular areas (<italic toggle=""yes"">p</italic> = 0.390), and acrosyndrome (<italic toggle=""yes"">p</italic> = 0.562), did not show statistically significant differences. Further analysis was performed to differentiate between patients on ERT, those on migalastat, and those not receiving any therapy. The ANOVA results indicated that most variables did not differ significantly across the three groups. However, the “sub-papillary plexus“ variable approached statistical significance (<italic toggle=""yes"">p</italic> = 0.079), suggesting a potential trend in the difference between the groups, though this did not reach the level of significance. Regarding clinical complications, we examined variables such as hearing loss, cardiac ischemia, stroke or TIA, cardiac hypertrophy, and retinal vasculopathy. No statistically significant differences were observed between the groups for any of these complications, with <italic toggle=""yes"">p</italic>-values ranging from 0.114 to 0.269. In addressing the final question of our study, we sought to determine whether capillaroscopic findings could be associated with other microvascular and macrovascular manifestations. Erythrocyte aggregation phenomena (sludge), loops with tortuosity greater than 20%, and the presence of giant capillaries were more significantly observed in patients with hearing loss and LV hypertrophy. (<xref rid=""genes-15-01101-f008"" ref-type=""fig"">Figure 8</xref>). This study aimed to investigate nailfold capillaroscopy findings and eco-color Doppler examinations of the supra-aortic trunks in a cohort of patients with Anderson–Fabry disease, analyzing potential correlations with GLA gene mutation types, as a targeted diagnostic tool for improving early detection of the disease and optimizing continuous monitoring of patients. The results revealed significant capillaroscopic differences among patients with different GLA gene variant subgroups. Patients with the classic variant of AFD showed more significant capillaroscopic alterations than other variants: notably, reduced average capillary length, tortuosity of the loops under 20%, altered flow, erythrocyte aggregation, dilated subpapillary plexus, significantly increased ectasia, angiotectonic disorder, and neovascularization. Patients with VUSs predominantly exhibited loop tortuosity of 20–50%, angiotectonic disorder, and neovascularization. Patients with late-onset variants primarily exhibited loop tortuosity <20% and a non-visible subpapillary plexus. Across all genetic variant subgroups, there were no detected cases of avascular areas, giant capillaries, microhemorrhages, or thrombosed loops. Endothelial dysfunction in AFD has been widely described in the literature with in vitro and in vivo studies. Potential mechanisms include Gb3 accumulation in the endothelium, smooth muscle cell proliferation, increased IMT, heightened endothelial activation markers, a phenotypic shift towards a prothrombotic state, and reduced NO bioavailability. In AFD, a morphological and functional microangiopathy of the nailfold capillaries is evident. The first identification of dystrophic capillaries in AFD occurred in 1993, followed by additional case studies and series that, although limited in number, described capillaroscopic abnormalities in AFD patients and agreed that capillaroscopic results based on microcirculation studies can provide valuable information in pathophysiology, differential diagnosis, and therapy monitoring. Our findings align with previous studies in the field. The consistent observation of increased IMT and reduced FMD across multiple studies highlights the systemic vascular involvement in Fabry disease. For instance, Rombach et al. observed an increase in IMT and pulse wave velocity in the common carotid arteries and femoral arteries of AFD patients [<xref rid=""B53-genes-15-01101"" ref-type=""bibr"">53</xref>]. Their results showed a 9% increase in IMT for males and 8% for females, along with significant reductions in FMD, especially in males (−30%). Similarly, Wasik et al. noted thick capillaries and other pathological patterns in AFD patients, indicating microangiopathy through capillaroscopy [<xref rid=""B44-genes-15-01101"" ref-type=""bibr"">44</xref>]. Kalliokoski et al. described increases in IMT in multiple vessels, including the CCA and brachial artery, and the most considerable differences in abdominal aorta IMT, along with significant reductions in FMD. Their study revealed a 27% increase in aortic IMT and a 33% reduction in FMD, indicating extensive vascular involvement, aligning with McGill et al.’s findings that atherosclerotic lesions often initiate in this area [<xref rid=""B39-genes-15-01101"" ref-type=""bibr"">39</xref>,<xref rid=""B54-genes-15-01101"" ref-type=""bibr"">54</xref>]. The consistent observation of increased IMT across different studies highlights the pervasive impact of Fabry disease on the vascular system, while the thickening and structural changes in capillaries reflect the underlying endothelial dysfunction and deposition of glycolipids, which are central to Fabry disease pathophysiology [<xref rid=""B46-genes-15-01101"" ref-type=""bibr"">46</xref>]. Our study’s findings of capillaroscopic alterations, especially in patients with the classic variant of AFD and increased IMT, align with these results, underscoring the systemic vascular involvement in AFD and further supporting the utility of capillaroscopy in identifying early vascular changes in Fabry patients. Our study observed a significant increase in right common carotid IMT, although remaining within physiological dimensions. IMT is a marker of organ damage and is correlated with multi-organ damage. The literature indicates a significant increase in common carotid artery IMT in Fabry patients occurring in the absence of focal atherosclerotic plaques. Boutouyrie et al. observed accelerated arterial wall hypertrophy in medium-sized vessels in AFD patients, particularly a 2.3-fold increase in IMT in the radial artery where IMT widened more rapidly than in healthy controls [<xref rid=""B41-genes-15-01101"" ref-type=""bibr"">41</xref>]. A previous study by Costanzo et al. on Fabry disease mutation carriers found a 23% increase in carotid IMT without plaques and a 32% reduced brachial artery FMD, along with significant microangiopathy in nailfold capillaries, indicating early macrovascular involvement [<xref rid=""B46-genes-15-01101"" ref-type=""bibr"">46</xref>]. Barbey et al. found a 13% increase in IMT in male AFD patients and an 18% increase in females without the presence of plaques, revealing that only age correlated with common carotid artery IMT [<xref rid=""B34-genes-15-01101"" ref-type=""bibr"">34</xref>,<xref rid=""B43-genes-15-01101"" ref-type=""bibr"">43</xref>]. This aligns with our findings of increased IMT in the absence of atherosclerotic plaques, suggesting that the arterial thickening in Fabry disease is primarily due to glycolipid deposition rather than traditional atherosclerotic processes and emphasizing the importance of monitoring arterial thickening as a marker of vascular involvement in Fabry disease [<xref rid=""B40-genes-15-01101"" ref-type=""bibr"">40</xref>,<xref rid=""B41-genes-15-01101"" ref-type=""bibr"">41</xref>]. Increased carotid IMT has been shown to predict coronary atherosclerosis, coronary disease, and stroke development, even after adjusting for other cardiovascular risk factors [<xref rid=""B55-genes-15-01101"" ref-type=""bibr"">55</xref>,<xref rid=""B56-genes-15-01101"" ref-type=""bibr"">56</xref>,<xref rid=""B57-genes-15-01101"" ref-type=""bibr"">57</xref>], serving as a surrogate marker for generalized atherosclerosis [<xref rid=""B42-genes-15-01101"" ref-type=""bibr"">42</xref>]. Similar alterations in radial artery IMT, a medium-sized muscular artery, were also noted, a phenomenon unique to AFD among lysosomal storage disorders [<xref rid=""B40-genes-15-01101"" ref-type=""bibr"">40</xref>,<xref rid=""B58-genes-15-01101"" ref-type=""bibr"">58</xref>]. Most AFD patients in Barbey et al.‘s study had traditional cardiovascular risk factors contributing to notable carotid wall thickening [<xref rid=""B43-genes-15-01101"" ref-type=""bibr"">43</xref>]. Interestingly, despite increased IMT, no carotid bifurcation plaques were observed in these patients. Preserved or improved vasomotricity and vascular elasticity in AFD might represent adaptive changes providing apparent “cardioprotection” against the enzymatic defect [<xref rid=""B40-genes-15-01101"" ref-type=""bibr"">40</xref>]. Limited data exist on early cardiovascular damage in Fabry disease without cardiac hypertrophy. Studies by Costanzo and Monte et al. aimed to evaluate cardiac macrovascular and microvascular functions in Fabry mutation carriers without hypertrophy. They found preclinical cardiac function impairments using TDI and longitudinal deformation, early macrovascular involvement through IMT and FMD assessments, and microvascular alterations via capillaroscopy [<xref rid=""B46-genes-15-01101"" ref-type=""bibr"">46</xref>]. These results underscore early myocardial function anomalies and vascular system involvement in mutation carriers. AFD is associated with marked non-atherosclerotic arterial thickening. Evidence suggests increased IMT as a future cardiovascular event indicator, and preventive measures can reduce complication incidence. Whether carotid artery IMT stabilization or regression is a valid treatment efficacy indicator in AFD patients remains an area for further clinical research. Our study adds to this body of knowledge by demonstrating significant capillaroscopic differences among patients with different GLA gene variant subgroups. The pronounced capillaroscopic changes in patients with the classic variant of AFD suggest more severe microvascular involvement, contributing to the greater clinical severity observed in these patients. The findings from Wasik et al. and Costanzo et al. further support the utility of capillaroscopy in identifying early vascular changes in Fabry patients [<xref rid=""B44-genes-15-01101"" ref-type=""bibr"">44</xref>,<xref rid=""B46-genes-15-01101"" ref-type=""bibr"">46</xref>]. The presence of thick capillaries and other pathological patterns observed in these studies and corroborated by our findings reflect the underlying endothelial dysfunction and deposition of glycolipids that are central to Fabry disease pathophysiology. Wasik et al.‘s case–control study explored NFC as an additional diagnostic tool, revealing a significant presence of atypical capillaries, primarily bushy or clustered, compared to healthy controls. Other connective tissue disease characteristics like giant capillaries, avascular fields, and irregular architecture were not prevalent in AFD patients. Altered endothelial function due to intracellular glycosphingolipid accumulation and Stemper and Hilz’s hypothesis of altered terminal organ perfusion due to arteriovenous shunting and capillary inadequacy might explain NFC alterations [<xref rid=""B44-genes-15-01101"" ref-type=""bibr"">44</xref>,<xref rid=""B59-genes-15-01101"" ref-type=""bibr"">59</xref>]. Interestingly, nailfold capillary morphological changes were similar in hemi- and heterozygous Fabry patients and not age-dependent. Despite renal failure being a common complication in advanced AFD stages, no severe microangiopathy was noted in patients with significant nephropathy. The high incidence of Raynaud’s phenomenon, previously unreported, should be considered a cause of secondary Raynaud’s phenomenon in AFD. Glycosphingolipid accumulation induces small fiber neuropathy (autonomic and sensory), endothelial dysfunction, and smooth muscle cell proliferation, potentially affecting vascular tone and triggering Raynaud’s phenomenon. This phenomenon may partly cause extremity pain in nearly half of Fabry patients [<xref rid=""B44-genes-15-01101"" ref-type=""bibr"">44</xref>,<xref rid=""B45-genes-15-01101"" ref-type=""bibr"">45</xref>]. Deshayes et al. highlighted a higher prevalence of Raynaud’s phenomenon in AFD patients, particularly in males, with a 38% increase compared to controls, suggesting that microcirculatory dysfunction is a significant aspect of Fabry disease, particularly in males. However, our study did not reflect the unusually high frequency of Raynaud’s phenomenon observed in previous studies. Only 10% of our patients presented with Raynaud’s phenomenon, showing no preference for any AFD variant or the male sex, which is typically more susceptible to severe microcirculatory involvement. This discrepancy could be influenced by ERT, which was administered to 50% of our total sample and 80% of the male patients [<xref rid=""B45-genes-15-01101"" ref-type=""bibr"">45</xref>]. The differences between our findings and those of Deshayes et al. might be attributed to a higher male percentage in their control group or the improved microcirculation following treatment. Our study, to the best of our knowledge, is the first to investigate capillaroscopic anomalies in different mutational variant subgroups of Anderson–Fabry disease, confirming the utility of capillaroscopy in early diagnosis and clinical management. Notably, differences in capillaroscopic alterations between sexes were observed, specifically in neovascularization and average capillary length, paving the way for further wider studies focusing on sex differences and macro- and microvascular complications. The nailfold capillaroscopy method is well suited for global clinical application, thanks to the standardization of protocols and the reliability of the technique. Studies have shown that, with appropriate training and the use of standardized guidelines, capillaroscopic assessments can be consistently reproduced across different clinical settings and by doctors with varying levels of experience. The introduction of automated systems further enhances the objectivity and consistency of evaluations, reducing human error and making the process faster and more reliable. Additionally, the use of standardized terminology and evaluation criteria, as recommended by the EULAR Study Group, ensures that the same reference values can be applied worldwide, facilitating consistent and comparable results. This consensus in methodology underscores the global applicability of NC, enabling its use as a reliable tool in different clinical environments [<xref rid=""B48-genes-15-01101"" ref-type=""bibr"">48</xref>,<xref rid=""B49-genes-15-01101"" ref-type=""bibr"">49</xref>,<xref rid=""B50-genes-15-01101"" ref-type=""bibr"">50</xref>,<xref rid=""B51-genes-15-01101"" ref-type=""bibr"">51</xref>,<xref rid=""B52-genes-15-01101"" ref-type=""bibr"">52</xref>]. This study introduces capillaroscopy as a new tool for early diagnosis and continuous monitoring of Anderson–Fabry disease, highlighting the correlation between increased carotid IMT and Lyso-Gb3 accumulation. It recommends particular attention to certain capillaroscopic findings in the context of specific GLA gene mutations (classic, late-onset, and VUS). An exploratory analysis according to patients’ treatment status revealed a statistically significant difference between the two groups only in the presence of the “sub-papillary plexus”, without emerging differences in other parameters or vascular complications. While the data suggest that ERT may affect specific microcirculatory parameters like the “sub-papillary plexus”, it does not seem to significantly influence the broader range of capillary metrics or clinical complications. The current findings are limited by the small sample size, the heterogeneous duration of ERT among patients, which may have influenced the results and limits the generalizability of our findings, and the distribution of patients across therapies—specifically, with only 10 patients on ERT and 4 on migalastat. This fragmentation makes it difficult to draw definitive conclusions about the broader efficacy of these treatments on microcirculatory parameters and clinical outcomes. The observed trends, particularly regarding the presence of the sub-papillary plexus, suggest potential areas of impact, but further research with larger, more homogeneous patient groups is necessary to fully understand the clinical implications of these therapies. Clinically, this underscores the need for personalized treatment approaches and highlights the importance of closely monitoring microcirculatory changes in patients undergoing these therapies to optimize outcomes. Overall, this study has limitations including a modest sample size (due to the rarity of the disease), potential confounding factors (connective tissue diseases, diabetes mellitus), and technical difficulties (reproducibility of exams over time, patient availability). Future studies should aim to confirm our findings with larger cohorts and explore the long-term benefits of early diagnosis and treatment. In conclusion, our study confirms the utility of capillaroscopy in diagnosing and managing Anderson–Fabry disease. By highlighting specific capillaroscopic findings in the context of different GLA gene variant subgroups (classic, late-onset, and VUS), our research proposes capillaroscopy as a valuable tool for early diagnosis and continuous monitoring. Further studies are necessary to validate these findings and explore new therapeutic strategies for AFD patients.",N/A,21 8 2024
Case report: First diagnosis of Fabry disease in North Macedonia in a patient presenting with kidney failure on hemodialysis,,"Fabry–Anderson or Fabry disease (FD, OMIM#301500) is a rare X-linked lysosomal storage disorder resulting from the absence or impaired function of α-galactosidase A (GLA, OMIM*300644), an enzyme responsible for the catabolism of glycosphingolipids by hydrolysis of the terminal α-galactosyl moieties from glycolipids and glycoproteins. This leads to progressive lysosomal accumulation of globotriaosylceramide (Lyso-Gb3) in the cells throughout the human body and subsequent multiorgan failure (<xref rid=""B20"" ref-type=""bibr"">Michaud et al., 2020</xref>). This progressive and lifelong metabolic condition affects both genders (<xref rid=""B20"" ref-type=""bibr"">Michaud et al., 2020</xref>) and was first reported in 1897 before being later classified as sphingolipidosis (<xref rid=""B1"" ref-type=""bibr"">Anderson, 1898</xref>; <xref rid=""B10"" ref-type=""bibr"">Fabry, 1898</xref>). The biosynthesis of GLA is under the control of the <italic toggle=""yes"">GLA</italic> gene, which is located on chromosome Xq22.1 (<xref rid=""B1"" ref-type=""bibr"">Anderson, 1898</xref>); it contains seven exons with 1,290 coding nucleotides that encode a 49 kDa protein consisting of 429 amino acid residues, including a signal peptide of 31 residues (<xref rid=""B9"" ref-type=""bibr"">Duro et al., 2018</xref>). The Human Gene Mutation Database and ClinVar database (<xref rid=""B25"" ref-type=""bibr"">Stenson et al., 2020</xref>; <xref rid=""B3"" ref-type=""bibr"">ClinVar, 2024</xref>) report about 500 pathogenic <italic toggle=""yes"">GLA</italic> variants, including point missense and non-sense substitutions, duplications, deletions, splice sites, and complex mutations (<xref rid=""B8"" ref-type=""bibr"">Desnick, 2020</xref>). Genotype–phenotype correlations are generally poorly understood in FD because most patients have private pathogenic genetic variants. More extensive clinical studies with unrelated patients having the same genotype are required to gain further understanding of these relationships. It is well-known that complete loss of enzyme function leads to the <italic toggle=""yes"">classical early-onset form</italic> and reduced enzyme activity is associated with the <italic toggle=""yes"">late-onset form</italic> of FD; most patients with cardiac and kidney presentations also have missense variants with residual enzyme activities (<xref rid=""B28"" ref-type=""bibr"">Valtola et al., 2020</xref>; <xref rid=""B7"" ref-type=""bibr"">Chimenz et al., 2022</xref>). FD is a multisystem disorder with a wide spectrum of clinical symptoms due to mitochondrial dysfunction, blood vessel wall thickening, and endothelial dysfunction with microvessel luminal occlusions or thrombosis, which lead to progressive cardiovascular, cerebrovascular, and kidney dysfunctions (<xref rid=""B21"" ref-type=""bibr"">Paim-Marques et al., 2022</xref>). There are two major forms of FD, which are the classical and late-onset variants. The classical form is usually seen in hemizygous males with enzyme activities below 1% and very rarely in heterozygous females. The non-classical or late-onset form is characteristic of males with enzyme activities exceeding 1% and is the most common type manifesting in females, which is related to skewed X-chromosome inactivation (<xref rid=""B26"" ref-type=""bibr"">Stepien et al., 2023</xref>). The characteristic symptoms and signs of the <italic toggle=""yes"">classical form</italic> among children and adults are peripheral neuropathy with chronic burning as well as uncontrolled and unrelenting pain in the limbs (acroparesthesis) accompanied by abdominal cramps (<xref rid=""B7"" ref-type=""bibr"">Chimenz et al., 2022</xref>). Moreover, hypohidrosis or anhidrosis with dry skin, hot and cold exercise intolerance, angiokeratoma, and cornea verticillata are observed during childhood (<xref rid=""B7"" ref-type=""bibr"">Chimenz et al., 2022</xref>). Cardiovascular disorders (arrhythmias, myocardial infarction, heart failure, and sudden death), kidney disorders (microalbuminuria, proteinuria, glomerular hyperfiltration, and kidney failure), and central and autonomic nervous systems damage associated with the dorsal root ganglia (early stroke and transitory ischemic attacks) are the most common causes of morbidity and mortality in patients with FD. The late-onset form may not present with any symptoms until a later age, but it may still progress to life-threatening complications (<xref rid=""B26"" ref-type=""bibr"">Stepien et al., 2023</xref>). Recognizing the constellation of clinical symptoms and signs will lead to clinical suspicion, which can be assessed by confirmatory enzyme, biomarker, and genetic tests (<xref rid=""B30"" ref-type=""bibr"">Wanner et al., 2023</xref>); however, the rarity of the condition and late-onset forms with atypical presentations can make diagnosis very challenging and may often require lengthy diagnostic processes. Introducing guidelines for appropriate screening in high-risk populations would therefore be helpful for identifying patients and their relatives at early or presymptomatic stages of the disease (<xref rid=""B30"" ref-type=""bibr"">Wanner et al., 2023</xref>). In this article, we describe the first diagnosed case of FD in North Macedonia, including six additional symptomatic and presymptomatic relatives in this family who carry the identified pathogenic <italic toggle=""yes"">GLA</italic> variant. A 45-year-old male was admitted to the University Hospital of Nephrology, Skopje, North Macedonia, with kidney failure (KF) requiring hemodialysis (HD). The patient presented with dysuria, anemia (Hgb 78 g/L, reference value: 120–180 g/L), proteinuria (2.2 g/24 h, reference value: < 0.2 g/24 h), high level of blood nitrogen urea (BUN 45 mmol/L, reference value: 2.7–7.8 mmol/L), elevated serum creatinine (1,193 μmol/L, reference value: 45–109 μmol/L), hyperkalemia (5.9 mmol/L, reference value: 3.8–5.5 mmol/L), hyperphosphatemia (2.14 mmol/L, reference value: 0.8–1.4 mmol/L), hypocalcemia (1.9 mmol/L, reference value: 2.1–2.6 mmol/L), and muscle pains. The patient began chronic HD therapy via a central femoral vein catheter and received transfusions with filtered red blood cells. He has had a 10-year medical history of high blood pressure that was treated with antihypertensive drugs and gradual increases in BUN and serum creatinine levels with subnephrotic range of proteinuria over the last 2 years; however, he had not consulted a nephrologist. From an early age, he presented with uncontrolled burning chronic pain in the limbs, intermittent abdominal pain, as well as cold and heat intolerance. An ultrasound examination showed small-sized kidneys (right kidney 86 × 42 mm and left kidney 86 × 43 mm) with hyperechogenic parenchyma (12–13 mm), and the electrocardiogram showed sinus tachycardia (heart rate: 110/min) with inverse T wave in the precordial leads. The patient was discharged from the hospital with an initial diagnosis of KF requiring regular HD. Over the next 6 months, the patient underwent further examinations to prepare him for live-donor kidney transplantation from his sister. During this period, nephrologists who had recently completed a training course on FD in a specialized center in Bulgaria suggested additional testing for FD based on the early onset of KF and history of acroparesthesias, abdominal cramps, anhidrosis, and cornea verticillata. Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) demonstrated concentric hypertrophic cardiomyopathy with end-diastolic thickness of the interventricular septum and posterior wall. A more detailed examination of the family history revealed similar symptoms in his daughter (acroparesthesias, abdominal cramps, and anhidrosis) and in a maternal cousin who was also a kidney transplant recipient with a history of acroparesthesias, abdominal cramps, and anhidrosis. The enzyme and biomarker tests showed almost undetectable GLA activity (0.1 μmol/L/h, normal: >2.8 μmol/L/h) and greatly elevated Lyso-Gb3 (73.3 ng/mL, normal: <3.5 ng/mL). The genetic testing identified a previously reported pathogenic <italic toggle=""yes"">GLA</italic> hemizygous variant NM_000169.3 (GLA): c.443G>A or p.(Ser148Asn) (<xref rid=""B2"" ref-type=""bibr"">Ashton-Prolla et al., 2000</xref>), ClinVar ID 496827, which was absent in the population databases. The enzyme, biomarker, and diagnostic genetic tests of the proband and subsequent cascade testing in the family were performed using dried blood spots in ARHIMEDlife<sup>®</sup>, a commercial diagnostic laboratory accredited according to the ISO 15189 standard. Subsequently, the patient underwent a successful kidney transplantation from his non-carrier sister. A detailed family history identified 18 individuals across three generations in the patient’s pedigree (<xref rid=""F1"" ref-type=""fig"">Figure 1</xref>). Personal histories, clinical findings, and subsequent enzyme, biomarker, and genetic analyses (<xref rid=""T1"" ref-type=""table"">Table 1</xref>) identified another six affected cases (positive for the <italic toggle=""yes"">GLA</italic> variant). The proband’s 14-year-old daughter (IV-2) presented specific clinical manifestations from an early age, including cornea verticillata, acroparesthesia, abdominal cramps, and anhidrosis. Her laboratory examinations demonstrated microalbuminuria (30 g/L), intermittent proteinuria, normal GLA activity, and mildly elevated level of Lyso-Gb3 (<xref rid=""T1"" ref-type=""table"">Table 1</xref>). The proband’s cousin (III-3) received a kidney transplant 5 years before based on a finding of focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS) or IgA nephropathy from a kidney biopsy many years prior to KF; he also showed acroparesthesias, anhidrosis, and sinus tachycardia. His cardiac MRI demonstrated concentric hypertrophic cardiomyopathy with end-diastolic thickness of the interventricular septum and posterior wall, which is a typical finding in FD. He had undetectable GLA activity and greatly elevated Lyso-Gb3 (<xref rid=""T1"" ref-type=""table"">Table 1</xref>). The four other carrier females in this family had borderline (II-1 and II-2) or reduced levels (IV-4 and IV-5) of enzyme activities and slightly elevated Lyso-Gb3 levels (<xref rid=""T1"" ref-type=""table"">Table 1</xref>). The remaining four members of the family proved to be non-carries of the pathogenic <italic toggle=""yes"">GLA</italic> variant, with normal enzyme activities and normal Lyso-Gb3 levels. Rare diseases affect more than 400 million people globally, and their timely diagnosis and treatment remain challenging, especially in countries with limited health resources (<xref rid=""B29"" ref-type=""bibr"">Verma et al., 2022</xref>). The affected individuals in under-resourced countries usually experience lengthy diagnostic odysseys, during which life-threatening complications may occur sometimes (<xref rid=""B29"" ref-type=""bibr"">Verma et al., 2022</xref>). On average, patients with FD are examined by 7–10 different specialists before an accurate diagnosis is made (<xref rid=""B16"" ref-type=""bibr"">Kudumija et al., 2007</xref>). Studies have shown that the diagnostic procedures can be very lengthy: 13 years for men and 17 years for women (<xref rid=""B13"" ref-type=""bibr"">Hoffmann and Mayatepek, 2009</xref>). The reasons for this are the rarity of the condition, heterogeneous and variable clinical course of FD, especially in women, and broad range of possible differential diagnoses (<xref rid=""B13"" ref-type=""bibr"">Hoffmann and Mayatepek, 2009</xref>). Newborn screening for FD is important because children who are diagnosed and treated early may have normal growth and development. However, healthcare systems in the United States, United Kingdom, Canada, several countries in Europe, Taiwan, and Japan have well-developed and implemented newborn screening programs (<xref rid=""B12"" ref-type=""bibr"">Gragnaniello et al., 2023</xref>). Thus far, FD is not part of the national newborn screening program in North Macedonia. In this geographical region, the first cases of FD were identified much earlier than the current family, for example, in Bulgaria in 1963, in Slovenia in 1991, and in Serbia in 2009 (<xref rid=""B15"" ref-type=""bibr"">Kotnik et al., 2005</xref>; <xref rid=""B22"" ref-type=""bibr"">Paskalev et al., 2011</xref>; <xref rid=""B6"" ref-type=""bibr"">Ćelić et al., 2022</xref>). Previously, efforts to individually test for FD were performed in highly suspect patients in North Macedonia many years ago. One of these patients had a positive test, but further investigation and family screening for the disease were not pursued, and the case was not reported as well. High awareness and proper education are essential for early recognition, diagnosis, understanding, and management of FD. Therefore, close cooperation with centers with higher expertise in FD is crucial for early diagnoses and treatments of patients with FD in developing countries. In our case, the index patient was identified through enzyme, biomarker, and genetic tests after preliminary findings of KF and cardiomyopathy, which were clinically highly suspect for FD, and the remaining cases were confirmed through family screening and pedigree analysis. The first cases of FD were similarly identified in Serbia and Bulgaria, where later screening among the high-risk patients on HD was also carried out (<xref rid=""B22"" ref-type=""bibr"">Paskalev et al., 2011</xref>; <xref rid=""B6"" ref-type=""bibr"">Ćelić et al., 2022</xref>). The prevalence of FD is estimated to be 1 in 17,000–117,000 newborns (<xref rid=""B12"" ref-type=""bibr"">Gragnaniello et al., 2023</xref>), and according to the population of North Macedonia (census 2021: 1,836,713 inhabitants), the estimated number of patients with FD would be 16 to 46 individuals; here, the lower end of the range would possibly indicate the number of patients with the classical form and the higher end of the spectrum could include the milder forms of FD. We identified a Macedonian family with seven affected family members who carried the pathogenic <italic toggle=""yes"">GLA</italic> variant Ser148Asn. Both males in the family had the classical form of FD, with less than 1% enzyme activity and markedly elevated levels of Lyso-Gb3. They both developed end-stage kidney disease, requiring kidney replacement therapy in the fourth decade of their life. The same <italic toggle=""yes"">GLA</italic> genetic variant had previously been described in patients with the classical FD phenotype, including male individuals with cardiomyopathy and KF requiring dialysis as well as females with less-severe symptoms and longer life expectancies (<xref rid=""B2"" ref-type=""bibr"">Ashton-Prolla et al., 2000</xref>). The <italic toggle=""yes"">GLA</italic> variant identified in the present family has been previously reported in two brothers with classical FD and shown in the transfection study to reduce GLA enzyme activity to under 0.1% compared to the controls (<xref rid=""B24"" ref-type=""bibr"">Shimotori et al., 2008</xref>). Another study identified this <italic toggle=""yes"">GLA</italic> variant in a 43-year-old male patient with classical FD having serum creatinine level of 3 mg/dL (265 μmol/L), renal cortical cysts, increased renal echogenicity, and decreased corticomedullary differentiation (<xref rid=""B23"" ref-type=""bibr"">Ronald et al., 2004</xref>). Two studies reported two male patients with classical FD hemizygous for different missense substitutions affecting the same amino acid residue Ser148Arg; one of these patients had reduced GLA levels of 0.4 U/mL, while the other was a 37-year-old patient having a creatinine level of 4 mg/dL (353 μmol/L) with ultrasound/MRI findings of renal cortical cysts, parapelvic cysts, increased renal echogenicity, scarring, and decreased corticomedullary differentiation. Interestingly, the same study also reported a 36-year-old female with the same <italic toggle=""yes"">GLA</italic> variant (presumably a female relative) with borderline serum creatinine level of 1.2 mg/dL (106.1 μmol/L) and MRI findings of renal cortical cysts, renal atrophy, and decreased corticomedullary differentiation (<xref rid=""B27"" ref-type=""bibr"">Topaloglu et al., 1999</xref>). Female FD patients can present with a wide range of clinical symptoms, and the severity of the manifestation depends on the degree to which the normal X-chromosome is inactivated in various tissues (<xref rid=""B17"" ref-type=""bibr"">MacDermot et al., 2001</xref>). It was found that up to 90% of heterozygous females may have mild clinical manifestations of FD, while up to 30% exhibited multiple and serious disease manifestations, including transient ischemic attacks, stroke, and KF (<xref rid=""B17"" ref-type=""bibr"">MacDermot et al., 2001</xref>). Our study describes the clinical features of five female patients heterozygous for the Ser148Asn genetic variant. The most severe clinical presentation was in a 14-year-old girl, who presented with acroparesthesias, abdominal cramps, cornea verticillata, and microalbuminuria despite having normal enzyme activity. The symptoms began from an early age as inexplicable abdominal pains, burning chronic pain in the limbs with transient edema. This finding corresponded with data from the Fabry Outcome Survey on 358 female patients, which showed that enzyme activities in the peripheral blood leukocytes did not correlate with disease severity in females (<xref rid=""B19"" ref-type=""bibr"">Mehta et al., 2004</xref>). Two female patients had cardiomyopathy and cerebrovascular incidents later on in life (above 70 years), one had isolated microalbuminuria (30 g/L) at the age of 18, and only one out of the five female patients in our series was asymptomatic at 9 years of age. Therapy for FD includes enzyme replacement and non-enzyme-based medications (<xref rid=""B4"" ref-type=""bibr"">Besekar et al., 2023</xref>). Enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) with recombinant human GLA enzyme (Agalsidase-α or Agalsidase-β) improves the clinical signs and symptoms of FD, such as kidney dysfunction, neuropathic pain, gastrointestinal disorders, and cardiac manifestations; the treatment reduces Lyso-Gb3 accumulation and delays organ damage (<xref rid=""B5"" ref-type=""bibr"">Biegstraaten et al., 2015</xref>). In 2015, the European Fabry Working Group published the recommendations for initiation and cessation of ERT in patients with FD (<xref rid=""B5"" ref-type=""bibr"">Biegstraaten et al., 2015</xref>); in 2020, the opinion-based PREDICT-FD modified Delphi consensus initiative considered the early indicators of disease progression in FD for disease-specific treatment initiation (<xref rid=""B14"" ref-type=""bibr"">Hughes et al., 2020</xref>). According to these recommendations and consensus initiatives, initiation of therapy is advised in all males with classical FD as soon as there are early clinical indicators of kidney, heart, or brain involvement, but should be considered in classical male patients ≥16 years of age even in the absence of clinical signs or symptoms of organ involvement. In classically affected females and males with non-classical FD, treatments should begin as soon as there is early clinical evidence of kidney, heart, or brain involvement, but may be considered in females with non-classical FD with early clinical signs that are considered to be due to FD (<xref rid=""B5"" ref-type=""bibr"">Biegstraaten et al., 2015</xref>; <xref rid=""B14"" ref-type=""bibr"">Hughes et al., 2020</xref>). However, there is a general agreement in literature indicating the benefits of early treatment in FD. As an alternative to intravenous ERT, the administration of migalastat, a first-in-class oral chaperone therapy, has shown favorable outcomes in FD patients with amenable mutations (<xref rid=""B11"" ref-type=""bibr"">Gjorgjievski et al., 2023</xref>). The Ser148Asn variant detected in our patients is not amenable to migalastat (<xref rid=""B18"" ref-type=""bibr"">McCafferty and Scott, 2019</xref>), and The National Commission for Rare Diseases approved the initiation of ERT for the two male patients (but not for the symptomatic female patient), according to the criteria proposed by the European Fabry Working Group. However, our aim is to provide comprehensive therapy for every affected member based on medical evidence. In conclusion, the diagnosis of FD is a great challenge for clinicians and requires a high degree of knowledge of the disease as well as detailed family histories of highly suspicious cases (<xref rid=""B30"" ref-type=""bibr"">Wanner et al., 2023</xref>). This report provides a detailed description of the clinical symptoms, signs, age of onset, and evolution over time in multiple family members carrying the same pathogenic mutation associated with FD, which is a small contribution to the establishment of genotype–phenotype correlation (<xref rid=""T2"" ref-type=""table"">Table 2</xref>). Enzyme, biomarker, and genetic tests of dried blood spot samples facilitate wider applications of such testing procedures. In the future, it will be necessary to conduct a more comprehensive screening of the clinically suspected patients in our country, including patients with KF on kidney replacement therapy. We believe that the formation of a multispecialty team would contribute to the early diagnosis and timely initiation of therapies in patients with FD to prevent permanent organ damage.",N/A,14 8 2024
Fabry Disease Rat Model Develops Age- and Sex-Dependent Anterior Segment Ocular Abnormalities,,"  Ocular manifestations in patients with Fabry disease are predominantly considered limited to corneal verticillata for diagnosis. Early detection improves the patient's quality of life with prompt treatment. However, the role of this and other ocular manifestations, primarily related to the progressive nature and sex dependence of Fabry disease pathology, is meager. Recent work suggests vascular anomalies and corneal/lens opacifications are the ocular indicators of Fabry disease.<xref rid=""bib28"" ref-type=""bibr""><sup>28</sup></xref><sup>–</sup><xref rid=""bib30"" ref-type=""bibr""><sup>30</sup></xref> Additionally, conjunctival vascular aneurysms, corneal or retinal vessel tortuosity, and lenticular opacities were also reported in the patients with Fabry disease.<xref rid=""bib15"" ref-type=""bibr""><sup>15</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid=""bib31"" ref-type=""bibr""><sup>31</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid=""bib32"" ref-type=""bibr""><sup>32</sup></xref> However, these sporadic studies do not highlight the significance of age, sex, or genotype in this X-linked lysosomal storage disease, making a more extensive population study difficult, particularly in female subjects who are heterozygous with variable phenotypic expression due to X-chromosome inactivation. In 2018, Miller et al.<xref rid=""bib25"" ref-type=""bibr""><sup>25</sup></xref> developed an α-Gal A KO rat model of Fabry disease using CRISPR/Cas9 technology at the Medical College of Wisconsin to investigate systemic abnormalities further and advance our understanding of Fabry disease pathophysiology. Their research recapitulated the progression of Fabry disease in the rat, namely neuropathic pain, vascular disease, and the indiscriminate presence of α-galactosyl glycosphingolipids in both the cornea and lens. Until then, mouse models had not been known to demonstrate ocular pathology,<xref rid=""bib33"" ref-type=""bibr""><sup>33</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid=""bib34"" ref-type=""bibr""><sup>34</sup></xref> giving a significant advantage to the Fabry rat model. Since then, the model revealed abnormalities in Fabry disease-induced anterior and posterior segments of the rat eye. Ocular findings were notable, not only for cornea verticillata but for Fabry cataracts and anterior lens damage. Building upon our previous report,<xref rid=""bib9"" ref-type=""bibr""><sup>9</sup></xref> this study provides a more comprehensive depiction of corneal and lenticular opacities through additional clinical indicators of IOP, TBUT, corneal epithelial integrity, CCT, and ACD. The age-dependent increase in IOP might be due to several factors, such as aqueous humor dynamics and blood volume.<xref rid=""bib35"" ref-type=""bibr""><sup>35</sup></xref> The trabecular meshwork (TM) plays a vital role in the passage of aqueous humor, and the elasticity of TM decreases with age. At older ages, the drainage capacity of aqueous humor through the pores decreases due to the thickening of elastic fibers and increased extracellular matrix of the TM, leading to increased resistance of aqueous outflow through the pores, leading to increased IOP. In addition to the physiology of the aqueous humor, the blood volume that flows through the retinal, choroidal arteries, and veins also has a role in fluctuating the IOP levels.<xref rid=""bib36"" ref-type=""bibr""><sup>36</sup></xref> Although IOP has been greatly overlooked in Fabry disease,<xref rid=""bib37"" ref-type=""bibr""><sup>37</sup></xref> international Fabry registries indicate that 57% to 67% of patients develop hypertension associated with renal dysfunction.<xref rid=""bib38"" ref-type=""bibr""><sup>38</sup></xref> Previous studies suggest that hypertension could increase aqueous humor production due to elevated ciliary blood flow and capillary pressure, and aqueous outflow may be decreased due to increased episcleral venous pressure,<xref rid=""bib38"" ref-type=""bibr""><sup>38</sup></xref> suggesting decreased outflow and IOP increase with age. Another possibility of increased IOP could be due to the increase in CCT. The age dependent increase in CCT affects the anterior chamber volume by the movement of posterior corneal endothelial surface, thus affecting the IOP levels.<xref rid=""bib39"" ref-type=""bibr""><sup>39</sup></xref> In the present study, there was a significant increase in IOP with age in the male Fabry rats (<italic toggle=""yes"">Gla<sup>+/0</sup></italic> and <italic toggle=""yes"">Gla<sup>−/0</sup></italic>) and not in female rats, suggesting male rats are more susceptible to damage in aqueous humor dynamics owing to the sex-dependent and X-linked nature of Fabry disease. A rising IOP indicates a fluid build-up in the anterior chamber due to possible outflow obstruction in the TM by GLA substrate deposits distally or due to age-dependent increase in CCT. As a result, constant exertion of pressure could put patients with Fabry disease at a higher risk of irreparable damage to the optic nerve. Further study on the risk of glaucoma in patients with Fabry disease would be beneficial to help inform if screening for glaucoma should be part of their multidisciplinary care. The precorneal tear film (PTF) overlays on the exposed surfaces of the cornea and bulbar conjunctiva, providing lubrication for the cornea and conjunctiva. It facilitates solute exchange, contributes to antimicrobial defense, and is a medium to remove debris from the ocular surface.<xref rid=""bib40"" ref-type=""bibr""><sup>40</sup></xref> The TBUT measures PTF integrity that may contribute to dry eye syndrome (DES). Despite its applicability to the clinic, this correlation has yet to be well elucidated in patients with Fabry disease. Here, we found that adult or aged Fabry rats, predominantly KO male (<italic toggle=""yes"">Gla<sup>−/0</sup></italic>) and HET female (<italic toggle=""yes"">Gla<sup>−/+</sup></italic>) rats, exhibited significantly decreased TBUT older than 25 weeks of age. The decreased TBUT hints that the degenerative nature of tear quality is linked to pathological progression in patients with Fabry disease. A previous case study<xref rid=""bib41"" ref-type=""bibr""><sup>41</sup></xref> found progressively worsening vision, stinging and burning of the eyes, and occasional foreign body sensation in patients with Fabry disease. Further evaluation in our rat model revealed a DES consistent with Fabry disease, with the mechanisms still under question. One of the explanations for decreased corneal epithelial integrity may be autonomic impairment, causing decreased tears and saliva formation because of the classical lysosomal dysfunction noted in Fabry disease.<xref rid=""bib15"" ref-type=""bibr""><sup>15</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid=""bib42"" ref-type=""bibr""><sup>42</sup></xref> Corneal opacities, often clinically described as cornea verticillata in patients with Fabry disease, are one of the most prevalent ocular symptoms found in the rat model of Fabry disease.<xref rid=""bib9"" ref-type=""bibr""><sup>9</sup></xref> The corneal epithelium and surrounding anterior stroma are home to these whorl-shaped, linear opacities in the inferior region of the cornea.<xref rid=""bib43"" ref-type=""bibr""><sup>43</sup></xref> These modifications in the cornea, nevertheless, have been a central aspect in recent studies on the eyes and served as one of the best early diagnostic tools for detecting Fabry disease because it is so specific to the disease and pathognomonic in the absence of an offending medication. Given the consequences of corneal deposits, a compromise in the integrity of epithelial cells can imply deterioration of the cellular processes that support ocular structures in the anterior segment of the eye. In the present study, corneal fluorescein staining, which highlighted areas of epithelial disruption, was increased with age in Fabry rats. Corneal deposits were also conspicuous in aged rats, especially among KO male rats (<italic toggle=""yes"">Gla<sup>−/0</sup></italic>), HET females (<italic toggle=""yes"">Gla<sup>−/+</sup></italic>), and KO females (<italic toggle=""yes"">Gla<sup>−/−</sup></italic>) rats. It has been extensively documented that a loss of function of the <italic toggle=""yes"">Gla</italic> gene makes male patients with Fabry disease more susceptible and confers a buildup of glycosphingolipid, which lends itself to the progression of vascular, corneal, and lens aberrations found in the Fabry rats. Additional toxic substrates, such as globotriaosylceramide (Gb3) and globotriaosylsphingosine (Lyso-Gb3), can be related to the severity of symptoms; an increased amount has been discovered in <italic toggle=""yes"">Gla</italic> KO models.<xref rid=""bib44"" ref-type=""bibr""><sup>44</sup></xref> The buildup of these substrates can be present in different ways, such as in the clinical condition of cornea verticillata or vortex keratopathy. Without other significant systemic symptoms, cornea verticillata is a highly specific and sensitive finding for Fabry disease; hence, its presence in a patient is clinically essential when making a diagnosis. Its rarity in healthy individuals underscores its importance in assessing pathology. This finding can often be the sole indication of Fabry disease, yet the extent of its development has not been demonstrated as a predictor of disease severity. Next, we measured CCT and ACD in Fabry rats using AS-OCT as two additional indicators of ocular anomalies in disease pathology. We observed that aged male and female rats had an overwhelmingly increased CCT post-young age (>25 weeks old) across genotypes but were most predominantly noticed in KO female (<italic toggle=""yes"">Gla<sup>−/−</sup></italic>) and KO male (<italic toggle=""yes"">Gla<sup>−/0</sup></italic>) rats. Similarly, ACD differences were prominent in older rats compared to the young ones, highlighting the age-dependent contribution of glycosphingolipid deposits to the pathological findings in Fabry rats. Prior studies have alluded to similar results, with Miller and colleagues positing that Gb3 accumulation will lead to downstream dysfunction and injury of cells.<xref rid=""bib9"" ref-type=""bibr""><sup>9</sup></xref> Lens opacities are also widely demonstrated in patients with Fabry disease, more frequently in male patients than in female patients in their second decade of life.<xref rid=""bib31"" ref-type=""bibr""><sup>31</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid=""bib43"" ref-type=""bibr""><sup>43</sup></xref> Similarly, male rats developed more lens opacities than WT rats in the present study. The affected male cohorts were almost exclusively found in older age due to the deposition of Gb3 and related α-galactosyl glycosphingolipids contributing to the opacification of the lens, primarily via dysfunction of epithelial cells and impaired oxidation of lenticular lipids. Lens opacities on the posterior lens have been previously documented, but an excessive accumulation is thought to be rare even in Fabry individuals. A study in 2016 determined that the development of lens opacities often denotes extensive systemic and pathological involvement.<xref rid=""bib44"" ref-type=""bibr""><sup>44</sup></xref> Hence, patients presenting with Fabry disease with cataracts frequently have manifestations of other systemic pathologies. On average, patients with Fabry disease consult 10 specialists before receiving a correct diagnosis. Identifying initial signs is imperative in curbing systemic involvement and symptom severity. The results of the present study indicate increased severity of ocular abnormalities in KO male rats (<italic toggle=""yes"">Gla<sup>−/0</sup></italic>) and aged Fabry rats. Furthermore, all rats became ocular manifestations over time, with aging and sex being some of the determinants in the advancement of Fabry symptoms. The findings advance our knowledge and expand our understanding of this X-linked lysosomal storage disease by demonstrating the cumulative effects of age, sex, and genotype-dependent ocular manifestation in the anterior segment of the eyes. Our study describes several anterior segment ocular manifestations of Fabry disease in a rat animal model and how they may change with sex, gender, and genotype. In addition, we demonstrated increasing IOP in our rats, which is a significant risk factor for glaucoma and may warrant further study in human patients. Early diagnosis can slow progression with ERT and chaperone therapy. ",N/A,07 8 2024
Dynamics of Leukocyte Telomere Length in Patients with Fabry Disease,"Fabry disease (FD) leads to significant morbidity and mortality, which may indicate accelerated ageing. However, it is still unclear whether there is a relationship between telomere length (TL), a marker of biological ageing, and disease outcome. We aimed to examine the relationship between leukocyte TL (LTL) dynamics and the presence of advanced disease stages and/or late complications of FD, including hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, nephropathy and stroke, both cross-sectionally and longitudinally. DNA was extracted from peripheral blood leukocytes and quantitative PCR was utilized to determine relative LTL in 99 Fabry patients. In the longitudinal analysis, we included 50 patients in whom at least three measurements were performed over a period of 5–10 years. The results showed a significant inverse correlation between LTL and age (ρ = −0.20, <italic toggle=""yes"">p</italic> = 0.05). No significant differences in LTL were found between females and males (<italic toggle=""yes"">p</italic> = 0.79) or between patients receiving disease-specific therapy and those without (<italic toggle=""yes"">p</italic> = 0.34). In a cross-sectional analysis, no association was found between the presence (<italic toggle=""yes"">p</italic> = 0.15) or number (<italic toggle=""yes"">p</italic> = 0.28) of advanced stages of the disease and/or late complications and LTL. Similarly, in a longitudinal analysis, no difference in LTL dynamics was found regarding the presence (<italic toggle=""yes"">p</italic> = 0.16) of advanced stage organ involvement and/or late complications or their number. These findings indicate that LTL dynamics in adulthood may not be a reliable indicator of disease outcomes in Fabry patients. Therefore, LTL may more accurately reflect the disease burden in early life, when TL is primarily determined.","Fabry disease (FD) is a rare genetic lysosomal disorder characterized by an accumulation of glycosphingolipids due to the insufficient activity of α-galactosidase A [<xref rid=""B1-biomedicines-12-01724"" ref-type=""bibr"">1</xref>]. The accumulation of globotriaosylceramide (Gb3) in various cells and the extracellular accumulation of globotriaosylsphingosine (lyso-Gb3), a soluble form of Gb3, leads to tissue damage [<xref rid=""B2-biomedicines-12-01724"" ref-type=""bibr"">2</xref>,<xref rid=""B3-biomedicines-12-01724"" ref-type=""bibr"">3</xref>,<xref rid=""B4-biomedicines-12-01724"" ref-type=""bibr"">4</xref>]. Clinical manifestations in females range from asymptomatic to severe, due to X-linked inheritance and lyonization [<xref rid=""B5-biomedicines-12-01724"" ref-type=""bibr"">5</xref>,<xref rid=""B6-biomedicines-12-01724"" ref-type=""bibr"">6</xref>,<xref rid=""B7-biomedicines-12-01724"" ref-type=""bibr"">7</xref>]. Established disease-specific therapies (DSTs) for FD include replacing the deficiency of endogenous α-galactosidase A with a recombinant enzyme or increasing the activity of the enzyme with chaperones [<xref rid=""B8-biomedicines-12-01724"" ref-type=""bibr"">8</xref>]. Despite the availability of these treatments, Fabry patients still have a shorter life expectancy than the general population, with untreated males living up to 20 years less and females up to 5 years less [<xref rid=""B9-biomedicines-12-01724"" ref-type=""bibr"">9</xref>]. FD is therefore thought to be associated with premature ageing [<xref rid=""B10-biomedicines-12-01724"" ref-type=""bibr"">10</xref>]. Telomere length (TL) is considered one of the main hallmarks of ageing, as it decreases with age [<xref rid=""B11-biomedicines-12-01724"" ref-type=""bibr"">11</xref>]. In humans, telomeres consist of non-coding tandem TTAGGG DNA sequences that cap the end of chromosomes [<xref rid=""B12-biomedicines-12-01724"" ref-type=""bibr"">12</xref>]. Their main function is to maintain the integrity of the genome by preventing DNA damage recognition at the end of chromosomes and the loss of genetic information [<xref rid=""B13-biomedicines-12-01724"" ref-type=""bibr"">13</xref>]. However, telomeres shorten with each cell division due to the end replication problem [<xref rid=""B14-biomedicines-12-01724"" ref-type=""bibr"">14</xref>]. The shortening continues until they reach a critically short length. Then, replicative senescence occurs, which leads to a permanent cell cycle arrest [<xref rid=""B15-biomedicines-12-01724"" ref-type=""bibr"">15</xref>]. Telomere shortening is associated with various age-related diseases [<xref rid=""B16-biomedicines-12-01724"" ref-type=""bibr"">16</xref>] and may increase the risk of overall and cause-specific mortality [<xref rid=""B17-biomedicines-12-01724"" ref-type=""bibr"">17</xref>,<xref rid=""B18-biomedicines-12-01724"" ref-type=""bibr"">18</xref>]. The role of telomere shortening in kidney diseases has also been investigated, but the results are inconclusive [<xref rid=""B19-biomedicines-12-01724"" ref-type=""bibr"">19</xref>]. FD is associated with increased inflammation and oxidative stress, which may have a negative impact on TL [<xref rid=""B20-biomedicines-12-01724"" ref-type=""bibr"">20</xref>]. Therefore, a link between the presence of a severe phenotype and faster telomere shortening may be biologically plausible. However, studies on TL in patients with FD are scarce. A recent study found shorter TL in men compared to age-matched controls [<xref rid=""B21-biomedicines-12-01724"" ref-type=""bibr"">21</xref>]. However, there are currently no longitudinal studies that have measured TL over time and investigated the association between changes in TL and the occurrence of advanced disease stage and/or complications, particularly hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCMP), kidney dysfunction and stroke in patients with FD. The aim of the study is to investigate the relationship between leukocyte TL (LTL) and the occurrence of advanced disease stage and/or complications in a cohort of Fabry patients by performing both cross-sectional and longitudinal analyses over a period of up to 10 years. Understanding the role of TL shortening may help to elucidate the role of premature ageing in Fabry patients, believed to reduce their life expectancy and contribute to the disease progression [<xref rid=""B21-biomedicines-12-01724"" ref-type=""bibr"">21</xref>].   Predicting the clinical course of FD is challenging due to the great variability of the clinical presentation. Therefore, better prognostic information is needed to guide the management of Fabry patients. The role of telomere biology in disease progression in Fabry patients and its potential use as a biomarker for the disease remains elusive. This study is the first to investigate the association between LTL dynamics and the occurrence or number of advanced disease stages and/or late complications in patients with FD, both cross-sectionally and longitudinally. The cross-sectional analysis revealed no associations between LTL and advanced disease stage and/or complications. The longitudinal analysis yielded similar results, suggesting that there is no relationship between the development of an advanced disease stage and/or complications and LTL dynamics. Previous studies in the general population have shown that TL shortens by 50–150 bp per year [<xref rid=""B14-biomedicines-12-01724"" ref-type=""bibr"">14</xref>]. Therefore, a significant negative correlation between LTL and age, as found in our study, was to be expected. Other factors that have been reported to influence LTL include sex, with studies showing that LTL is equivalent between boys and girls at birth [<xref rid=""B27-biomedicines-12-01724"" ref-type=""bibr"">27</xref>], but longer in females than in males in adulthood. However, sex-related differences in LTL have been found to be more difficult to detect in younger adults [<xref rid=""B28-biomedicines-12-01724"" ref-type=""bibr"">28</xref>]. Furthermore, a meta-analysis concluded that only studies using the Southern blot method showed that females have longer telomeres than males [<xref rid=""B29-biomedicines-12-01724"" ref-type=""bibr"">29</xref>]. A recent study showed that LTL were significantly shorter in patients with FD compared to matched healthy controls, mainly due to LTL difference in males [<xref rid=""B21-biomedicines-12-01724"" ref-type=""bibr"">21</xref>]. In our group of patients, with a mean age of 47.3 years, no difference in LTL was found between males and females. We found no difference in LTL between patients receiving DST and those not receiving therapy, which is consistent with a previous study showing that enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) has no effect on telomere attrition [<xref rid=""B21-biomedicines-12-01724"" ref-type=""bibr"">21</xref>]. This may be partly due to the fact that ERT may mitigate disease progression but cannot completely prevent organ damage progression in Fabry patients [<xref rid=""B30-biomedicines-12-01724"" ref-type=""bibr"">30</xref>,<xref rid=""B31-biomedicines-12-01724"" ref-type=""bibr"">31</xref>]. On the other hand, patients who receive DST are typically more severely affected than those who receive no therapy. Therefore, the lack of correlation could also indicate that DST stabilizes LTL. However, further studies are necessary to investigate the effect of DST on LTL dynamics. The association between a short LTL and various conditions has been extensively studied in recent years. However, the results are often contradictory and mostly based on cross-sectional studies [<xref rid=""B32-biomedicines-12-01724"" ref-type=""bibr"">32</xref>]. In our cohort of Fabry patients, we found no significant difference in LTL in relation to the presence of an advanced stage of organ involvement and/or the presence and number of late complications. However, cross-sectional studies alone cannot establish a causal relationship between LTL and clinical outcomes related to ageing, as associations may have originated in childhood or be confounded by non-age-related differences between older and younger cohorts. Therefore, we also conducted a longitudinal analysis in which LTL was measured at least three times over a period of up to 10 years. Our longitudinal study found no statistically significant association between LTL shortening and the presence of an advanced stage of organ involvement and/or presence and number of late complications in Fabry patients. This finding confirms the conclusion of some other previous studies that TL might not be a useful biomarker for age-related risks such as multimorbidity, mortality, cognitive decline, etc. [<xref rid=""B32-biomedicines-12-01724"" ref-type=""bibr"">32</xref>,<xref rid=""B33-biomedicines-12-01724"" ref-type=""bibr"">33</xref>,<xref rid=""B34-biomedicines-12-01724"" ref-type=""bibr"">34</xref>,<xref rid=""B35-biomedicines-12-01724"" ref-type=""bibr"">35</xref>]. In agreement with previous studies, we also found that changes in LTL dynamics during follow-up were impacted by baseline LTL [<xref rid=""B17-biomedicines-12-01724"" ref-type=""bibr"">17</xref>,<xref rid=""B36-biomedicines-12-01724"" ref-type=""bibr"">36</xref>,<xref rid=""B37-biomedicines-12-01724"" ref-type=""bibr"">37</xref>]. It is noteworthy that the rate of LTL shortening is considerably faster during infancy and early childhood than in adulthood. Furthermore, LTL is a heritable trait with a parental effect [<xref rid=""B38-biomedicines-12-01724"" ref-type=""bibr"">38</xref>]. Studies on twins indicate that TL has a heritability of 36–78% [<xref rid=""B39-biomedicines-12-01724"" ref-type=""bibr"">39</xref>,<xref rid=""B40-biomedicines-12-01724"" ref-type=""bibr"">40</xref>]. In general, TL seems to be mainly determined before adulthood, with heritability and early life factors being the most important determinants of LTL throughout the lifespan [<xref rid=""B41-biomedicines-12-01724"" ref-type=""bibr"">41</xref>]. A study of four adult cohorts found that the inter-individual ranking and tracking of TL remained stable over six decades, supporting the idea that the most of telomere variability arises in the early years of life [<xref rid=""B42-biomedicines-12-01724"" ref-type=""bibr"">42</xref>]. Therefore, it is important to conduct further studies in infants and children to understand the role of telomere shortening in age-related diseases. This is particularly important in Fabry patients, as the accumulation of toxic products has already been observed in fetuses [<xref rid=""B43-biomedicines-12-01724"" ref-type=""bibr"">43</xref>]. In individuals with the classic phenotype, the first symptoms usually manifest in early childhood. These symptoms include acroparesthesias, angiokeratomas, cornea verticillata, an/hypohidrosis, gastrointestinal problems, and heat intolerance [<xref rid=""B4-biomedicines-12-01724"" ref-type=""bibr"">4</xref>,<xref rid=""B20-biomedicines-12-01724"" ref-type=""bibr"">20</xref>]. Therefore, LTL may serve as a biomarker of how the disease burden in early life has affected the outcome in adulthood of Fabry patients. While premature ageing in FD might not be directly related to the accelerated TL attrition, other pathophysiological pathways of ageing need to be explored, such as methylation-based epigenetic clocks [<xref rid=""B44-biomedicines-12-01724"" ref-type=""bibr"">44</xref>] or ribosomal DNA-based clocks [<xref rid=""B45-biomedicines-12-01724"" ref-type=""bibr"">45</xref>]. Our study also has some limitations that should be considered when interpreting the results. We measured LTL, which is only a surrogate marker for TL in different tissues. It would be interesting to study TL in the affected organs, but obtaining tissue is invasive, unlike leukocytes, which are readily available. As FD is a rare disease, the number of patients that can be included in the study is quite limited. Our study design also did not allow for assessing the relationship between LTL and mortality risk in Fabry patients, which may be worth investigating in the future. The study also has several strengths, including its prospective design, the first of its kind, and the thorough phenotypic characterization of the patients, who were followed for 5–10 years. Furthermore, the characteristics of the patients included in the cross-sectional and longitudinal design were quite similar, as shown in <xref rid=""biomedicines-12-01724-t001"" ref-type=""table"">Table 1</xref>. All samples were measured in triplicate, and only those with a standard deviation of less than 0.10 were included to minimize measurement error. DNA was isolated using the same protocol and at the same time. This is a crucial point, as the storage and isolation protocol can influence LTL [<xref rid=""B46-biomedicines-12-01724"" ref-type=""bibr"">46</xref>]. Our study shows that telomere shortening has no significant impact on the occurrence of advanced disease stage and/or complications in adult patients with FD. These findings suggest that telomere shortening in adulthood does not have a major impact on disease progression, which is consistent with previous studies emphasizing the importance of determining TL in early childhood. Indirect associations between LTL and disease burden may be more plausible. In addition, DST showed no association with LTL dynamics.",N/A,01 8 2024
Chronic Cough as the First Clinical Sign of Fabry Disease: A Case Report,"Fabry disease (FD) is a rare lysosomal storage disorder caused by mutations in the GLA gene, which lead to a deficiency of the alpha-galactosidase A enzyme. Pulmonary involvement is one of the possible manifestations of FD, but it is often overlooked and is rarely the only clinical presentation. Chronic cough is an uncommon and nonspecific symptom of pulmonary involvement in FD. Here, we report a case of a 46-year-old non-smoker, Caucasian male who presented to a general practitioner with chronic cough without a significant medical history. The patient was referred to our hospital after routine blood tests revealed elevated creatinine levels. As his cousin had end-stage chronic kidney disease due to FD, we performed a fluorometric assay of the alpha-galactosidase A activity in dried blood spots, which showed abnormal results. Eventually, genetic testing revealed a mutation in the GLA gene. As respiratory symptoms persisted during hospitalization, spirometry was performed, revealing an obstructive pattern. Furthermore, bronchoscopy showed nonspecific bronchial inflammation. Additionally, end-stage renal disease and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy were diagnosed. The patient was put on enzyme replacement therapy, and underwent kidney transplantation. Despite all these procedures, we did not observe any improvement in his cough. This case highlights that chronic cough may be an important clue for pulmonary involvement in FD and should prompt further evaluation in patients with other features suggestive of FD. Early diagnosis and treatment are essential for improving the outcome and quality of life in patients with FD.","Fabry disease (FD) is a rare X-linked lysosomal storage disorder caused by mutations in the GLA gene, which encodes the alpha-galactosidase A enzyme. This enzyme is responsible for the degradation of globotriaosylceramide (Gb3) and other glycosphingolipids in various tissues. The deficiency or dysfunction of alpha-galactosidase A leads to the accumulation of Gb3 and other substrates in lysosomes, resulting in cellular dysfunction and organ damage [<xref rid=""REF1"" ref-type=""bibr"">1</xref>,<xref rid=""REF2"" ref-type=""bibr"">2</xref>]. The incidence of FD in White males ranges from 1:17,000 to 1:117,000 [<xref rid=""REF3"" ref-type=""bibr"">3</xref>]. Clinical manifestations of FD can vary widely. Early symptoms, in order of decreasing prevalence, typically include neuropathic pain, hypohidrosis, gastrointestinal disturbances, angiokeratomas, and corneal opacities. As the disease progresses, patients may develop more serious complications, with cardiomyopathy, left ventricular hypertrophy, and arrhythmias being the most frequently observed, followed by renal involvement and stroke. Males typically experience an earlier onset and a more severe disease course compared to females, who exhibit greater phenotypic variability, ranging from asymptomatic to severely affected [<xref rid=""REF4"" ref-type=""bibr"">4</xref>,<xref rid=""REF5"" ref-type=""bibr"">5</xref>]. The onset and severity of symptoms vary depending on the type and location of the GLA mutation, the residual enzyme activity, and other modifying factors [<xref rid=""REF5"" ref-type=""bibr"">5</xref>,<xref rid=""REF6"" ref-type=""bibr"">6</xref>]. FD can present at any age, from childhood to adulthood, and has a wide phenotypic spectrum [<xref rid=""REF7"" ref-type=""bibr"">7</xref>]. There is a classical form and non-classical (or atypical) form of the disease. Atypical FD is characterized by a residual alpha-galactosidase A activity, resulting in a milder clinical phenotype compared to the classical form. This residual enzyme activity often leads to later disease onset, typically in the fourth to sixth decade of life, and manifestations that may be confined to a single organ system. The most commonly reported atypical manifestation is the cardiac variant, although other organ-specific variants exist [<xref rid=""REF2"" ref-type=""bibr"">2</xref>,<xref rid=""REF4"" ref-type=""bibr"">4</xref>]. Pulmonary involvement in FD, as it is less common than other organ manifestations, can be easily overlooked due to its non-specific symptoms and signs [<xref rid=""REF8"" ref-type=""bibr"">8</xref>]. In contrast to other systems, the exact prevalence of pulmonary involvement is not yet fully established and varies between studies [<xref rid=""REF9"" ref-type=""bibr"">9</xref>,<xref rid=""REF10"" ref-type=""bibr"">10</xref>]. The most common pulmonary finding in FD is obstructive lung disease with possible presence of restrictive lung disease and interstitial lung disease in later stages of the disease [<xref rid=""REF9"" ref-type=""bibr"">9</xref>]. Chronic cough in the absence of any other symptoms of FD is an uncommon clinical phenomenon. It may be related to Gb3 accumulation in airway epithelium, smooth muscle cells, and pulmonary arterioles, causing inflammation and fibrosis [<xref rid=""REF11"" ref-type=""bibr"">11</xref>-<xref rid=""REF14"" ref-type=""bibr"">14</xref>]. A definitive diagnosis of FD relies on demonstrating a low alpha-galactosidase A enzyme activity in white blood cells or blood plasma. When it is not possible to access enzyme testing or genetic analysis, a skin or kidney biopsy can be used to identify the disease. The biopsy would reveal characteristic glycolipid deposits within the tissue. When examining a kidney biopsy under an electron microscope, one can identify distinctive concentric layers of inclusions, also known as zebra bodies [<xref rid=""REF3"" ref-type=""bibr"">3</xref>]. The treatment of FD should involve enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) in conjunction with additional therapies that target the symptoms resulting from tissue damage and aim to prevent further, non-specific tissue injury. Currently, two forms of ERT exist for FD: agalsidase alfa and agalsidase beta. Recommendations regarding when to initiate ERT in pediatric and adult patients with Fabry disease have been published, but it is important to note that treatment should only be initiated after a definitive diagnosis of the disease has been confirmed [<xref rid=""REF6"" ref-type=""bibr"">6</xref>,<xref rid=""REF15"" ref-type=""bibr"">15</xref>]. We report a case of a 46-year-old Caucasian male who presented with chronic cough of several years as the sole reported clinical symptom. He had no history of smoking, asthma, gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), allergies or respiratory infections. He denied any chest pain, shortness of breath, or wheezing. He reported no unintentional weight loss, fever, or night sweats, and his past medical history was uneventful. He worked as a farmer, with no known relevant environmental exposures, and was not taking any medications. Laboratory tests showed a markedly elevated creatinine level (5.87 mg/dL). Additionally, the patient’s family history was significant for FD; his male cousin on the mother’s side was diagnosed with FD, at age of 17, progressing to end-stage chronic kidney disease (CKD) and ultimately undergoing a kidney transplant (Figure <xref rid=""FIG1"" ref-type=""fig"">1</xref>). The patient was referred to our hospital for further evaluation. On admission, the patient’s physical examination was normal, except for a high blood pressure of 176/100 mmHg. Abdominal ultrasonography was performed and revealed small kidneys with thinning of the parenchyma and increased echogenicity. Moreover, the differentiation between the renal cortex and medulla was poor. A cyst measuring 9 mm in diameter was observed in the left kidney, but there were no other focal lesions. No abnormalities were detected in other abdominal organs. His laboratory test results are shown in Table <xref rid=""TAB1"" ref-type=""table"">1</xref>. Other parameters were in the normal ranges. Due to unknown etiology of CKD and a high suspicion of FD, a fluorometric assay of the alpha-galactosidase A activity in dried blood spots (DBS) was carried out, which showed no activity of the enzyme (0.0 umol/l/h; cut-off value: >2.8 umol/l/h). This test confirmed the diagnosis of FD; furthermore, genetic testing revealed c.520T>C (p.Cys174Arg) mutation in the GLA gene. As the renal failure was consistent with organ involvement in FD, a kidney biopsy was waived. In a thorough interview focused on FD symptoms, the patient reported recurrent acroparesthesia with burning sensations in his hands that occurred only during febrile infections. The symptom relented with fever and had never occurred without fever. That finding is very characteristic and stays in accordance with some reports in the literature [<xref rid=""REF16"" ref-type=""bibr"">16</xref>]. The patient underwent further investigations to assess the extent of other organs' involvement in FD. Holter ECG revealed ST-segment depressions, deep inverted T waves, a tendency toward bradycardia and a shortened PQ interval, which is a characteristic feature of ECG in FD patients (Figure <xref rid=""FIG2"" ref-type=""fig"">2</xref>). Echocardiography showed concentric left-ventricular hypertrophy, which is consistent with FD cardiomyopathy [<xref rid=""REF17"" ref-type=""bibr"">17</xref>]. Brain magnetic resonance imaging revealed ischemic lesions consistent with FD. However, the neurological examination showed no significant abnormalities. The pulmonary function was evaluated using spirometry, revealing evidence of irreversible obstruction, characterized by a forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) of 2.44 l, a forced vital capacity (FVC) of 4.09 l, and an FEV1/FVC ratio of 60%. His chest X-ray was normal, with no signs of infection, congestion, or fibrosis. High-resolution computed tomography showed peribronchial ground-glass opacities and tree-in-bud sign in second and third right lung segments with a possible inflammatory origin. There were also signs of basal bilateral pulmonary fibrosis (Figure <xref rid=""FIG3"" ref-type=""fig"">3</xref>). Diagnostic bronchoscopy was performed and showed signs of chronic bronchial inflammation. A bronchoaspirate sample was collected, and subsequent bacterial cultures, along with <italic toggle=""yes"">Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic>-specific PCR analysis, did not reveal any evidence of infection. Based on the history (no atopy, allergies, smoking, or medication use), physical examination, imaging (chest X-ray and CT scan), laboratory studies (normal inflammatory markers and negative bacterial cultures from bronchoaspirate), and additional tests (normal endoscopy), we were able to rule out the most common causes of chronic cough, including infection, asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, cancer, medication side effects, GERD and interstitial lung disease. We decided to further examine bronchial tissues (aquired during bronchoscopy) via electron microscopy. This test revealed the presence of zebra-like cytoplasmic inclusions in the bronchial epithelium and pulmonary capillaries endothelium, typical for FD. These examinations were conducted at an external clinic, and despite our efforts, we have been unable to obtain the original results. The patient started enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) with agalsidase alfa (Replagal) at a dose of 0.2 mg/kg every other week within a month of arriving at our hospital. As a part of a standard procedure for patients that receive ERT in our clinic, the patient had a central venous catheter implanted. Due to the progressive CKD, peritoneal dialysis was introduced. He subsequently underwent a renal transplant in 2022. After one year, the transplanted kidney remained fully functional. Following the patient's diagnosis and subsequent family screening, his daughter was also found to have FD, and currently receives ERT after initially presenting with acroparesthesia in the feet. The patient's sister also has FD, but details regarding her disease course and its presentation are unavailable. His chronic cough did not improve, and to this day, he continues to report cough as his most bothersome symptom. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first case report of a patient with FD who presented with chronic cough as the first and only reported clinical symptom. While cough has been documented in FD, those cases typically presented with other FD-related symptoms or known comorbidities. For instance, Wang et al. described a 47-year-old woman with FD who developed a dry, non-productive cough, but she had a prior diagnosis of Fabry disease and a history of cerebrovascular events [<xref rid=""REF12"" ref-type=""bibr"">12</xref>]. FD is known for its atypical manifestations, affecting a wide range of organs, including the skin, kidneys, heart, lungs, and nervous system. This diversity in organ involvement can lead to misdiagnosis, such as systemic connective tissue diseases or systemic vasculitis [<xref rid=""REF18"" ref-type=""bibr"">18</xref>,<xref rid=""REF19"" ref-type=""bibr"">19</xref>]. However, FD can initially present with symptoms related to just one organ system, which is seen, for example, in the late-onset variant of FD [<xref rid=""REF20"" ref-type=""bibr"">20</xref>]. There is emerging data on pulmonary involvement in lysosomal storage disorders [<xref rid=""REF10"" ref-type=""bibr"">10</xref>]; however, in FD, it is often overlooked or misdiagnosed and is rarely the only clinical presentation [<xref rid=""REF21"" ref-type=""bibr"">21</xref>]. According to one study, FD exhibits bronchial obstruction in 46% of cases, coupled with an annual average decline of 29 ml in FEV1 [<xref rid=""REF2"" ref-type=""bibr"">2</xref>]. Additionally, a separate investigation revealed that the rate of lung function decline was significantly accelerated in male patients, particularly in those undergoing ERT [<xref rid=""REF22"" ref-type=""bibr"">22</xref>]. The pathophysiology of chronic cough in FD is not fully understood, but it may be related to the accumulation of Gb3 in the respiratory epithelium and smooth muscle cells. This may lead to an increased production of pro-inflammatory cytokines, chemokines, and growth factors, which may induce airway inflammation, bronchospasm, fibrosis, and remodeling [<xref rid=""REF23"" ref-type=""bibr"">23</xref>,<xref rid=""REF24"" ref-type=""bibr"">24</xref>]. The presence of zebra-like bodies in the bronchial epithelium of our patient may in fact be a source of chronic cough in this case. The treatment of FD consists of ERT, which aims to replace the deficient enzyme and reduce the accumulation of Gb3 [<xref rid=""REF6"" ref-type=""bibr"">6</xref>]. There is evidence that the initiation of ERT can stop Gb3 accumulation in tissues [<xref rid=""REF25"" ref-type=""bibr"">25</xref>] and slow down the progression of the disease, especially when treatment is introduced early [<xref rid=""REF26"" ref-type=""bibr"">26</xref>]. The delay in diagnosis in our patient led to the development of CKD, which eventually required a kidney transplant. This could potentially have been avoided if ERT was administered earlier. It is worth mentioning here that FD is not a contraindication to organ transplantation [<xref rid=""REF27"" ref-type=""bibr"">27</xref>]. The effect of ERT on pulmonary involvement and chronic cough in FD remains unclear [<xref rid=""REF21"" ref-type=""bibr"">21</xref>]. Several studies have yielded conflicting results regarding the impact of ERT on pulmonary function [<xref rid=""REF22"" ref-type=""bibr"">22</xref>,<xref rid=""REF28"" ref-type=""bibr"">28</xref>,<xref rid=""REF29"" ref-type=""bibr"">29</xref>]. In our case, the patient did not experience any improvement in his cough after ERT. This could be attributed to the delayed initiation of ERT and the presence of an irreversible lung damage. Our case illustrates that chronic cough may be a sign of pulmonary involvement in FD. It may appear as the first clinical manifestation reported by the patient in the absence of other typical FD symptoms. Its presence paired with unexplained renal impairment or a positive family history should prompt further diagnostic workup for FD. Early diagnosis and intervention are crucial in improving the long-term outcomes and quality of life of individuals with FD.",N/A,30 7 2024
"Inflammation, Oxidative Stress, and Endothelial Dysfunction in the Pathogenesis of Vascular Damage: Unraveling Novel Cardiovascular Risk Factors in Fabry Disease","Anderson-Fabry disease (AFD), a genetic disorder caused by mutations in the α-galactosidase-A <italic toggle=""yes"">(GLA)</italic> gene, disrupts lysosomal function, leading to vascular complications. The accumulation of globotriaosylceramide (Gb3) in arterial walls triggers upregulation of adhesion molecules, decreases endothelial nitric oxide synthesis, and induces reactive oxygen species production. This cascade results in fibrotic thickening, endothelial dysfunction, hypercontractility, vasospasm, and a pro-thrombotic phenotype. AFD patients display increased intima-media thickness (IMT) and reduced flow-mediated dilation (FMD), indicating heightened cardiovascular risk. Nailfold capillaroscopy (NFC) shows promise in diagnosing and monitoring microcirculatory disorders in AFD, though it remains underexplored. Morphological evidence of AFD as a storage disorder can be demonstrated through electron microscopy and immunodetection of Gb3. Secondary pathophysiological disturbances at cellular, tissue, and organ levels contribute to the clinical manifestations, with prominent lysosomal inclusions observed in vascular, cardiac, renal, and neuronal cells. Chronic accumulation of Gb3 represents a state of ongoing toxicity, leading to increased cell turnover, particularly in vascular endothelial cells. AFD-related vascular pathology includes increased renin-angiotensin system activation, endothelial dysfunction, and smooth muscle cell proliferation, resulting in IMT increase. Furthermore, microvascular alterations, such as atypical capillaries observed through NFC, suggest early microvascular involvement. This review aims to unravel the complex interplay between inflammation, oxidative stress, and endothelial dysfunction in AFD, highlighting the potential connections between metabolic disturbances, oxidative stress, inflammation, and fibrosis in vascular and cardiac complications. By exploring novel cardiovascular risk factors and potential diagnostic tools, we can advance our understanding of these mechanisms, which extend beyond sphingolipid accumulation to include other significant contributors to disease pathogenesis. This comprehensive approach can pave the way for innovative therapeutic strategies and improved patient outcomes.","Anderson-Fabry disease (AFD) is an X-linked lysosomal storage disorder caused by pathogenic variants in the α-galactosidase A gene (α-GAL-A, <italic toggle=""yes"">GLA</italic> gene), resulting in reduced or absent lysosomal enzyme activity and impaired lysosomal function [<xref rid=""B1-ijms-25-08273"" ref-type=""bibr"">1</xref>]. It is a monogenic, X-linked recessive hereditary disease with an estimated birth prevalence of 1:40,000–117,000 [<xref rid=""B2-ijms-25-08273"" ref-type=""bibr"">2</xref>,<xref rid=""B3-ijms-25-08273"" ref-type=""bibr"">3</xref>]. Hemizygous males typically exhibit full disease features due to almost zero or markedly reduced α-galactosidase A activity, presenting with neurological, dermatological, renal, cardiovascular, cochleo-vestibular, and cerebrovascular symptoms. Heterozygous females can have variable expressivity, ranging from very mild to severe [<xref rid=""B1-ijms-25-08273"" ref-type=""bibr"">1</xref>,<xref rid=""B4-ijms-25-08273"" ref-type=""bibr"">4</xref>]. Once considered mere carriers, they actually exhibit a broad spectrum of disease manifestations due to lyonization, leading to cellular mosaicism [<xref rid=""B5-ijms-25-08273"" ref-type=""bibr"">5</xref>]. X-chromosome inactivation occurs randomly in females, balancing gene dosage between females with two X chromosomes and males with one. Females expressing the wild-type X chromosome allele may have few symptoms, while those expressing the mutated allele can exhibit severe disease like hemizygous males [<xref rid=""B6-ijms-25-08273"" ref-type=""bibr"">6</xref>,<xref rid=""B7-ijms-25-08273"" ref-type=""bibr"">7</xref>]. AFD is a multisystemic disorder that begins with cellular dysfunction, followed by a cascade of functional impairment in various organs and culminating in structural damage that progresses over years or even decades, leading to late complications and renal, cardiac, or cerebrovascular failure. The progressive organ damage is closely linked to the involvement of vascular endothelial and smooth muscle cells, particularly in the microcirculation, pericytes, cardiomyocytes, various epithelial cells in the kidney, and neuronal cell types in the central and peripheral nervous systems [<xref rid=""B4-ijms-25-08273"" ref-type=""bibr"">4</xref>,<xref rid=""B8-ijms-25-08273"" ref-type=""bibr"">8</xref>]. The accumulation of metabolites may trigger secondary pathological processes, including inflammation, ischemia, hypertrophy, and fibrosis [<xref rid=""B9-ijms-25-08273"" ref-type=""bibr"">9</xref>,<xref rid=""B10-ijms-25-08273"" ref-type=""bibr"">10</xref>]. There is significant inter- and intrafamilial variability in the age of onset, clinical features, and disease progression [<xref rid=""B5-ijms-25-08273"" ref-type=""bibr"">5</xref>]. The primary pathological process begins in childhood or even fetal development [<xref rid=""B11-ijms-25-08273"" ref-type=""bibr"">11</xref>]. However, unlike many other lysosomal storage diseases, most patients remain clinically asymptomatic in the early years [<xref rid=""B12-ijms-25-08273"" ref-type=""bibr"">12</xref>].  AFD can be demonstrated as a storage disorder through electron microscopy of affected tissues and specific in situ immunodetection of Gb3 using monoclonal antibodies [<xref rid=""B8-ijms-25-08273"" ref-type=""bibr"">8</xref>]. While Gb3 accumulation is the primary pathogenic event, the subsequent secondary disturbances at cellular, tissue, and organ levels that lead to clinical manifestations are not fully understood [<xref rid=""B4-ijms-25-08273"" ref-type=""bibr"">4</xref>,<xref rid=""B38-ijms-25-08273"" ref-type=""bibr"">38</xref>]. Significant abnormalities include lysosomal inclusions or lipid deposits in various cell types, prominently in vascular endothelial and smooth muscle cells, cardiac cells, renal epithelial cells, and nerve cells, including dorsal root ganglia and some central nervous system neurons [<xref rid=""B38-ijms-25-08273"" ref-type=""bibr"">38</xref>]. Chronic Gb3 accumulation prompts a state of chronic toxicity. Although there is no evidence of massive cell death, increased turnover of certain cells, such as vascular endothelial cells, is likely. AFD is indeed largely a systemic vascular disease-causing cardiovascular complications and cerebral ischemia. Several mechanisms contribute to ischemic tissue damage, including occlusion and luminal obstruction due to Gb3 accumulation in vascular endothelial cells, disruption of the balance between vasodilators and vasoconstrictors, and thromboembolic complications [<xref rid=""B39-ijms-25-08273"" ref-type=""bibr"">39</xref>]. Early peripheral neuropathy reflects functional deterioration of neuronal cells in the autonomic and somatosensory peripheral nervous systems due to Gb3 deposits in the vasa vasorum of small myelinated and unmyelinated fibers. Numerous studies have demonstrated cerebral circulation dysfunction in Fabry patients, particularly significant hyperperfusion in the posterior cerebral circulation [<xref rid=""B40-ijms-25-08273"" ref-type=""bibr"">40</xref>]. This hyperperfusion is not ubiquitous, suggesting heterogeneity in response to glycolipid accumulation in different vascular beds. Calcifications indicating end-stage organ damage are demonstrable in hyperperfused brain regions such as white matter and posterior thalamic regions [<xref rid=""B41-ijms-25-08273"" ref-type=""bibr"">41</xref>]. Hypohidrosis is a sign of selective damage to peripheral nerves [<xref rid=""B42-ijms-25-08273"" ref-type=""bibr"">42</xref>], although it has also been attributed to lipid deposits in small vessels surrounding sweat glands. Vascular skin lesions (angiokeratomas) are caused by the weakening of capillary walls due to the accumulation of Gb3 and the development of vascular ectasias in the dermis and epidermis. Early gastrointestinal manifestations are due to Gb3 accumulation in the vascular endothelium of mesenteric blood vessels, unmyelinated neurons, perineural cells, and autonomic ganglia in the gastrointestinal tract [<xref rid=""B43-ijms-25-08273"" ref-type=""bibr"">43</xref>]. The pathogenesis of the disease in the heart and kidneys is not well understood. The characteristic hypertrophic cardiomyopathy of AFD is associated with increased (IMT)-media thickness, like that observed in common cardiovascular diseases. In Fabry patients’ plasma, there is an increased proliferative response of vascular smooth muscle cells (SMCs) in culture compared with control plasma, suggesting that a circulating factor is partly responsible for cardiac hypertrophy in this disease [<xref rid=""B44-ijms-25-08273"" ref-type=""bibr"">44</xref>], a phenomenon similar to that observed in vascular endothelial cells [<xref rid=""B45-ijms-25-08273"" ref-type=""bibr"">45</xref>]. About the mechanism of renal failure in AFD, beyond the accumulation of material, pathological alterations and the presence of progressive glomerulosclerosis and proteinuria resemble other proteinuric nephropathies, such as those occurring in diabetes mellitus [<xref rid=""B46-ijms-25-08273"" ref-type=""bibr"">46</xref>]. Fabry proteinuria does not respond to enzyme replacement infusions, but if the analogy with diabetes is correct, it may be associated with overexpression of cathepsin-L, as well as altered dynamin processing, and thus may be reversible with appropriate treatment [<xref rid=""B47-ijms-25-08273"" ref-type=""bibr"">47</xref>].  Recent advances in understanding AFD have underscored inflammation’s critical role in its pathogenesis and the significance of novel biomarkers for tracking disease progression (<xref rid=""ijms-25-08273-t002"" ref-type=""table"">Table 2</xref>). These discoveries offer insights into AFD’s mechanisms and open avenues for improved diagnosis and treatment. A promoter polymorphism (−174G > C) of the IL-6 gene is linked to the Mainz Severity Score Index (MSSI) in AFD patients, with the IL-6 C allele influencing MSSI, especially in females [<xref rid=""B149-ijms-25-08273"" ref-type=""bibr"">149</xref>]. Chronic inflammation in AFD is driven by glycolipids like Gb3 and lyso-Gb3, which interact with TLRs, triggering inflammation and fibrosis in organs such as the kidneys and heart [<xref rid=""B77-ijms-25-08273"" ref-type=""bibr"">77</xref>]. Cultured PBMC from AFD patients show heightened pro-inflammatory cytokine production, with Gb3 likely mediating this via TLR4. Invariant natural killer T (iNKT) cells exhibit a pro-inflammatory phenotype in AFD [<xref rid=""B73-ijms-25-08273"" ref-type=""bibr"">73</xref>,<xref rid=""B150-ijms-25-08273"" ref-type=""bibr"">150</xref>]. Proteomic analyses have identified up-regulated proteins such as γ-enolase and galectin-1 in AFD patients, highlighting their potential as biomarkers [<xref rid=""B151-ijms-25-08273"" ref-type=""bibr"">151</xref>]. Elevated serum C-reactive protein levels before stroke onset link persistent inflammation to recurrent strokes in AFD patients [<xref rid=""B152-ijms-25-08273"" ref-type=""bibr"">152</xref>]. Elevated levels of inflammatory markers like TNF, TNFR2, IL-6, and MMP-2 in AFD patients with left ventricular hypertrophy and increased BNP, MR-proANP, MMP-2, and galectin levels in renal dysfunction, correlate with disease progression [<xref rid=""B116-ijms-25-08273"" ref-type=""bibr"">116</xref>]. Complement activation products C3a and C5a are increased in AFD patients with anti-drug antibodies, and elevated IL-6, IL-10, and TGF-β1 levels suggest complement activation’s role in renal damage [<xref rid=""B153-ijms-25-08273"" ref-type=""bibr"">153</xref>]. Traditional biomarkers like serum creatinine and proteinuria are limited in monitoring AFD, while elevated serum GDF-15 (Growth/differentiation factor 15) and syndecan-1 levels in patients with cardiomyopathy and nephropathy indicate potential associations with fibrosis and clinical outcomes, making them helpful biomarkers to identify classic AFD patients with cardiac and renal involvement. Elevated syndecan-1 levels are linked to conditions such as ischemic heart disease, acute heart failure, lupus nephritis, and chronic and acute kidney injury. Additionally, GDF-15 is induced in response to injury and is associated with cardiovascular damage and CKD. GDF-15 also plays a protective role against tissue injury by inhibiting myocardial hypertrophy and fibrosis [<xref rid=""B154-ijms-25-08273"" ref-type=""bibr"">154</xref>]. Myocardial inflammation of autoimmune origin in AFD cardiomyopathy, with circulating anti-Gb3 antibodies as biomarkers, has been identified [<xref rid=""B155-ijms-25-08273"" ref-type=""bibr"">155</xref>]. Elevated serum IL-6 and TNF-α levels in AFD patients treated with ERT correlate with MSSI scores, indicating a greater disease burden [<xref rid=""B156-ijms-25-08273"" ref-type=""bibr"">156</xref>]. Both AFD and hypertension activate the innate immune system, with TLR4 as a common trigger, and the renin-angiotensin system contributes to chronic inflammation and oxidative imbalance, suggesting potential targeted therapies [<xref rid=""B97-ijms-25-08273"" ref-type=""bibr"">97</xref>]. Gb3 accumulation causes lysosomal dysfunction, affecting the lysosome-autophagy-mitochondria interaction, which is crucial for organ damage in AFD [<xref rid=""B157-ijms-25-08273"" ref-type=""bibr"">157</xref>]. Gb3 deposition in cardiomyocytes increases cardiac excitability by altering calcium activity [<xref rid=""B158-ijms-25-08273"" ref-type=""bibr"">158</xref>,<xref rid=""B159-ijms-25-08273"" ref-type=""bibr"">159</xref>]. The mTOR (mammalian Target Of Rapamycin) pathway is critical for regulating mitochondrial metabolism and autophagy [<xref rid=""B160-ijms-25-08273"" ref-type=""bibr"">160</xref>,<xref rid=""B161-ijms-25-08273"" ref-type=""bibr"">161</xref>]. Dysregulation of this pathway inhibits mitochondrial metabolism in AFD cells. Biomarkers such as symmetric dimethylarginine (SDMA), l-arginine, asymmetric dimethylarginine (ADMA), and l-homoarginine (hArg) reflect extracellular matrix turnover and endothelial dysfunction in AFD patients [<xref rid=""B72-ijms-25-08273"" ref-type=""bibr"">72</xref>]. Lyso-Gb3 inhibits NO synthase, contributing to vasculopathy and cardiac symptoms, which are mitigated by paricalcitol or calcitriol [<xref rid=""B62-ijms-25-08273"" ref-type=""bibr"">62</xref>,<xref rid=""B162-ijms-25-08273"" ref-type=""bibr"">162</xref>]. Complement pathway interactions and elevated microRNAs (miRNAs) suggest their role as biomarkers for AFD [<xref rid=""B163-ijms-25-08273"" ref-type=""bibr"">163</xref>]. Incorporating these markers into clinical practice could enhance diagnostic accuracy, especially in asymptomatic or early-stage patients [<xref rid=""B109-ijms-25-08273"" ref-type=""bibr"">109</xref>]. Elevated levels of TGF-β1, α-TGF, FGF2, and VEGF-A in AFD correlate with myocardial fibrosis and adverse cardiovascular events, serving as prognostic indicators [<xref rid=""B29-ijms-25-08273"" ref-type=""bibr"">29</xref>]. Elevated 3-nitrotyrosine (3-NT) levels may serve as biomarkers for vascular involvement and treatment response [<xref rid=""B109-ijms-25-08273"" ref-type=""bibr"">109</xref>]. Emerging serum biomarkers like MMP-9, angiostatin, SDMA(symmetric dimethylarginine), and the hArg/SDMA ratio indicate extracellular matrix turnover and endothelial dysfunction [<xref rid=""B82-ijms-25-08273"" ref-type=""bibr"">82</xref>]. These findings highlight inflammation’s significant role in AFD pathogenesis and the potential of novel biomarkers to enhance disease monitoring and therapeutic strategies. By targeting inflammatory pathways, outcomes for AFD patients may improve. Monitoring cardiac remodeling and systemic inflammation markers could provide increased sensitivity for early detection, aiding the timely initiation of ERT to prevent complications [<xref rid=""B164-ijms-25-08273"" ref-type=""bibr"">164</xref>]. The detailed mechanisms and consequences of inflammatory responses in AFD remain incompletely understood. The therapeutic strategy targeting inflammation is highly demanding and appealing [<xref rid=""B165-ijms-25-08273"" ref-type=""bibr"">165</xref>].  AFD management remains challenging despite advancements in ERT. While ERT has demonstrated efficacy in improving organ function, it requires biweekly intravenous administration, which poses risks such as immunogenicity that can ultimately reduce its effectiveness [<xref rid=""B166-ijms-25-08273"" ref-type=""bibr"">166</xref>]. Anti-drug antibodies often develop within three to six months after starting ERT, predominantly affecting males with classic AFD. These antibodies can bind to the therapeutic enzyme, leading to its inactivation and reduced cellular uptake, thus diminishing ERT efficacy and worsening clinical outcomes [<xref rid=""B166-ijms-25-08273"" ref-type=""bibr"">166</xref>,<xref rid=""B167-ijms-25-08273"" ref-type=""bibr"">167</xref>]. Strategies to mitigate these effects, such as increasing ERT dosage and using immunosuppressive therapies, have shown varied long-term effects and potential side effects [<xref rid=""B167-ijms-25-08273"" ref-type=""bibr"">167</xref>] (NCT03614234).  Despite these challenges, significant progress is being made in developing new therapeutic approaches for Fabry disease. Ongoing research and clinical trials are focused on more effective and less burdensome treatments, including oral therapies, novel ERT formulations, gene therapy, and substrate reduction therapy (SRT).  One promising oral therapy is migalastat, a pharmacological chaperone that stabilizes the α-GalA enzyme, facilitating its proper trafficking and function. Clinical trials such as FACETS and ATTRACT [<xref rid=""B37-ijms-25-08273"" ref-type=""bibr"">37</xref>,<xref rid=""B168-ijms-25-08273"" ref-type=""bibr"">168</xref>] have demonstrated its efficacy in reducing left ventricular mass index and stabilizing eGFR. Substrate reduction therapies are another exciting area of research. Drugs like lucerastat and venglustat inhibit glycosphingolipid synthesis, aiming to reduce Gb3 accumulation in tissues. These therapies are being tested for their potential to modify the disease course and improve symptoms, offering a new avenue for patients with non-classical mutations or those who could benefit from a combined approach with ERT (MODIFY trial, NCT03425539; NCT0528054; NCT05206773). Lucerastat, an orally active glucosylceramide synthase (GCS) inhibitor, aims to restore enzyme activity without intravenous administration by blocking the synthesis of a precursor molecule of Gb3. Phase 1 trial results (NCT02930655) showed lucerastat was well tolerated and significantly reduced blood levels of Gb3 and related fatty molecules compared with ERT alone, though no effects were observed on kidney or heart function. Most participants opted to continue in an open-label extension study (NCT03737214), where interim results for up to two years showed maintained reductions in Gb3. While kidney function had been declining in participants before entering MODIFY, data from the Phase 3 trial and its extension study showed lucerastat associated with slower declines compared with a placebo and historical data. Improvements in cardiac health measures were also observed, including a decrease in the left ventricular mass index, a predictor of cardiovascular disease. Venglustat, another SRT, is being evaluated in the CARAT trial (NCT05280548) for its effect versus standard therapy on left ventricular mass at CMR and organ damage in Fabry disease patients with LVH.  AL01211, an investigational therapy, has shown promise in Phase 1 trials by safely lowering levels of Gb3 in healthy adults. This oral treatment is currently in a Phase 2 trial (NCT06114329) involving men with classic Fabry disease who have never used a disease-related treatment. AL01211 aims to maximize its effects on targeted organs and minimize side effects on the brain by avoiding the central nervous system. In addition to oral therapies, new formulations of ERT are being explored. Pegunigalsidase alfa, a PEGylated ERT, has shown sustained plasma concentrations and efficacy in reducing plasma lyso-Gb3 and its deposition in the kidney (slowing eGFR slope and proteinuria) and in the left ventricle, potentially offering a less immunogenic alternative to current ERT options, as PEGylation could mask some epitopes from the immune system, reverse anti-drug antibodies, and induce immune tolerance [<xref rid=""B169-ijms-25-08273"" ref-type=""bibr"">169</xref>,<xref rid=""B170-ijms-25-08273"" ref-type=""bibr"">170</xref>,<xref rid=""B171-ijms-25-08273"" ref-type=""bibr"">171</xref>,<xref rid=""B172-ijms-25-08273"" ref-type=""bibr"">172</xref>]. Ongoing clinical trials (NCT03614234, NCT06095713, NCT05710692, and NCT03566017) will evaluate its efficacy and safety in the real world compared with previously approved ERTs. Another innovative approach involves a plant-based ERT derived from Phycomitrella patens, designed to elude immunogenic responses, that has been shown to reduce urinary Gb3 levels [<xref rid=""B173-ijms-25-08273"" ref-type=""bibr"">173</xref>,<xref rid=""B174-ijms-25-08273"" ref-type=""bibr"">174</xref>]. Gene therapy holds significant promise for Fabry disease, with several approaches under investigation. One method uses adeno-associated virus (AAV) vectors for one-time intravenous administration to deliver the GLA gene to hepatocytes, enabling endogenous enzyme production and secretion. Clinical trials (NCT06270316, NCT04519749, STAAR—NCT04046224) are exploring the safety and efficacy of these therapies. Another approach involves lentivirus-mediated gene therapy, using lentivirus-transduced hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells to express α-galactosidase A. Early results are promising, showing increased enzyme activity and reduced Gb3 and lyso-Gb3 levels (NCT02800070). Additionally, mRNA therapy, encapsulating GLA mRNA in lipid nanoparticles, has shown potential in preclinical studies to increase enzyme levels in the liver, heart, and kidneys. Moreover, combination therapies and novel administration protocols are being investigated to enhance the effectiveness of current treatments. The SHORTEN study (NCT06019728) aims to optimize ERT infusion protocols to reduce treatment burden by increasing the infusion rate and reducing infusion volume. The RECAFTURE trial (NCT02469181) evaluates the impact of ERT on cardiac function using advanced imaging techniques to understand its effects on left ventricular diastolic function and flow. Other ongoing trials in Fabry disease focus on the role of inflammation in diagnosis and its correlation with imaging. The study NCT06226987 combines PET and CMR to identify myocardial inflammation, distinguishing between edema and fibrosis. The Bio-FAIR trial (NCT06007768) examines immune response biomarkers and their relationship with disease severity, quality of life, and pain in patients. The study NCT05698901 aims to develop an algorithm using biomarkers to evaluate disease progression and treatment response. Lastly, the FASHION study (NCT05761834) explores differences in inflammatory profiles between Fabry disease and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, analyzing correlations between inflammatory phenotypes and cardiac severity through proteomic and transcriptomic analyses, echocardiography, and electrocardiography. The future of Fabry disease treatment looks promising, with these innovative approaches potentially improving patient outcomes and quality of life. Future research should focus on more comprehensive and effective management of lysosomal storage disorders, including AFD, by addressing the interplay of metabolic dysfunction, oxidative stress, and inflammation inherent to the disease [<xref rid=""B175-ijms-25-08273"" ref-type=""bibr"">175</xref>]. This includes targeting mitochondrial functions and integrating antioxidant therapies with existing treatments. For example, coenzyme Q10 treatment, involved in ROS scavenging and mitochondrial ATP production, has been reported to alleviate mitochondrial dysfunction and reduce ROS production in Gaucher macrophages and NP-C patient-derived fibroblasts [<xref rid=""B176-ijms-25-08273"" ref-type=""bibr"">176</xref>]. Antioxidants such as N-acetylcysteine are known to normalize pro-inflammatory cytokine production in Niemann-Pick disease type C fibroblasts, potentially through restoring trafficking and mitigating oxidative stress [<xref rid=""B177-ijms-25-08273"" ref-type=""bibr"">177</xref>]. The antioxidant Glutathione has demonstrated effectiveness in attenuating oxidative stress in renal AFD in vitro models [<xref rid=""B90-ijms-25-08273"" ref-type=""bibr"">90</xref>], while ascorbate supplementation has been found to decrease cerebral hyperperfusion in AFD patients undergoing ERT. The effect of ERT can be enhanced with adjunct antioxidants like vitamin E and ticlopidine, suggesting a multi-pronged approach may benefit AFD patients [<xref rid=""B178-ijms-25-08273"" ref-type=""bibr"">178</xref>,<xref rid=""B179-ijms-25-08273"" ref-type=""bibr"">179</xref>]. Exosomes represent a novel approach, both as biomarkers and therapeutic vehicles. They are signaling vehicles that mediate inflammatory processes and deliver therapeutic proteins effectively. Exosomes loaded with cytokines become biologically active upon interaction with target cells, such as macrophages, revealing a pro-inflammatory action [<xref rid=""B180-ijms-25-08273"" ref-type=""bibr"">180</xref>]. In vitro and in vivo studies showed that Extracellular Vesicles carrying GLA (EV-GLA) were rapidly taken up and driven directly to lysosomes, restoring enzyme functionality more efficiently than clinical-reference agalsidase-alfa [<xref rid=""B181-ijms-25-08273"" ref-type=""bibr"">181</xref>]. This represents a crucial advantage over ERT, which fails to access the brain [<xref rid=""B182-ijms-25-08273"" ref-type=""bibr"">182</xref>]. Personalized medicine, integrating these advanced therapies tailored to individual disease profiles, represents a promising direction for the comprehensive management of AFD and other lysosomal storage disorders. This approach aims to address the interplay of metabolic dysfunction, oxidative stress, and inflammation inherent to the disease, potentially revolutionizing patient care [<xref rid=""B165-ijms-25-08273"" ref-type=""bibr"">165</xref>,<xref rid=""B175-ijms-25-08273"" ref-type=""bibr"">175</xref>]. AFD is a complex lysosomal storage disorder characterized by glycosphingolipid accumulation that leads to multi-organ damage. This review underscores the critical roles of oxidative stress, endothelial dysfunction, and inflammation in the disease’s pathogenesis. Elevated levels of advanced oxidation products and diminished antioxidant defenses contribute significantly to vascular and organ damage. Endothelial dysfunction arises from the intricate interplay of inflammatory pathways, including the TGF-β, NF-κB, and renin-angiotensin systems, which promote fibrosis and impair vascular function. Understanding the inflammatory pathways and mechanisms in AFD, along with the identification of novel inflammatory biomarkers and the application of advanced imaging techniques, offers new insights for developing personalized therapeutic approaches. These advancements suggest potential strategies that extend beyond ERT, providing opportunities for more effective early interventions in the disease’s pathophysiology. The incorporation of biomarkers such as γ-enolase, galectin-1, and microRNAs, combined with cutting-edge imaging modalities, facilitates early diagnosis and precise monitoring of disease progression. Emerging therapies show promise in stabilizing disease progression, while gene therapy and substrate reduction therapy represent potential future directions for long-term management. Targeting mitochondrial dysfunction and integrating antioxidant therapies offer promising avenues for mitigating oxidative damage and improving patient outcomes. A deeper knowledge of AFD’s inflammatory mechanisms represents an exciting and evolving field. This comprehensive approach, leveraging early intervention and personalized medicine, holds the potential to significantly advance the effectiveness of treatments and improve clinical outcomes for patients with AFD. Further research in this domain is essential to fully elucidate these pathways and translate these insights into therapeutic innovations.",N/A,29 7 2024
