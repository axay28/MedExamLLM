Recurrent aneurysm 11 years after thoracoabdominal aortic replacement due to recanalization of intercostal arteries of the wrapping native aorta in Marfan syndrome: a case report,,"Persistent reverse blood flow from the intercostal and lumbar arteries into the aortic aneurysm after an endovascular repair is common and is known as a type II endoleak. However, recanalization of thrombosed intercostal arteries after an open aortic repair is rare [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR1"">1</xref>, <xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR2"">2</xref>]. Herein, we report a case of induced aortic aneurysm recurrence after thoracoabdominal aortic replacement in a patient with Marfan syndrome. We describe our detailed clinical findings, treatment, and outcomes of this case. A 50-year-old woman diagnosed with Marfan syndrome presented with a 1-month history of left-sided back pain after meals. She did not undergo genetic testing but was diagnosed with Marfan syndrome based on her family history and clinical manifestations according to the revised Ghent criteria. The aorta was completely replaced in stages with prosthetic grafts (Fig. <xref rid=""Fig1"" ref-type=""fig"">1</xref>A). The patient had undergone abdominal aortic aneurysm replacement at 35 years of age and developed a type B acute aortic dissection 1 year later. When she was 38 years of age, the distal aortic arch and thoracoabdominal aorta were separately replaced with prosthetic grafts. At 43 years of age, she developed a type A acute aortic dissection and underwent replacement of the aortic root and the remaining aortic arch with a mechanical valved conduit. She has been taking warfarin ever since. The prothrombin time-international normalized ratio (PT-INR) was controlled almost within 1.5–2.5 during the follow-up period. It was elevated up to 3.4 at 1 month before she felt back pain. However, she did not experience any sign of ill-health, such as a common cold or gastroenteritis, which could affect the PT-INR. When the patient visited our department complaining of left back pain, her PT-INR level was 4.2. Enhanced computed tomography (CT) showed an aneurysm (55 mm) around the descending aortic graft compressing the esophagus. However, there were no abnormal findings on CT performed 10 months earlier. Aneurysmal expansion was considered caused by a hematoma between the graft and the remaining native aortic wall, which was used to wrap the graft. No contrast extravasation was evident in the arterial phase; however, there were two sites of mild extravasation in the venous phase (Fig. <xref rid=""Fig1"" ref-type=""fig"">1</xref>B, C). We suspected that the aneurysm recurred due to the backflow of blood from the right eighth and left tenth intercostal arteries of the wrapped aortic wall rather than anastomotic leakage. CT performed before the thoracoabdominal replacement showed that all intercostal arteries originated from the false lumen. The right 8th intercostal artery was patent (Fig. <xref rid=""Fig1"" ref-type=""fig"">1</xref>D), whereas the left 10th artery was occluded by a thrombus (Fig. <xref rid=""Fig1"" ref-type=""fig"">1</xref>E).<fig id=""Fig1""><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>Computed tomography images of the aneurysm. <bold>A</bold> A 3D computed tomography (CT) image of the whole aorta. <bold>B</bold> and <bold>C</bold> CT images showing the recurrent aneurysm.

We did not confirm the Adamkiewicz artery preoperatively or monitor motor-evoked potentials during surgery because we estimated a low risk of paraplegia by controlling backflow through recanalized intercostal arteries. In previous surgeries, large intercostal and lumbar arteries were reconstructed for spinal circulation, including the 6th and 11th intercostal and 1st and 3rd lumbar arteries. The internal pressure of the sac was 10 mm Hg when the systolic blood pressure was 90 mm Hg. Longitudinal incision of the aneurysm revealed abundant fresh and old clots inside the sac. The orifices of the right eighth and left tenth intercostal arteries were patent with backflow of blood and were closed using nonabsorbable sutures (Fig. <xref rid=""Fig2"" ref-type=""fig"">2</xref>). The orifice of the right seventh intercostal artery was also detected, but there was no blood backflow. This artery was suture ligated to prevent future recanalization. We found that the orifice of the left 7th intercostal artery had already been ligated in a previous surgery, and no other orifices of the intercostal arteries were detected. After suture ligation of the three detectable intercostal arteries, the arterial pressure was increased to 120 mmHg, and complete hemostasis from the intercostal arteries was confirmed. The graft was wrapped with the native aneurysmal wall. The patient’s postoperative course was uneventful, and she was discharged on postoperative day 10. CT performed 1 year later showed no aneurysmal recurrence.<fig id=""Fig2""><label>Fig. 2</label><caption><p>Intraoperative findings during hematoma removal from the native descending aortic wall and intercostal artery closure. <bold>A</bold> Aneurysm around the descending prosthetic graft. <bold>B</bold> White arrows indicate closed orifices of the right eighth and left tenth intercostal arteries</p></caption><graphic http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink href=""44215_2023_84_Fig2_HTML"" id=""MO2""></graphic></fig> We experienced this very rare case of recurrent aortic aneurysm at 11 years after graft replacement resulting from recanalization of the intercostal arteries of the remaining aortic wall. This recanalization was similar to a type II endoleak after endovascular treatment. No backflow was observed during the thoracoabdominal replacement surgery; hence, the intercostal arteries were not closed. It would be interesting to discern what triggered the intercostal artery recanalization 11 years after the aortic replacement. Because the PT-INR was remarkably high 1 month before her back pain appeared, an excess dose of anticoagulants might have dissolved the clots in the intercostal arteries. Some previous reports described similar situations in an abdominal aortic aneurysm [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR1"">1</xref>–<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR3"">3</xref>]. One described a case of delayed recanalization of the lumbar artery after open repair of an abdominal aortic aneurysm [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR1"">1</xref>]. Another described the recanalization of previously thrombosed type II endoleak after endovascular repair for an abdominal aortic aneurysm [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR3"">3</xref>]. Systemic thrombolysis was suspected to be the cause of the events in both reports. Moreover, a previous study reported that persistent blood flow within the excluded aneurysm sac was found in 2% of patients who underwent abdominal aortic repair with a retroperitoneal aortic bypass, and that patients receiving chronic anticoagulation or those with extensive collaterals appear to be at higher risk for persistent flow within the aneurysm sac [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR2"">2</xref>]. From these perspectives, mechanical valve-associated excessive anticoagulation is considered a reasonable cause of recanalization of the intercostal arteries in our case, even at a remote time after the original aortic surgery. After most of the intercostal and lumbar arteries were sacrificed via staged total aortic replacement, the slow formation of the collateral network might have affected the recanalization of the intercostal arteries. Although infection can influence recanalization, there were no apparent pre- or intraoperative findings suggestive of an active or healed infection. Its direct association with Marfan syndrome is uncertain, but the fragility of the aortic wall may provoke its expansion, even by low-pressure oozing through the intercostal arteries. Then, patients with Marfan syndrome tend to be at the aforementioned risk of undergoing multiple aortic and valve surgeries with possible mechanical valves in their life. We chose to perform open repair through a left thoracotomy because the patient had symptoms of back pain due to an aneurysm compressing the esophagus. Transcatheter intervention to occlude the responsible intercostal arteries could be a less invasive treatment option in asymptomatic cases in the hope that the aneurysmal hematoma would gradually dissolve [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR4"">4</xref>]. Closing all orifices of the intercostal arteries during open aortic repair could prevent delayed reopening of the intercostal arteries after aortic repair. After encountering this case, we routinely changed the strategy of aortic repair to close every orifice of the intercostal arteries, regardless of blood backflow. Furthermore, wrapping the graft with the native aorta could prevent pseudoaneurysm formation or bleeding into the thoracic cavity. Lifelong periodical observation by CT is essential for the early detection of unexpected and rare complications even after total aortic graft replacement. In conclusion, here, we described a case in which a descending aortic aneurysm recurred 11 years after a graft replacement due to recanalization of the intercostal arteries of the wrapping native aorta like a type II endoleak in a patient with Marfan syndrome. Our findings suggest that, to prevent this delayed adverse event, the closure of all orifices of the intercostal arteries during aortic repair, regardless of backflow, is necessary. Systemic anticoagulation therapy after aortic replacement may be a risk factor for recanalization. Thus, lifelong periodic CT observation is essential, even after graft replacement of the entire aorta.",N/A,3 8 2023
Staged valve-sparing aortic root replacement and minimally invasive repair of pectus excavatum in a 43-year-old patient with Marfan syndrome,,"A 43-year-old man with scoliosis, hypermobile joints, pes planus, and PEx presented with 6-month history of progressively worsening intermittent chest pain, exertional dyspnea, and palpitations. Chest imaging revealed a 5.2-cm ARAn (<xref rid=""fig1"" ref-type=""fig"">Figure 1</xref>, <italic toggle=""yes"">A</italic>), and significant right ventricular compression from severe PEx (<xref rid=""fig1"" ref-type=""fig"">Figure 1</xref>, <italic toggle=""yes"">B</italic>), (Haller index >4.1, correction index 34%). Subsequent echocardiogram noted normal (57%) left ventricular ejection fraction without significant valvular disease but reduced right-sided stroke volume secondary to compression and compromised right ventricular outflow tract with inferior vena cava dilation. Surgical intervention was indicated for both conditions. The patient underwent valve-sparing aortic root replacement followed by 24-hour cardiovascular intensive care unit monitoring before MIRPE, minimizing the potential re-entry complications, in the setting of pectus repair, for postoperative root bleeding.<fig id=""fig1""><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>A, Coronal computed tomography angiography demonstrating significant aortic root aneurysm.

Chest pain and dyspnea are common complaints in PEx; however, can also signal expanding ARAn.

Our staged approach aimed to minimize complications by optimizing patient hemodynamics and coagulation.

Apoptosis is increased in cortical neurons of female Marfan Syndrome mice,"Marfan Syndrome (MFS) is an autosomal dominant genetic disorder that affects connective tissue throughout the body due to mutations in the <italic toggle=""yes"">FBN1</italic> gene. Individuals with MFS display symptoms in different organs, particularly in the vasculature, but the mechanisms of this multi-system dysfunction are still under investigation. There is still a gap in our understanding of the impact of monogenic connective tissue aberrations on the brain. This study aims to determine the impact of MFS on neurodegeneration, in cortical brain tissue of male and female MFS mice. Brain tissue of 6-month-old female and male mice with the <italic toggle=""yes"">FBN1</italic><sup><italic toggle=""yes"">C1041G/+</italic></sup> mutation and wildtype litter mates was collected and stained for active caspase-3 (ac3), brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), and neuronal nuclei (NeuN) or with TUNEL and DAPI. Data revealed increased levels of ac3 in neurons within the sensory and motor cortical areas of female MFS mice compared to sex- and age-matched controls. We confirm increased levels of apoptosis in MFS mice using TUNEL staining within the same brain areas. We also report increased levels of neuronal BDNF levels in cortical brain tissue of male and female MFS mice. These results indicate a heightened susceptibility for neurodegeneration in the mouse model of MFS.","Marfan syndrome (MFS) is a hereditary systemic disorder of the connective tissue caused by mutations in the gene encoding for the large glycoprotein fibrillin 1 (FBN1) that affects the cardiovascular, pulmonary, musculoskeletal, and ocular systems [<xref rid=""R1"" ref-type=""bibr"">1</xref>]. MFS can lead to manifestations such as aortic root aneurysm, scoliosis, pneumothorax, and lens dislocation, with aortic root dissection and rupture considered the most life-threatening complications [<xref rid=""R2"" ref-type=""bibr"">2</xref>]. The development of animal models of MFS has been instrumental in understanding the underlying mechanisms contributing to vascular complications in MFS. The use of <italic toggle=""yes"">FBN1</italic> mutant mice has shed light on how mutations in the <italic toggle=""yes"">FBN1</italic> gene can disrupt the regulation of the downstream protein transforming growth factor beta (TGF-β) protein [<xref rid=""R3"" ref-type=""bibr"">3</xref>]. This disruption results in increased expression and activity of matrix metalloproteinases 2 and 9 (MMP-2 & −9), leading to extracellular matrix degradation and weakening of connective tissues, particularly in vital organs such as the heart, lungs, aorta, and brain [<xref rid=""R4"" ref-type=""bibr"">4</xref>–<xref rid=""R6"" ref-type=""bibr"">6</xref>]. In addition, significant increases in tissue proteases MMP-2 and −9 can enhance inflammatory responses, exacerbating the pathology [<xref rid=""R7"" ref-type=""bibr"">7</xref>]. Despite recent advances in understanding the mechanisms involved in the development of MFS-associated aortopathy, there has been limited focus on the potential neurological and cerebrovascular implications. Previous clinical studies in MFS patients have revealed complications such as impaired cerebral blood flow, epilepsy, cephalgia, and varicose spinal veins, with reported increases in chronic migraine, neurodivergence, and intracranial aneurysms and stroke [<xref rid=""R8"" ref-type=""bibr"">8</xref>–<xref rid=""R10"" ref-type=""bibr"">10</xref>]. We have also recently reported a significant decrease in cerebral blood flow (CBF) in the mouse model of MFS (<italic toggle=""yes"">FBN1</italic>
<sup><italic toggle=""yes"">C1041G/+</italic></sup>) [<xref rid=""R11"" ref-type=""bibr"">11</xref>], underscoring the potential impact of FBN1 abnormalities on cerebrovascular and brain function. Reduced CBF is linked to cognitive decline in patients with dementia [<xref rid=""R12"" ref-type=""bibr"">12</xref>]. Other studies have reported that reduced CBF can lead to hypoxia and nutrient deprivation, triggering oxidative stress, inflammation, cellular stress response, and apoptosis, resulting in neural damage and cell death [<xref rid=""R13"" ref-type=""bibr"">13</xref>]. Apoptosis, or programmed cell death, is a fundamental process in the brain, playing key roles in maintaining normal brain homeostasis, establishing neural networks, removing damaged cells and proteins, and responding to brain injuries [<xref rid=""R14"" ref-type=""bibr"">14</xref>]. Dysregulation is such an important and corrective mechanism which can lead to various brain pathologies, including neurodegenerative diseases and impaired recovery from injury [<xref rid=""R15"" ref-type=""bibr"">15</xref>,<xref rid=""R16"" ref-type=""bibr"">16</xref>]. In this study, we aim to investigate the presence and extent of apoptosis in the brain tissue of both male and female MFS mice (<italic toggle=""yes"">FBN1</italic>
<sup><italic toggle=""yes"">C1041G/+</italic></sup>), with the aim of filling the existing knowledge gap regarding brain pathology in MFS. We anticipate that this study provides new insights into the broader implications of this connective tissue disorder, suggesting more effective therapeutic approaches to improve the quality of life in individuals with MFS.  We assessed the levels of ac3-positive neuronal cells within the cortical tissue of male and female control and MFS mice. <xref rid=""F1"" ref-type=""fig"">Figure 1A</xref> shows representative images of ac3 and NeuN staining in female control and MFS mice. Our quantification showed an interaction between sex and genotype (<xref rid=""F1"" ref-type=""fig"">Figure 1B</xref>, F (<sub>1, 12</sub>) = 10.38, <italic toggle=""yes"">p</italic> = 0.0073). There were increased levels of ac3 and NeuN positive cells in female MFS mice brain (<italic toggle=""yes"">p</italic> < 0.02), with no changes observed in age-matched male MFS mice. There was no effect of sex (<italic toggle=""yes"">p</italic> = 0.97) or genotype (<italic toggle=""yes"">p</italic> = 0.121). To further confirm apoptosis, we measured levels of TUNEL and DAPI colocalization in cortical brain tissue (<xref rid=""F2"" ref-type=""fig"">Figure 2A</xref>). There was an increase in MFS mouse brain tissue compared to wildtype controls (<xref rid=""F2"" ref-type=""fig"">Figure 2B</xref>, F (<sub>1, 8</sub>) = 12.13, <italic toggle=""yes"">p</italic> = 0.0083). There was no significant interaction (<italic toggle=""yes"">p</italic> = 0.79) or sex difference (<italic toggle=""yes"">p</italic> = 0.06). To measure plasticity within cortical tissue we stained collected mice brain tissue for the brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF). Representative images from female MFS mice are shown in <xref rid=""F3"" ref-type=""fig"">Figure 3A</xref>. As presented in <xref rid=""F3"" ref-type=""fig"">Figure 3B</xref>, there were increased levels of neuronal BDNF levels in brain tissue in both female and male MFS brain tissue compared to age-matched control littermates (<xref rid=""F3"" ref-type=""fig"">Figure 3B</xref>, F (<sub>1, 11</sub>) = 8.782, p = 0.012). There were no differences between sex (p = 0.225) or interactions between sex and genotype (p = 0.922). MFS is primarily known for its impact on cardiovascular, skeletal, and ocular systems. However, evidence suggests that MFS may also involve neurological complications, potentially due to weakened connective tissue in the brain’s vasculature and extracellular matrix. This could lead to structural brain abnormalities, microvascular dysfunction, and even increased vulnerability to neurodegeneration. Investigating cell death mechanisms, such as apoptosis and necrosis, within brain tissue can provide insight into how these processes contribute to neurological symptoms like headaches, migraines, or even cognitive impairments reported in MFS. This study aimed to fill the gap in our understanding of the impact of monogenic connective tissue aberrations on the brain, specially focusing on neurodegeneration of cortical brain tissue in male and female MFS mice. Our study revealed increased levels of active (cleaved) caspase 3 in neurons within the sensory and motor cortical areas of female MFS mice compared to sex- and age-matched controls. We further confirmed increased levels of apoptosis in MFS mice using TUNEL staining within the same brain areas. We also report increased levels of neuronal BDNF levels in cortical brain tissue of male and female MFS mice These results indicate a heightened susceptibility for neurodegeneration in MFS<sup>+/−</sup> mice, where BDNF may be upregulated in compensation for ongoing cell death or to increase neurotropic support to neurons. Clinical studies have reported that individuals with MFS have increased risk for cerebrovascular alterations due to their vascular tortuosity phenotype [<xref rid=""R19"" ref-type=""bibr"">19</xref>]. A recent study investigating the neuropathology in the same MFS mouse model showed a systemic pre-mature aging phenotype is present in the six-month old mice [<xref rid=""R20"" ref-type=""bibr"">20</xref>]. Specifically, the researchers reported reductions in blood flow of the posterior cerebral artery, as well as increased blood-brain permeability and neuroinflammation [<xref rid=""R20"" ref-type=""bibr"">20</xref>]. The present study has added to the neurological phenotype of the MFS. Within the sensory and motor cortex, MFS mice showed increased levels of apoptotic neurons compared to wildtype animals along with increased levels of plasticity.. Interestingly, neuronal active caspase-3 levels were significantly increased in the females compared to the males, this is an interesting sex-dependent phenotype in the mouse model of MFS. Clinically, mortality as a result of MFS affects males and females at an equal rate [<xref rid=""R21"" ref-type=""bibr"">21</xref>]. However, there are sex differences in described outcomes both in clinical and preclinical studies [<xref rid=""R22"" ref-type=""bibr"">22</xref>]. A possible explanation for the observed sex difference in our present study might be the age of the mice, estrogen has been shown to be neuroprotective in brain response to stress [<xref rid=""R23"" ref-type=""bibr"">23</xref>,<xref rid=""R24"" ref-type=""bibr"">24</xref>]. In conclusion, our findings reveal an increased vulnerability to neurodegeneration in the cortical tissue of both male and female MFS mice at 6 months of age. This study is the first to characterize the impact of MFS on neurodegenerative processes in a well-established and commonly used MFS mouse model. Notable, we observed elevated levels of neural plasticity in sexes, which may be associated with the increased levels of neurodegeneration. These novel insights into the neural pathology of MFS underscore the need for further research to delineate the temporal progression of neurodegeneration and to explore additional pathological markers involved in programmed cell death and neural plasticity pathways in the mouse model of MFS.",N/A,17 10 2024

 Marfan syndrome (MFS) is a hereditary connective tissue disorder with an estimated prevalence of 1:5000–1:10 000 individuals. It is a pleiotropic disease characterized by specific ocular, cardiovascular, and skeletal features. The most common cardiovascular complication is aortic root dilatation which untreated can lead to life-threatening aortic root dissection, mainly occurring in adult patients. Prompt diagnosis, appropriate follow-up, and timely treatment can prevent aortic events. Currently there are no specific recommendations for treatment of children with MFS, and management is greatly based on adult guidelines. Furthermore, due to the scarcity of studies including children, there is a lack of uniform treatment across different centres. This consensus document aims at bridging these gaps of knowledge. This work is a joint collaboration between the paediatric subgroup of the European Network of Vascular Diseases (VASCERN, Heritable Thoracic Aortic Disease Working Group) and the Association for European Paediatric and Congenital Cardiology (AEPC). A group of experts from 12 different centres and 8 different countries participated in this effort. This document reviews four main subjects, namely, (i) imaging of the aorta at diagnosis and follow-up, (ii) recommendations on medical treatment, (iii) recommendations on surgical treatment, and (iv) recommendations on sport participation.","This joint statement document by the paediatric subgroup of the European Reference Network of Vascular Diseases (VASCERN) and the Association for European Paediatric and Congenital Cardiology (AEPC) represents their first collaborative effort.

Accurate and reproducible aortic measurement is crucial for the diagnosis, surveillance, and management. Additionally, surgical planning relies on quantification of absolute diameters. There are no established recommendations on imaging and surveillance in children with MFS except for Canadian guidelines which attempt a time frame for baseline assessment and 6-monthly monitoring with 2D transthoracic echocardiography (2D-TTE), without actually prescribing clear intervals for CTA/MRI.<sup><xref rid=""ehae526-B31"" ref-type=""bibr"">31</xref></sup> It has been common practice to adapt adult guidelines in the absence of a more tailored and children centred approach.<sup><xref rid=""ehae526-B22"" ref-type=""bibr"">22</xref></sup>    Aortic disease in MFS remains the main cause of morbidity and mortality in this group of patients.

Phenotypic Heterogeneity of Patients With Marfan Syndrome in Puerto Rico: A Case Series,"Purpose: Previous studies have reported on the cardiovascular, ocular, and musculoskeletal findings in patients with Marfan syndrome (MFS). This study aims to report the ocular and genotypic findings in patients with the syndrome in Puerto Rico. Patients and methods: A chart review of a cohort of patients with the syndrome from Puerto Rico was done. Patients were examined by at least one of the authors (NJI). Fibrillin-1 (<italic toggle=""yes"">FBN1</italic>) full gene sequencing was done to all patients (Laboratory for Molecular Medicine, Center for Genetics and Genomics, Cambridge, MA). This study was approved by the Institutional Review Board of the Universidad Central del Caribe (approval number: 2024-07).  Results: Six patients aged 28-79 years were examined. There were seven female and three male patients. The average visual acuity was 0.49 and 0.52 in the right eye (OD) and left eye (OS), respectively. The average refraction (spherical equivalent) was -1.28 sph OD and -1.07 sph OS. The average intraocular pressure was 14 mmHg in both eyes (OU). A patient had a dislocated lens OD; a patient had lens dislocation OU; and a patient had prosthesis OD and aphakia OS. Upon optical coherence tomography (OCT), the retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) average was 75.86 µm OD and 81.85 ​​µm OS; the average cup-to-disc (C/D) ratio was 0.41 and 0.35 in the right and left eye, respectively. Upon visual field testing, the average mean deviation (MD) was -6.27 dB OD and -8.55 dB OS. Conclusions: Our findings underscore the significant phenotypic and genotypic heterogeneity of patients with MFS in Puerto Rico. The identification of several mutations in the <italic toggle=""yes"">FBN1</italic> gene in the Puerto Rican population demonstrates the need for an up-to-date approach to diagnose and co-manage patients with the syndrome.

Clinical diagnosis relies on the revised Ghent criteria [<xref rid=""REF2"" ref-type=""bibr"">2</xref>], emphasizing the importance of early detection and co-management to mitigate life-threatening cardiovascular risks, such as aortic aneurysms and dissections [<xref rid=""REF1"" ref-type=""bibr"">1</xref>].  Ocular findings in patients with the syndrome have been reported extensively [<xref rid=""REF3"" ref-type=""bibr"">3</xref>]. Findings in patients with the syndrome include elongated axial length (myopia), strabismus, cornea plana, glaucoma, ectopia lentis, and retinal detachment [<xref rid=""REF4"" ref-type=""bibr"">4</xref>,<xref rid=""REF5"" ref-type=""bibr"">5</xref>].  Musculoskeletal manifestations in patients with the syndrome include long extremities, arachnodactyly, dolichostenomelia, positive wrist and ulnar signs, scoliosis, pectus excavatum or carinatum, and pes planus [<xref rid=""REF6"" ref-type=""bibr"">6</xref>].

Significant expression of <italic toggle=""yes"">FBN1</italic> mRNA is observed in various tissues such as the cultured fibroblasts, subcutaneous adipose tissue, aorta and coronary arteries, esophagus, tibial nerve, and ovaries [<xref rid=""REF8"" ref-type=""bibr"">8</xref>]. The amount of <italic toggle=""yes"">FBN1</italic> in the human eye varies per person [<xref rid=""REF9"" ref-type=""bibr"">9</xref>]. It is mostly found in ciliary zonules which if mutated can lead to ectopia lentis [<xref rid=""REF3"" ref-type=""bibr"">3</xref>]. Alterations in <italic toggle=""yes"">FBN1</italic> play a role in the development of numerous diseases in humans. Interestingly, both a decrease and an increase in <italic toggle=""yes"">FBN1</italic> levels can enhance the availability and signaling of transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-β) [<xref rid=""REF8"" ref-type=""bibr"">8</xref>]. In pathological circumstances, imbalanced <italic toggle=""yes"">FBN1</italic> can either stimulate tumor cell growth or trigger apoptosis in endothelial cells [<xref rid=""REF10"" ref-type=""bibr"">10</xref>]. There is a paradoxical effect, where diminished <italic toggle=""yes"">FBN1</italic> levels due to variants trigger TGF-β pathway activation, contributing to the advancement of fibrillinopathies [<xref rid=""REF11"" ref-type=""bibr"">11</xref>]. To support this theory, experiments involving the administration of TGF-β antagonists have been shown to exert a protective, anti-apoptotic effect in the lungs of mice with <italic toggle=""yes"">FBN1</italic> deficits [<xref rid=""REF12"" ref-type=""bibr"">12</xref>]. This indicates that <italic toggle=""yes"">FBN1</italic>'s control over TGF-β signaling might fluctuate depending on genetic factors or the presence of disease, highlighting the intricate and context-specific nature of <italic toggle=""yes"">FBN1</italic>'s actions [<xref rid=""REF8"" ref-type=""bibr"">8</xref>]. We report on the ocular and genotype findings of six patients with MFS in Puerto Rico.  A chart review of a cohort of patients with the syndrome from a single center in Puerto Rico was done. Patients were selected based on a set of inclusion criteria. All subjects were diagnosed with MFS according to the revised Ghent criteria, which include a combination of clinical manifestations, family history, and genetic testing. Patients were examined by at least one of the authors (NJI). <italic toggle=""yes"">FBN1</italic> full gene sequencing was performed for all patients (Laboratory for Molecular Medicine, Center for Genetics and Genomics, Cambridge, MA). Patients of all ages were included if they had a positive <italic toggle=""yes"">FBN1</italic> gene mutation test result. These six patients underwent a comprehensive ophthalmic examination. The examination included intraocular pressure (IOP) measurement, optic nerve coherence tomography, and visual field testing, among others. We focused specifically on individuals residing in Puerto Rico to understand the regional manifestations and variations of MFS. This study was approved by the Institutional Review Board of the Universidad Central del Caribe (approval number: 2024-07).  Six patients aged 28-79 years were examined, of which four were females and two were males as summarized in Table <xref rid=""TAB1"" ref-type=""table"">1</xref>. The best corrected visual acuity (LogMAR) ranged from 0.0 to 0.6 in the right eye (OD) (avg=0.34) and 0.1 to 1.3 in the left eye (OS) (avg=0.43). Refraction (spherical equivalent) ranged from -8.75 to +1.875 (avg=-3.78) and -8.50 to +3.75 (avg=-2.41) in the right and left eye, respectively. IOP had a range of 12-15 OD (avg=13.8) and 12-15 OS (avg=13.5). Three out of the six patients presented with bilateral lens subluxation. One patient presents with a prosthetic right eye. The retinal fiber layer ranged from 73 µm to 93 µm (avg=86 µm) and 43 µm to 96 µm (avg=78.7 µm) in the right and left eye, respectively. The average cup-to-disc (C/D) ratio ranged from 0.07 to 0.62 (avg=0.44) and 0.08 to 0.63 (avg=0.35) in the right and left eye, respectively. The visual field testing mean deviation (MD) ranged from -21.78 to -1.92 OD (avg=-9.86) and -28.63 to -1.80 OS (avg=-11.75).  Gehle and co-workers reported that patients with MFS had worse visual acuity when compared to their control group. Gehle et al.'s patients had an average visual acuity of 0.13 logMAR. Our patients' visual acuity was an average of 0.34 logMAR OD and 0.43 logMAR OS. This finding is slightly different than previously reported visual acuity in patients with the syndrome. This difference highlights the importance of regular ophthalmic checkup and optimal refraction in patients with the syndrome [<xref rid=""REF13"" ref-type=""bibr"">13</xref>]. In Gehle et al.'s study, 67.4% of patients with MFS had a myopia of >0.75 D, while 31.4% of patients had >3 D. In our series, patients had an average refraction of -3.78 D and -2.41 D in the right and left eye, respectively. These findings are compatible with previous studies. Patients with the syndrome may have axial and lenticular myopia [<xref rid=""REF14"" ref-type=""bibr"">14</xref>].  Gehle et al.'s study reported a lower average IOP in patients with MFS compared to the control group [<xref rid=""REF13"" ref-type=""bibr"">13</xref>]. The average IOP of their patients was 14.6 mmHg compared to 15.1 mmHg in the control patients. Our patients had an average IOP of 13.6 mmHg. Patients in our sample have lower average IOP. However, there is a need for regular IOP measurements and glaucoma screening in patients with the syndrome. Maumenee reported that 60% of patients with MFS have ectopia lentis [<xref rid=""REF15"" ref-type=""bibr"">15</xref>]. In our series, 50% of patients with the syndrome had lens dislocation. These findings are compatible with previous literature. It is important to realize that not all patients with the syndrome have ectopia lentis [<xref rid=""REF16"" ref-type=""bibr"">16</xref>]. Xu and co-workers reported the distribution of macular and optic nerve topography in individuals aged 8-56 years with MFS through the use of spectral domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT) [<xref rid=""REF17"" ref-type=""bibr"">17</xref>]. The results showed that 18% of the eyes of patients with the syndrome had a retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) thickness in <5% of the population [<xref rid=""REF17"" ref-type=""bibr"">17</xref>]. We report on a cohort of patients between the ages of 28 and 79 who demonstrated an average RNFL thickness of 82 μm. These findings are concordant with Xu and co-worker's cohort study. Studies done at Northwestern University in Chicago [<xref rid=""REF17"" ref-type=""bibr"">17</xref>] reported that patients with MFS have an average C/D ratio of 0.46. Patients in our sample had a C/D ratio of 0.39. Our findings are compatible.  Previous studies have reported that patients with MFS have an increased propensity for glaucoma. In our study, upon Humphrey's visual field testing, MD ranged from -21.78 dB to -1.92 dB OD (avg=-9.86 dB) and -28.63 dB to -1.80 dB OS (avg=-11.75 dB). To our knowledge, this is the first report of visual field testing of patients with MFS. Limitations of the study include a small sample size and a single center.  Our findings underscore the significant phenotypic and genotypic heterogeneity of patients with MFS in the Puerto Rican population. The identification of several mutations in the <italic toggle=""yes"">FBN1</italic> gene in the Puerto Rican population demonstrates the need for an up-to-date approach to diagnose and co-manage patients with the syndrome. This study contributes to a deeper understanding of the genetic heritage of patients with the syndrome and highlights the potential for personalized therapeutic interventions.",N/A,6 9 2024
Florida Sleeve Technique for an Aortic Root Aneurysm in a Marfan Syndrome Patient,Valve-sparing aortic root replacement is not widely performed due to technical requirements. The Florida sleeve technique (FST) is a new technique for aortic root remodeling with the preservation of the aortic valve without aortic root wall resection and coronary artery reconstruction. We successfully treated with the FST for a Marfan syndrome patient with an aortic root aneurysm and aortic valve insufficiency. We believe that this technique is very suitable for cases with moderately enlarged aortic roots. It could reduce surgical risks and prevent dilatation of the aortic root through coverage with a graft for a long time.,"Surgical techniques for aortic root dilatation combined with aortic valve insufficiency (AI) include conventional root replacement (Bentall operation) and valve-sparing aortic root replacement (VSARR), remodeling (Yacoub procedure), or reimplantation (David procedure).<xref rid=""R1"" ref-type=""bibr""><sup>1</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid=""R2"" ref-type=""bibr""><sup>2)</sup></xref> Although VSARR has been reported to show excellent results in selected patients, it is not widely performed because of the technical demands. Therefore, many surgeons still prefer the Bentall operation rather than VSARR for aortic insufficiency associated with aortic root aneurysms. VSARR is attractive, but these surgical techniques are delicate and depend on experience. After seeking to simplify the surgical procedure, the “Florida sleeve” technique (FST) was reported by the University of Florida as a new technique for VSARR that does not require total aortic root wall resection and coronary artery reconstruction.<xref rid=""R3"" ref-type=""bibr""><sup>3)</sup></xref> Preservation of the shape of the sinus of Valsalva and prevention of dilatation of the aortic annulus are necessary to obtain long-term durability. We report a case of Marfan syndrome associated with aortic root aneurysm that was successfully treated using FST. A 26-year-old man was admitted for the surgical treatment of a left spontaneous pneumothorax. He was tall and thin, with scoliosis and typical Marfanoid habitus (height 191 cm, weight 56 kg, BMI = 15.4). His past medical history revealed surgical therapy for right pneumothorax 10 years ago. Computed tomography (CT) revealed an aortic root aneurysm with measurements of the aortic annulus, Valsalva sinus, and sinotubular junction (STJ) being 33 mm, 52 × 55 mm, and 35 mm, respectively (<xref rid=""figure1"" ref-type=""fig""><bold>Figs. 1A</bold></xref> and <xref rid=""figure1"" ref-type=""fig""><bold>1B</bold></xref>). It has dilated 14 mm compared to CT 10 years ago. He first underwent surgery for left pneumothorax. Preoperative echocardiography revealed an ejection fraction (EF) of 57.3%, with left ventricular diastolic and systolic dimensions (LVDd/Ds) measuring 48 mm and 34 mm, respectively. In addition, mild type I aortic regurgitation originating from the center, attributed to tethering associated with aortic root aneurysm, was observed (<xref rid=""figure1"" ref-type=""fig""><bold>Fig. 1C</bold></xref>). He was referred to our department for surgical management of aortic root aneurysm and AI found during a preoperative work-up for lung surgery. We diagnosed Marfan syndrome with aortic root enlargement combined with AI. Then, we performed aortic root surgery with the FST. After establishing cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) and aortic clamping, the cardioplegic solution was delivered in both an antegrade and a retrograde manner. The ascending aorta was transected above the STJ, the aortic root was mobilized to the aortic annular level, and the origins of the coronary arteries were mobilized. After measuring the aortic annular size (the 27 mm Hegar just passed the annulus) and geometric height (gH) of 20 mm, the target valve annulus diameter was established at 27 mm, and consequently, a graft upsized by 3 mm was selected for use. A 30-mm vascular graft (Gelweave Valsalva; Terumo Inc., Tokyo, Japan) was trimmed with two keyholes aligned with the height of the coronary orifice (<xref rid=""figure2"" ref-type=""fig""><bold>Fig. 2A</bold></xref>). Then, six anchoring sutures were made on the lowest level of the annulus at the commissure and midpoint of each leaflet to fix the wrapping graft. The sleeve graft was located at the aortic root, and a Hegar dilator was placed through the annulus into the left ventricle to prevent purse-stringing the annulus when the sutures were tied down. Then, resuspension sutures at the commissures are placed. A running horizontal mattress suture was employed at the level of the STJ, securing the aorta and the graft to a felt strip circumferentially (<xref rid=""figure2"" ref-type=""fig""><bold>Fig. 2B</bold></xref>). The aortic valve was confirmed for adequate coaptation of the leaflets with static saline testing. The new STJ was anastomosed to the distal ascending aorta to complete the Florida sleeve root repair (<xref rid=""figure2"" ref-type=""fig""><bold>Fig. 2C</bold></xref>). After CPB weaning, transesophageal echocardiography confirmed the morphology of the aortic root and elimination of regurgitation. Aortic clamping and CPB times were 213 and 270 minutes, respectively. Red blood cells were not needed; however, due to low fibrinogen and platelets, 4 units of FFP (Fresh Frozen Plasma) and 20 units of platelets were transfused. An additional movie file shows this in more detail (<xref rid=""sm1"" ref-type=""supplementary-material""><bold>Supplementary Movie</bold></xref>). The postoperative course was uneventful, and CT and echocardiographic evaluations were performed a week after surgery. They demonstrated a competent aortic valve with no regurgitation, excellent coaptation height (9 mm) of the aortic valve, and a stable aortic graft without any distortion or leakage. Serial follow-up echocardiographic assessments were performed up to 1 year after surgery. The morphological changes in the aortic root were noted by comparing the imaging findings before surgery. CT showed a reduction of Valsalva from 55 to 39 mm and annulus from 32 to 28 mm (<xref rid=""figure3"" ref-type=""fig""><bold>Figs. 3A</bold></xref> and <xref rid=""figure3"" ref-type=""fig""><bold>3B</bold></xref>). In the echocardiographic assessment, EF was 68.8%, with LVDd/Ds measuring 46 mm and 29 mm, respectively. Coaptation height and effective height were measured at 8 mm and 11 mm, respectively, and the annular diameter was 26 mm, with no AI observed (<xref rid=""figure3"" ref-type=""fig""><bold>Fig. 3C</bold></xref>). VSARR has been established for aortic root dilatation with or without aortic valve regurgitation. In these operations, the wall of the sinus of Valsalva is usually resected, and the creation of a neoaortic sinus is necessary. The procedures involved in forming the proper shape of the sinus of Valsalva and precisely tailoring the graft are complex; therefore, this approach has technical challenges and a learning curve. Hess et al.<xref rid=""R4"" ref-type=""bibr""><sup>3)</sup></xref> described a new technique, the “Florida sleeve,” for aortic root remodeling. This valve-sparing technique involves protecting the aortic root with a Dacron graft sleeve without resection to preserve native tissue in place. The most important advantage of this technique is its technical simplicity, which eliminates the need for coronary artery reconstruction and greatly reduces the suturing of the Valsalva sinus. As a result, this technique can shorten the procedural time and reduce anastomotic bleeding (intraoperative complications). Therefore, it may be more easily reproducible than conventional VSARR. The coronary keyhole was created as previously described.<xref rid=""R3"" ref-type=""bibr""><sup>3)</sup></xref> We made it approximately 10mm in diameter to not interfere with the coronary origin. Gamba et al.<xref rid=""R4"" ref-type=""bibr""><sup>4)</sup></xref> also reported that keyholes were created approximately 1cm in diameter. There were no complications of coronary kinking or stenosis in either report.<xref rid=""R4"" ref-type=""bibr""><sup>4</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid=""R5"" ref-type=""bibr""><sup>5)</sup></xref> Because of its minimal invasiveness, this procedure is considered appropriate for elderly patients. Hess et al.<xref rid=""R5"" ref-type=""bibr""><sup>5)</sup></xref> reported that clinical and echocardiographic outcomes showed excellent results at mid-term follow-up. No patient needed reoperation or reintervention of the aortic valve, proximal coronary arteries, or ascending aorta. According to the authors, the reduction of the left ventricular dimension 3years after surgery suggested that FST is a durable valve repair approach. The FST, however, has several potential drawbacks. Since the enlarged aortic sinus has to be inserted in a smaller graft, anatomical distortion of the aortic root can be created. The distortion between the residual aortic sinus and vascular graft can cause aortic insufficiency and coronary malperfusion, both of which can be fatal. Therefore, extreme caution should be taken while tailoring the artificial graft and anchoring it to the native aortic wall. The coronary ostium should also be positioned as carefully as possible to prevent kinking or obstruction of the origins of the coronary artery. Although, in the present case, the enlargement of the sinus of Valsalva was not very severe, considering that the patient had Marfan syndrome, there was a very high likelihood of further deterioration of the aortic root, necessitating relatively early surgical intervention. We suggest that FST is a good indication of this degree of Valsalva morphology change. However, as David commented,<xref rid=""R6"" ref-type=""bibr""><sup>6)</sup></xref> FST for severe enlargement is expected to distort the aortic wall, so VSARR is preferred. We believe that this technique is highly suitable for cases with moderately enlarged Valsalva sinus diameters of 55–60 mm accompanied by concentric regurgitation jets. When a root aneurysm is >6 cm, redundant tissue could create turbulent flow in the remodeled aortic root, which may reduce the durability of the sleeve technique. The FST is associated with encouraging results in Marfan syndrome patients with aortic root aneurysms. Aortic root aneurysm is common in patients with Marfan syndrome, and the University of Florida has been using FST in these patients since the procedure was first developed. However, some surgeons have concerns about the long-term durability and dimensional stability of this repair and about the potential need for reoperation in these patients. The FST provides more physiologic-like aortic wall stress and might prolong durability.<xref rid=""R7"" ref-type=""bibr""><sup>7)</sup></xref> A retrospective study showed that the FST is a viable option for patients with Marfan syndrome with a significant reduction in aortic insufficiency grade postoperatively, and the survival rate and freedom from reoperation were 94% and 100% at 8 years, respectively.<xref rid=""R8"" ref-type=""bibr""><sup>8)</sup></xref> Although the FST has been applied in cases with Valsalva dimensions greater than 60 mm, it should be considered cautiously as a treatment option due to the limited long-term data available. We hope that our report will lead to the indications for FST in limited patients with Marfan syndrome and may allow preservation of the native aortic valve without experiencing an aortic event. In conclusion, we report a Marfan patient with an aortic root aneurysm combined with AI who was successfully treated with FST. The FST is a promising surgical option for Marfan patients who need aortic root repair. It offers many advantages, such as preservation of the native valve and a lower risk of complications and reoperation, but its long-term results are still under study. To further verify the feasibility and reproducibility of this new technique, experiences in a larger number of patients with long-term follow-up are needed.  ",N/A,21 6 2024

Marfan syndrome, a genetic disorder affecting connective tissue and impacting cardiovascular, ocular, and skeletal systems, is frequently linked with aortic root dilation and dissection. This syndrome is attributed to mutations in the FBN1 gene responsible for fibrillin-1 production, a crucial component of extracellular matrix microfibrils [<xref rid=""bb0010"" ref-type=""bibr"">2</xref>]. This case describes a distinctive clinical scenario where a 36-year-old male displaying features indicative of Marfan syndrome remained largely asymptomatic despite a substantial aortic dissection spanning from the ascending aorta to the abdominal aorta. This atypical presentation challenges conventional perceptions of aortic dissections, particularly in the context of Marfan syndrome, underscoring the significance of early detection and intervention to avoid adverse consequences. This work is also reported in line with SCARE criteria which helped to improve the transparency and quality of this case report [<xref rid=""bb0015"" ref-type=""bibr"">3</xref>]. A 36-year-old male presented with a 3-day history of fever and cough, with no complaints of chest, back, or abdominal pain. Vital signs included a blood pressure of 120/70 mmHg, heart rate of 90 bpm, temperature of 39 °C, respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 92 %. Physical examination revealed bilateral fine crackles and a grade 3/6 diastolic heart murmur at the aortic area. Clinical features suggestive of Marfan syndrome were identified. Chest X-ray exhibited bilateral interstitial infiltrates, while CT scan demonstrated bilateral hyperinflation infiltrates and an aortic dissection. Laboratory investigations revealed elevated white blood cell count, neutrophils, and CRP levels. Transthoracic echocardiography confirmed aortic root dilatation, left atrial dilatation, severe aortic valve regurgitation, and an aortic dissection extending from the ascending to the abdominal aorta that represents Stanford type A dissection [<xref rid=""bb0020"" ref-type=""bibr"">4</xref>] (<xref rid=""f0005"" ref-type=""fig"">Fig. 1</xref>).

Multislice computed tomography (MSCT) angiography revealed an extensive aortic dissection. Pharmacological management included the administration of metoprolol. Surgical consultation recommended aortic root and valve replacement, a suggestion declined by the patient due to financial constraints. After a span of 6 months, echocardiography demonstrated a stable aortic dissection and associated cardiac anomalies despite ongoing medical therapy. Aortic dissection, a critical cardiovascular emergency, predominantly affects the elderly and is exacerbated by risk factors like hypertension, atherosclerosis, and connective tissue disorders. Early detection using imaging modalities such as CT scans and emerging biomarkers is crucial for accurate diagnosis and reducing mortality rates. Treatment strategies differ based on the type of dissection, with open surgical repair typically preferred for Type A dissections, while endovascular repair is increasingly utilized for complex Type B cases, showing promise in decreasing long-term mortality rates for uncomplicated Type B dissections. The changing demographics may increase the burden of aortic dissections, presenting challenges to healthcare systems [<xref rid=""bb0020"" ref-type=""bibr"">4</xref>]. The categorization of aortic dissections according to tear location and aortic involvement is pivotal in guiding treatment decisions. Recent systems like the TEM system offer a comprehensive framework for this purpose. Aortic dissections result from heightened pressure leading to media layer separation, a process influenced by structural weaknesses and tension. Factors like Marfan syndrome and hypertension significantly contribute to aortic wall degeneration, highlighting the complex nature of the disease. Associated conditions such as aortic intramural hematomas and penetrating atherosclerotic aortic ulcers present unique challenges, impacting both prognosis and management [<xref rid=""bb0025"" ref-type=""bibr"">5</xref>]. Comprehending the etiology of aortic dissections, encompassing pathogenesis, classification, and emerging treatment modalities, is essential for enhancing patient outcomes and tackling the growing burden of this condition in clinical settings. Demographically, the International Registry of Acute Aortic Dissection (IRAD) indicates a predominance of Type A dissections (67 %) over Type B dissections (33 %), though regional demographic variations may influence these ratios [<xref rid=""bb0030"" ref-type=""bibr"">6</xref>]. Aortic dissections exhibit a male predilection with a male-to-female ratio of approximately 2:1 and typically occur in the elderly, with an average age of 63 years. Women diagnosed with aortic dissections are usually older than men and face poorer prognoses due to atypical presentations and delayed diagnoses. Hypertension emerges as a primary risk factor for aortic dissections, with smoking and dyslipidemia also significantly elevating the risk. Various predisposing conditions such as genetic disorders, inflammatory vasculitides, pregnancy, trauma, and stimulant abuse add to the complexity of aortic dissections [<xref rid=""bb0030"" ref-type=""bibr"">6</xref>]. A comprehensive grasp of the etiology, diagnostic tools, and predisposing conditions associated with aortic dissections is imperative for enhancing patient outcomes and navigating the escalating challenges posed by this condition in clinical practice. Marfan syndrome, an autosomal dominant connective tissue disorder primarily caused by mutations in the FBN1 gene, presents with systemic features including tall stature, arachnodactyly, and ocular and cardiovascular abnormalities. Aortic root dilation and dissection represent significant cardiovascular manifestations in Marfan syndrome, necessitating close monitoring and timely intervention to prevent catastrophic events [<xref rid=""bb0010"" ref-type=""bibr"">2</xref>,<xref rid=""bb0035"" ref-type=""bibr"">7</xref>,<xref rid=""bb0040"" ref-type=""bibr"">8</xref>]. Clinical symptomatology often manifests as acute, severe chest, back, or abdominal pain described as tearing or stabbing, accompanied by syncope and pulse deficits. Type B dissections may display back or abdominal pain migrating along the dissection path. Diagnostic tools play a crucial role in confirming suspicions of aortic dissections. While electrocardiograms (ECGs) are not diagnostic, they aid in excluding myocardial infarction, which can present similarly [<xref rid=""bb0045"" ref-type=""bibr"">9</xref>]. Imaging studies, including chest X-rays, CT scans, magnetic resonance angiography (MRA), and echocardiography, are pivotal in visualizing the site, size, and complications of the dissection. CT serves as the gold standard for diagnosing aortic dissections, providing detailed images of the intimal flap. Echocardiography, particularly transoesophageal echocardiography (TOE), offers comparable diagnostic accuracy to CT/MRA but requires skilled operators [<xref rid=""bb0050"" ref-type=""bibr"">10</xref>]. Laboratory investigations like D-dimer and C-reactive protein (CRP) levels offer additional insights into aortic dissections. Elevated D-dimer levels within the initial 24 h of a dissection exhibit high sensitivity and negative predictive value, aiding in early detection. CRP, an acute-phase reactant, acts as a prognostic marker for complications and mortality [<xref rid=""bb0055"" ref-type=""bibr"">11</xref>]. Surgical management of type A dissections involves meticulous steps like aortic clamping, repair, and anastomosis, with special considerations for Marfan syndrome patients. The extent of aortic arch replacement remains debatable, emphasizing the need for personalized care. Complications like malperfusion necessitate prompt interventions like coronary artery bypass grafting. Future research should focus on refining diagnostic tools, optimizing management strategies, and enhancing outcomes for patients with aortic dissections [<xref rid=""bb0020"" ref-type=""bibr"">4</xref>]. The exceptional rarity of the presented case does not lie in the coexistence of aortic dissection and Marfan syndrome, as these conditions often intersect,but rather in the extraordinary size of this Stanford type A dissection coupled with the absence of classical symptoms [<xref rid=""bb0025"" ref-type=""bibr"">5</xref>]. Aortic dissections, particularly when extensive and involving multiple segments of the aorta as seen in this case, typically present with acute and severe symptoms such as sudden-onset chest or back pain, syncope, and hemodynamic instability. The absence of overt symptoms In the face of such a massive aortic dissection challenges conventional clinical expectations and underscores the silent and insidious nature of certain cardiovascular emergencies. The asymptomatic course observed in this case raises intriguing questions about the adaptability of the cardiovascular system to accommodate substantial anatomical changes without overt clinical manifestations, highlighting the enigmatic nature of aortic pathology. The coalescence of aortic dissections with Marfan syndrome not only sheds light on the interplay of genetic mutations and structural vulnerabilities but also emphasizes the critical need for tailored monitoring and intervention strategies in high-risk populations. The enigmatic presentation observed in the exceptional case discussed herein, characterized by a massive aortic dissection devoid of classical symptoms, serves as a poignant reminder of the silent complexities that can underlie cardiovascular pathologies, urging a reevaluation of diagnostic paradigms and a heightened vigilance in clinical assessments. As we delve deeper into the realms of aortic pathology, future endeavors should be directed towards refining diagnostic modalities, optimizing therapeutic approaches, and unraveling the enigmatic intricacies of aortic dissections to pave the way for enhanced patient care and improved clinical outcomes in this challenging domain of cardiovascular medicine.

"Neonatal Marfan syndrome: a case report of a novel fibrillin 1 mutation, with genotype-phenotype correlation and brief review of the literature",,"Neonatal Marfan syndrome (nMFS) is a rare condition characterized by severe phenotype and poor prognosis, caused by mutations in the specific “neonatal region” of the fibrillin 1 gene (FBN1) [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR1"">1</xref>]. Prompt recognition of typical signs of neonatal presentation, such as characteristic facial anomalies with senile appearance, arthrogryposis, and campto-arachnodactyly, is fundamental for performing an early cardiological examination. This usually reveals rapidly progressive cardiovascular disease due to severe atrioventricular valve dysfunction. Herein, we report the case of an early-onset cardiac failure in a neonate with Marfan syndrome, with a brief review of the literature of cases with cardiac involvement in neonatal age. Clinical exome sequencing revealed a <italic toggle=""yes"">de novo</italic> missense variant of the FBN1 gene. Phenotype-genotype correlation led to a multidisciplinary diagnostic and management workflow. A female neonate spontaneously conceived was born in a 2nd-level hospital at 39 weeks of gestational age (GA), to a 32-year-old primigravida through spontaneous delivery. Oligohydramnios and multiple complex choroid cysts were noticed in the last two weeks of pregnancy. No invasive prenatal testing was performed. Family history revealed a first-degree cousin (from the paternal side) affected by <italic toggle=""yes"">de novo</italic> Baraitser-Winter syndrome, and a paternal aunt whose pregnancy was interrupted because of a not-specified chromosomal disorder. Apgar score was 8 and 9 at the 1st and 5th minutes, respectively. Birth weight was 2750 gr (16th centile, z-score: -1,01 SDS according to INeS charts [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR2"">2</xref>]), length 49 cm (47th centile, z-score: -0.07 SDS), and head circumference 35 cm (86th centile, z-score: 1.06 SDS). At birth, several dysmorphic features were noticed, including brachycephaly, triangular and asymmetric face with a typical “senile” appearance (Fig. <xref rid=""Fig1"" ref-type=""fig"">1</xref>.A) and hypertelorism, down-slanted palpebral fissures, blepharophimosis, blue sclerae, anteverted nares, narrow mouth, micrognathia, and low-set ear. A distal arthrogryposis of the upper (Fig. <xref rid=""Fig1"" ref-type=""fig"">1</xref>.B) and lower limbs and severe arachnodactyly of hands (Fig. <xref rid=""Fig1"" ref-type=""fig"">1</xref>.C) and feet were evident. In particular, the Steinberg sign (well-known as the “thumb” sign) was positive in both hands (Fig. <xref rid=""Fig1"" ref-type=""fig"">1</xref>.C).

 Cerebral ultrasound (CUS) performed within the first days of life confirmed multiple microcysts of the choroid plexus and increased echogenicity in the periventricular white matter. Brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed a dysplastic appearance of cerebellar vermis and hemispheres, with a markedly thickened cerebellar cortex and loss of normal arborization of white matter. Hypoxic-ischemic lesions were noticed in the right frontal area. Chest computed tomography (CT), performed because of respiratory distress, showed a right posterolateral diaphragmatic relaxation with ipsilateral atelectasis of lung tissue. Skeletal X-ray showed no significant malformations. Echocardiography within the first 5 days of life yielded patent foramen ovale and patent ductus arteriosus (both with left-to-right shunt), mild tricuspid insufficiency, and moderate mitral insufficiency. A mild dilatation of the aortic bulb was also observed. The neonate was admitted on the 15th day of life to our 3rd-level children’s hospital to perform a specialistic evaluation. Physical examination revealed fair general conditions with polypnea and mild dyspnea; a 3/6 systolic murmur was audible. Cardiomegaly and dilation of the left ventricle were detected by echocardiography, with a mild-to-moderate biventricular dysfunction. A severely dysplastic mitral valve showed severe multi-jet insufficiency (Fig. <xref rid=""Fig2"" ref-type=""fig"">2</xref>.A), and aortic valve showed mild insufficiency (Fig. <xref rid=""Fig2"" ref-type=""fig"">2</xref>.B) and moderate dilation of Valsalva sinuses. The right ventricle was mildly dilated, with mild-to-moderate insufficiency of the tricuspid valve, and a dysplastic pulmonary valve with moderate insufficiency was also observed. The ophthalmological examination did not reveal pathological signs. Multivalvular involvement required initial conservative medical treatment using intravenous furosemide (up to 3 mg/kg) associated with oral spironolactone and captopril. Medical treatment led to a gradual decreasing trend of brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) and troponin values. The baby was discharged in her 5th month of life.

 Blood karyotype and Chromosomal Microarray Analysis using platform Illumina<sup>®</sup> CytoSNP 850k showed no pathogenic results. After these negative results, at 2 months of life, clinical exome analysis of trios was performed on DNA extracted from circulating leukocytes using kit Twist Custom Panel (Twist Bioscience) on the Illumina sequencing platform (NovaSeq6000, San Diego, CA). Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) analysis identified the novel heterozygous <italic toggle=""yes"">de novo</italic> missense variant c.3152T > G in FBN1 gene (NM_000138.4), causing the aminoacidic change p.Phe1051Cys. The variant was never described in the literature; it was not on the Genome Aggregation Database (gnomAD) and was classified as probably pathogenetic (class 4) according to guidelines of the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics (ACMG) [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR3"">3</xref>]. Subsequently, severe feeding intolerance and gastroesophageal reflux led to progressive malnutrition and a significant impact on children’s physical growth; at the 6th month of life, the infant was admitted again to our hospital and required nutrition support through the placement of a percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) tube. Despite maximal medical treatment and PEG placement, the infant progressively developed symptoms of congestive heart failure resulting from severe multivalvular insufficiency. At about 7 months of life, she underwent cardiosurgical intervention with mitral valvuloplasty and the use of annuloplasty, tricuspid, and pulmonary valvuloplasty. Unfortunately, at 9 months and 19 days, the infant died of complications related to cardiac failure and severe malnutrition status (weight at death time 5070 gr, z-score: -3.04 according to WHO charts [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR4"">4</xref>]). In order to review the literature about cardiac involvement in neonatal Marfan syndrome and compare other cases to ours, an extensive literature search in the MEDLINE database (via PubMed) has been performed up to December 31st, 2022. The following keywords, “neonatal,” “Marfan,” and “syndrome,” were searched as entree terms as well. All 239 retrieved articles of the last 20 years were screened, and then full texts of records deemed eligible for inclusion were assessed. References in the relevant papers were also reviewed. Papers written in languages other than English were excluded. Papers reporting a full description of the cases were included. We systemically collected and summarized information on patients’ characteristics, cardiac involvement and procedures, and molecular findings. A brief review of the literature on nMFS cases with cardiac involvement in the last 20 years is displayed in Table <xref rid=""Tab1"" ref-type=""table"">1</xref> [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR1"">1</xref>, <xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR5"">5</xref>–<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR28"">28</xref>]. Beyond our case, we included other 27 cases, of whom three were born preterm. All 28 cases except one (reported by Postma et al.) had a birthweight greater than 2500 g. The mitral valve was involved in all cases, whereas the tricuspid valve was in 20/28 patients (71.4%). Aortic structures were involved in 23/28 cases (82.1%). Fifteen patients (53.6%) underwent cardiac procedures. FBN1 was the involved gene in all patients where a genetic diagnosis was available (21/28: 75%). Thirteen patients (46.4%) died at the time of writing.

 We compared the severe cardiac involvement of a neonate with Marfan syndrome to the cases available in the literature. Cardiac involvement is the main determinant in the prognosis of neonates with Marfan syndrome, and it is usually life-threatening. Severe valvular disease affecting mostly mitral and tricuspid valves quickly progresses to congestive heart failure and premature death within the first 2 years of life [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR1"">1</xref>, <xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR21"">21</xref>, <xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR22"">22</xref>, <xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR29"">29</xref>, <xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR30"">30</xref>]. Indeed, cardiac involvement in neonates is usually characterized by severe multivalvular insufficiency instead of aortic structures involvement, which is a typical feature in adults and older children [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR31"">31</xref>, <xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR32"">32</xref>]. Congenital pulmonary emphysema is also often detected in nMFS [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR33"">33</xref>]. Rarely, patients with nMFS may develop progressive but not fatal heart failure; some young adults have been described [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR34"">34</xref>]. Molecular analysis shows that most nMFS mutations are sporadic and occur in the so-called “neonatal region” of <italic toggle=""yes"">FBN1</italic> gene mapping between exons 24 and 32 [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR35"">35</xref>, <xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR36"">36</xref>]. In our case, we identified a novel missense variant, p.Phe1051Cys, located in exon 26 of the FBN1 gene inside the “neonatal critical region” that was not previously reported in the literature. Interesting genotype-phenotype associations for both cardiovascular and extra-cardiovascular manifestations were identified in the pediatric population [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR37"">37</xref>]. Previous studies and case reports demonstrated that mutations located in FBN1 “neonatal region” are usually associated with a rapidly worsening cardiac disease, poor response to medications [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR36"">36</xref>], and severe congestive heart failure, which represent the main cause of early death. In particular, patients carrying variants in a specific region (amino acids 1028–1088, corresponding to exon 25 and a few residues from exon 26) show a worse prognosis with heart failure-related death within the first year of life, irrespective of gender [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR38"">38</xref>]. Early genotype analysis and prompt phenotype recognition can potentially drive accurate genetic counseling. Indeed, the prompt recognition of a typical phenotype such as that of Marfan syndrome should lead to a detailed evaluation and close follow-up of cardiac morphology and function. Timely diagnosis is increasingly important in looking for genotype-phenotype characterization and improving early therapeutic strategies. Despite their low quantity in skeletal matrices, MFS causes severe skeletal defects, highlighting the importance of fibrillin-1 and microfibrils in bone formation and function [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR39"">39</xref>]. The extent of musculoskeletal disease is quite significant in older patients with Marfan syndrome: scoliosis, pectus deformity, and deformity of the foot. Many will need a specific follow-up, requiring corrective surgery during their life span [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR40"">40</xref>]. Similarly, fibrillin-1-containing microfibrils are ubiquitous in the normal eye. Ectopia lentis in MFS patients is likely caused by an FBN1 mutation that prevents fibrillin-1 production. If they survive, MFS patients experience different ocular features depending on the mutation and severity of the illness. Patients with MFS typically acquire lenticular and/or axial myopia before the age of ten and should see an ophthalmologist to examine their near-sightedness [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR39"">39</xref>]. Multi-disciplinary evaluation based on genotype-phenotype correlations of nMFS cases is essential to determine the best medical and surgical approach, predict the relevant impact on patient prognosis, and adequately counsel their families. MFS is an example of a syndrome where an early personalized approach to address a dynamic, genetically determined condition can make a difference in outcome [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR41"">41</xref>]. In light of this, a careful evaluation of all clinical signs by neonatologists is mandatory: in particular, the Steinberg sign (also known as the thumb sign) presence should be considered a potential handle sign for diagnostic suspicion, and every neonatologist should rule out Marfan syndrome in cases like this. This can be useful to perform a correct differential diagnosis, like, for example, with distal arthrogryposis syndromes or other congenital defects with cardiac involvement, with the aim of timely reaching the correct diagnosis [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR42"">42</xref>, <xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR43"">43</xref>]. The current databases should be updated with the genomic and phenotypic findings of the present patient in order to provide a better characterization of such a rare disease. Additional patients and the identification of new mutations will increase the knowledge of the molecular bases and the pathogenic mechanisms underlying Marfan syndrome with neonatal onset. Finally, clinicians must be aware of the possibility that neonates may have a severely poor outcome, even in the absence of symptoms in the first weeks of life.",N/A,18 9 2024
The Contribution of Mast Cells to the Regulation of Elastic Fiber Tensometry in the Skin Dermis of Children with Marfan Syndrome,"Marfan syndrome (MFS) is a hereditary condition accompanied by disorders in the structural and regulatory properties of connective tissue, including elastic fibers, due to a mutation in the gene encodes for fibrillin-1 protein (FBN1 gene) and the synthesis of abnormal fibrillin-1 glycoprotein. Despite the high potential of mast cells (MCs) to remodel the extracellular matrix (ECM), their pathogenetic significance in MFS has not been considered yet. The group of patients with Marfan syndrome included two mothers and five children (three girls aged 4, 11, and 11 and two boys aged 12 and 13). Normal skin was examined in two children aged 11 and 12. Histochemical, monoplex, and multiplex immunohistochemical techniques; combined protocols of simultaneous histochemical and immunohistochemical staining (the results of staining were assessed using light, epifluorescence, and confocal microscopy); and bioinformatics algorithms for the quantitative analysis of detected targets were used to evaluate mast cells and their relationship with other cells from extracellular structures in the skin dermis. Analysis of the skin MC population in children with Marfan syndrome revealed a considerably increased number of intra-organic populations with the preservation of the specific Tryptase<sup>+</sup>Chymase<sup>+</sup>CPA3<sup>+</sup> protease profile typical of the skin. The features of the MC histotopography phenotype in MFS consisted of closer colocalization with elastic fibers, smooth muscle cells, and fibroblasts. MCs formed many intradermal clusters that synchronized the activity of cell functions in the stromal landscape of the tissue microenvironment with the help of spatial architectonics, including the formation of cell chains and the creation of fibrous niches. In MCs, the expression of specific proteases, TGF-β, and heparin increased, with targeted secretion of biologically active substances relative to the dermal elastic fibers, which had specific structural features in MFS, including abnormal variability in thickness along their entire length, alternating thickened and thinned areas, and uneven surface topography. This paper discusses the potential role of MCs in strain analysis (tensometry) of the tissue microenvironment in MFS. Thus, the quantitative and qualitative rearrangements of the skin MC population in MFS are aimed at altering the stromal landscape of the connective tissue. The results obtained should be taken into account when managing clinical signs of MFS manifested in other pathogenetically critical structures of internal organs, including the aorta, tendons, cartilage, and parenchymal organs.","Marfan syndrome (MFS), described a little over 100 years ago, is one of the first conditions classified as an inherited connective tissue disorder. The prevalence of MFS is 1 per 3000–5000 people in the overall population, with an autosomal dominant type of inheritance [<xref rid=""B1-ijms-25-09191"" ref-type=""bibr"">1</xref>]. MFS is based on mutations in the gene encodes for the fibrillin-1 glycoprotein–<italic toggle=""yes"">FBN1</italic> gene (15q21.1). Fibrillin-1 is localized in the extracellular matrix (ECM) of the connective tissue, forming microfibrils, and it is an essential element in the processing and physiology of elastic fibers. Fibrillin-1 monomers form a structure that helps generate mature elastic fibers from tropoelastin [<xref rid=""B2-ijms-25-09191"" ref-type=""bibr"">2</xref>]. In these circumstances, microfibrils act as a scaffold for elastin and support the assembly process with the formation of a functional architecture of elastic fibers [<xref rid=""B3-ijms-25-09191"" ref-type=""bibr"">3</xref>,<xref rid=""B4-ijms-25-09191"" ref-type=""bibr"">4</xref>]. Elastic fibers provide the ECM with plasticity and resistance to stress in the skin, blood vessel membranes, ligaments, tendons, cartilage, the “soft skeletons” of parenchymal organs, and other structures. Differences found in the skin of most patients with MFS are primarily related to a decreased number of fibrillin-1 microfibrils. In the fibroblasts of children with neonatal MFS, microfibril shortening and fragmentation have been detected [<xref rid=""B5-ijms-25-09191"" ref-type=""bibr"">5</xref>]. Research investigating fibroblasts has provided findings on decreased synthesis, secretion, and integration of fibrillin-1 into the ECM in MFS [<xref rid=""B6-ijms-25-09191"" ref-type=""bibr"">6</xref>]. Simulations of the condition in laboratory rodents have demonstrated a decreased density of elastic fibers and the disorganization of microfibrils in the cornea of mice. In addition to its structural relevance, fibrillin-1 has a regulatory function, affecting the storage, release, and activation of transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-β), which, in turn, exhibits a wide range of biological effects [<xref rid=""B7-ijms-25-09191"" ref-type=""bibr"">7</xref>,<xref rid=""B8-ijms-25-09191"" ref-type=""bibr"">8</xref>,<xref rid=""B9-ijms-25-09191"" ref-type=""bibr"">9</xref>]. Mast cells (MCs) are part of innate immunity, and their involvement in the initiation and pathogenesis of allergic diseases is well documented in numerous studies [<xref rid=""B10-ijms-25-09191"" ref-type=""bibr"">10</xref>,<xref rid=""B11-ijms-25-09191"" ref-type=""bibr"">11</xref>,<xref rid=""B12-ijms-25-09191"" ref-type=""bibr"">12</xref>]. However, the physiological and pathological implications of MCs extend far beyond the realization of both innate and specific immunity [<xref rid=""B13-ijms-25-09191"" ref-type=""bibr"">13</xref>,<xref rid=""B14-ijms-25-09191"" ref-type=""bibr"">14</xref>,<xref rid=""B15-ijms-25-09191"" ref-type=""bibr"">15</xref>]. As it is known, MCs are crucial in fibrosis and ECM remodeling [<xref rid=""B16-ijms-25-09191"" ref-type=""bibr"">16</xref>,<xref rid=""B17-ijms-25-09191"" ref-type=""bibr"">17</xref>,<xref rid=""B18-ijms-25-09191"" ref-type=""bibr"">18</xref>], indicating the involvement of connective tissue homeostasis in the pathogenesis under MFS. MCs participate in the creation of profibrogenic tissue niches, in which favorable conditions for the development of fibrotic changes are formed. The presence of specific proteases in mast cells—tryptase, chymase, and carboxypeptidase A3—and other components of the secretome with high biological activity, including TGF-β, allows providing conditions for the disassembly of fibrous structures and fibrillogenesis to process new fibrous elements adequately relative to existing conditions [<xref rid=""B18-ijms-25-09191"" ref-type=""bibr"">18</xref>]. Notably, the processes of fiber degradation and neoformation with MC participation can be implemented simultaneously, giving MCs the sculptor role of a specific tissue microenvironment [<xref rid=""B14-ijms-25-09191"" ref-type=""bibr"">14</xref>,<xref rid=""B18-ijms-25-09191"" ref-type=""bibr"">18</xref>]. The synthesis of a large number of cytokines and growth factors enables MCs to actively influence the collagen- and elastin-producing elements of connective tissue, adapting the composition of the ECM to function under certain environmental conditions [<xref rid=""B19-ijms-25-09191"" ref-type=""bibr"">19</xref>,<xref rid=""B20-ijms-25-09191"" ref-type=""bibr"">20</xref>]. This role of MCs is clearly manifested in wound regeneration at each of the healing phases, including inflammation, proliferation, and remodeling. MC activation, with the release of pre-formed or de novo synthesized mediators, including histamine, specific proteases, VEGF, IL-6, IL-8, bFGF, NGF, and PDGF, results in alterations in capillary permeability, vasodilation, and directed migration of granulocytes, lymphocytes, monocytes, and macrophages. It also stimulates the division and increased biosynthetic activity of fibroblasts, results in an increased number of myofibroblasts, enhances collagen synthesis, and promotes neoangiogenesis [<xref rid=""B14-ijms-25-09191"" ref-type=""bibr"">14</xref>]. Thus, the fact that MCs are involved in the pathogenesis of MFS at the level of the stromal landscape of a specific tissue microenvironment can be promising in terms of pharmacological targets. Moreover, in MFS, abnormal microfibrils are to some extent deprived of the function of structural tissue “tensometers”, modifying the ability of both stromal and immunocompetent cells of the dermis to adequately monitor the state of the integrative buffer metabolic environment, including responses to mechanical and gravitational exposure. Since MCs have been found in close contact with elastic fibers under a number of pathophysiological conditions [<xref rid=""B21-ijms-25-09191"" ref-type=""bibr"">21</xref>,<xref rid=""B22-ijms-25-09191"" ref-type=""bibr"">22</xref>], and they synthesize enzymes capable of causing elastic fiber remodeling, including elastase and cathepsin G [<xref rid=""B23-ijms-25-09191"" ref-type=""bibr"">23</xref>,<xref rid=""B24-ijms-25-09191"" ref-type=""bibr"">24</xref>,<xref rid=""B25-ijms-25-09191"" ref-type=""bibr"">25</xref>,<xref rid=""B26-ijms-25-09191"" ref-type=""bibr"">26</xref>,<xref rid=""B27-ijms-25-09191"" ref-type=""bibr"">27</xref>,<xref rid=""B28-ijms-25-09191"" ref-type=""bibr"">28</xref>], we could assume their specific biological features in Marfan syndrome. Since we could not find research investigating MCs under this hereditary condition, the aim of our study is not only to investigate the features of the MC population in Marfan syndrome for the first time but also to evaluate the potential role of MCs in the tensometry of the local tissue microenvironment in the skin dermis as one of the essential functions of elastic fibers.  As reported, since the skin may be a window into the hereditary diseases of connective tissue [<xref rid=""B29-ijms-25-09191"" ref-type=""bibr"">29</xref>], the study of its cellular component in MFS is absolutely reasonable. Concurrently, MCs are a critical unit of analysis in hereditary pathologies affecting connective tissues due to their known high potential to regulate local homeostasis. The study of the molecular portrait of MCs can specify how mutations in the FBN1 gene affect changes in the stromal and immune landscapes. In some specified sense, MCs are one of the key sculptors of the connective tissue phenotype, including that in MFS. Furthermore, it can be assumed that in MFS, the revealed patterns of MCs in the skin dermis may be typical of connective tissue in other organs because differences in the macromolecular structure of microfibrils affect all body structures. The elastic network of the skin consists of bundles of microfibrils (oxytalan fibers) emerging from the dermo-epithelial junction into the dermis, where they interact with thin elastin-containing fibers (elaunin fibers) and form a network of thick-caliber elastic fibers in the deeper layers of the dermis. Notably, microfibrils in the composition of elastic fibers are considered structural “tensometers”. Their conformational changes during mechanical stretching can indirectly modify the migration, functional activity, and differentiation of cells through integrin receptors [<xref rid=""B3-ijms-25-09191"" ref-type=""bibr"">3</xref>]. In this aspect, the effect of MCs on the elastic component of the dermis is of particular interest since the targeted secretory activity relative to elastic fibers primarily results in contact of the secretome, including heparin and specific proteases, with fibrillin-1 and microfibrils. This is why the issue of the MC’s potential to compensate for the lost natural interstitial tensinometry of elastic fibers by forming spatial clusters in the connective tissue base of the skin deserves further study. Indeed, the microscopic patterns detected support a more active formation of functional ensembles in MFS than the norm. This process captures wide areas of the skin and synchronizes a larger number of cells from both the immune and stromal landscapes. In addition, the issue of the MC effect on elastic fibers deserves special attention. The degrading MC effects on elastic fibers are known and have been demonstrated in a few studies with respect to elastinopathy, particularly mid-dermal elastolysis, which is characterized by selective loss of elastic fibers in the middle part of the skin dermis [<xref rid=""B21-ijms-25-09191"" ref-type=""bibr"">21</xref>]. Close colocalization of degranulating MCs with fragmented elastic fibers has been observed at the ultrastructural level in skin striae atrophicae formation [<xref rid=""B22-ijms-25-09191"" ref-type=""bibr"">22</xref>]. Notably, elastic fibers were disorganized, had uneven edges and/or signs of elastolysis, and lost the specific peripheral localization of microfilaments [<xref rid=""B22-ijms-25-09191"" ref-type=""bibr"">22</xref>]. In our studies, we observed patterns of changes in the relief of elastic fibers at the light-optical level. Nonetheless, the theoretical potential of MCs to degrade elastic fibers is supported by their production of corresponding enzymes, including elastase and cathepsin G [<xref rid=""B23-ijms-25-09191"" ref-type=""bibr"">23</xref>,<xref rid=""B24-ijms-25-09191"" ref-type=""bibr"">24</xref>,<xref rid=""B25-ijms-25-09191"" ref-type=""bibr"">25</xref>,<xref rid=""B26-ijms-25-09191"" ref-type=""bibr"">26</xref>,<xref rid=""B27-ijms-25-09191"" ref-type=""bibr"">27</xref>,<xref rid=""B28-ijms-25-09191"" ref-type=""bibr"">28</xref>]. The active secretion of tryptase, chymase, CPA3, and heparin directly onto elastic fibers, which we observed, may support their direct involvement in the metabolism of the fibrous component of the skin dermis. However, in this regard, a natural question arises regarding the absence of significant changes in the relative ratio of elastic to collagen fibers. We detected a decrease in the relative content of elastic fibers in the skin dermis of only two patients. Moreover, our findings are not consistent with the findings detected in mice under simulated MFS: A significant decrease in the bulk density of elastin and collagen and a thinner skin dermis were found [<xref rid=""B30-ijms-25-09191"" ref-type=""bibr"">30</xref>]. This may be due to differences in the pathogenesis of MFS between humans and laboratory animals and the severity of genetic pathology manifestations in MFS. In addition, one can argue the MC’s potential to re-synthesize elastic fibers after their degradation into specific structural and molecular units that can subsequently be used to assemble new elastic fibers. This fact could explain the absence of a significant decrease in the integral area of elastic fibers in biopsy skin sections. Previously, we studied the potential of MCs to participate in collagen fibrillogenesis due to direct and indirect effects [<xref rid=""B18-ijms-25-09191"" ref-type=""bibr"">18</xref>,<xref rid=""B31-ijms-25-09191"" ref-type=""bibr"">31</xref>]. This speculation can be applied to explain the mechanisms of elastic fiber remodeling since the effect of heparan sulfate (and possibly heparin) on the activity of the fibrillin-1 molecule’s interaction during linear microfibril polymerization is known [<xref rid=""B3-ijms-25-09191"" ref-type=""bibr"">3</xref>,<xref rid=""B32-ijms-25-09191"" ref-type=""bibr"">32</xref>,<xref rid=""B33-ijms-25-09191"" ref-type=""bibr"">33</xref>]. The similarity between heparan sulfate and heparin enhances the potential of MCs in elastic fiber processing. Although MCs and basophils are two major sources of heparin in humans, MCs—according to their prolonged presence and abundance in the skin—are considered the main producers of heparin in the skin [<xref rid=""B34-ijms-25-09191"" ref-type=""bibr"">34</xref>,<xref rid=""B35-ijms-25-09191"" ref-type=""bibr"">35</xref>,<xref rid=""B36-ijms-25-09191"" ref-type=""bibr"">36</xref>]. In this aspect, an increased number of MCs can be considered as a compensatory reaction associated with the need to create additional ECM strength. On the other hand, the role of MCs in developing fibrotic changes should be taken into account. In particular, as demonstrated, the formation of fibrous niches in skeletal muscles is due to mutations in the FBN1 gene in MFS; this results in an increased accumulation of collagen fibers and fibroblasts [<xref rid=""B37-ijms-25-09191"" ref-type=""bibr"">37</xref>]. As stated, there is histological evidence of myocardial fibrosis in mice with MFS and an increase in diffuse myocardial fibrosis biomarkers in children and adolescents with MFS [<xref rid=""B38-ijms-25-09191"" ref-type=""bibr"">38</xref>]. A patient with MFS is reported to develop extensive fibrosis after radiation therapy [<xref rid=""B39-ijms-25-09191"" ref-type=""bibr"">39</xref>]. In the aorta of patients with MFS, increased expression of contractile protein markers, including α-SMA; accumulation of type I collagen; fragmentation; loss or proliferation of interlaminar elastic fibers; and accumulation of acid mucopolysaccharides have been detected [<xref rid=""B40-ijms-25-09191"" ref-type=""bibr"">40</xref>,<xref rid=""B41-ijms-25-09191"" ref-type=""bibr"">41</xref>]. Since MFS represents the pathobiology of fibrillin-1, it should be expected that both the architecture of intercellular interactions and the mechanisms of interaction with the components of the ECM are to be disturbed to a certain extent. Dysfunctional fibrillin-1 fails to form latent TGF-β-binding protein (LTBP) and accumulates TGF-β in the ECM, resulting in an increased release of the latter [<xref rid=""B42-ijms-25-09191"" ref-type=""bibr"">42</xref>,<xref rid=""B43-ijms-25-09191"" ref-type=""bibr"">43</xref>]. After release, TGF-β interacts with the TGF-β receptor family, resulting in the regulation of physiological processes such as angiogenesis, cell proliferation, differentiation, apoptosis, and the regeneration and remodeling of the structure and composition of the ECM [<xref rid=""B44-ijms-25-09191"" ref-type=""bibr"">44</xref>,<xref rid=""B45-ijms-25-09191"" ref-type=""bibr"">45</xref>,<xref rid=""B46-ijms-25-09191"" ref-type=""bibr"">46</xref>,<xref rid=""B47-ijms-25-09191"" ref-type=""bibr"">47</xref>]. As demonstrated, TGF-β has the potential to induce excessive collagen formation and elastic fiber degradation and enhance the proliferation and migration of smooth muscle cells [<xref rid=""B48-ijms-25-09191"" ref-type=""bibr"">48</xref>,<xref rid=""B49-ijms-25-09191"" ref-type=""bibr"">49</xref>]. Our findings support increased synthesis of TGF-β in MCs. Furthermore, it should be noted that MCs start to actively deliver the growth factor to tissue targets, thus apparently compensating for its absence in tissue depots (niches). This apparently forces an increased synthesis of TGF-β in MCs; moreover, to improve its functional value without storage, MCs can migrate directly to tissue (cellular) targets, which is followed by growth factor secretion (<xref rid=""ijms-25-09191-f008"" ref-type=""fig"">Figure 8</xref>d). The increased representation of MCs with positive expression of CD117 allows us to conclude that, in MFS, the MC population has a great potential for further differentiation, growth, survival, and high functional activity. The increased number of MCs is a sign of their active participation in the metabolism of the stromal landscape of the skin dermis in MFS. In addition, this fact should be considered as a certain basis for developing distorted immune responses in MFS and a specific response to external and internal stimuli. Active secretory activity, including specific proteases, emphasizes the role of the ECM in developing the fibrous background in response to the decreased strength of the elastic component. In terms of the above, the compensatory functions of MCs turn into pathological ones; this can explain the developing fibrosis in other organs, as demonstrated in a number of studies [<xref rid=""B37-ijms-25-09191"" ref-type=""bibr"">37</xref>,<xref rid=""B38-ijms-25-09191"" ref-type=""bibr"">38</xref>,<xref rid=""B39-ijms-25-09191"" ref-type=""bibr"">39</xref>,<xref rid=""B40-ijms-25-09191"" ref-type=""bibr"">40</xref>,<xref rid=""B41-ijms-25-09191"" ref-type=""bibr"">41</xref>].  In MFS, skin MCs are actively involved in the connective tissue metabolism of the dermis. An increase in the number of MCs with increased targeted secretion of specific proteases to elastic fibers is one of the compensatory reaction mechanisms that neutralize the violated bioinformatic and spatial functions of abnormal fibrillin-1. The formation of profibrotic MCs in MFS causes parenchymal damage in other organs; this should be taken into account when managing patients according to personalized medicine.",N/A,24 8 2024
Safety and efficacy of the Yamane technique for intraocular three-piece lens implantation in Egyptian patients diagnosed with Marfan syndrome: a retrospective study,,"Marfan syndrome (MFS) is classified as an autosomal dominant connective tissue disorder, with an estimated prevalence of 1 in 5,000 individuals. This condition is characterized by complete penetrance, variable expressivity within and between families, and pleiotropic effects. Notably, it does not exhibit a preference for any specific gender, race, ethnicity, or geographic region [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR1"">1</xref>]. MFS is caused by a mutation of the fibrillin-1 (FBN1) protein gene, affecting the elasticity and strength of connective tissues. This mutation leads to disordered and decreased incorporation of fibrillin into the connective tissue matrix. Ocular structures rich in fibrillin include the cornea, suspensory zonules of the lens, lens capsule, and sclera [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR2"">2</xref>]. Ectopia lentis (EL) is one of the cardinal features of MFS, observed in approximately 60% of affected individuals. This condition arises from the weakness of the ciliary zonules, which serve as the suspensory ligaments of the lens. Myopia is one of the most common ocular features in MFS patients, affecting 34–44% of individuals with MFS and often progressing rapidly during childhood. Additional ocular manifestations may include increased axial length of the globe and corneal flattening. Studies have also revealed associations with strabismus, including exotropia and esotropia, vertical deviations, primary inferior oblique muscle overaction and glaucoma [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR3"">3</xref>]. Retinal detachment (RD) also is reported in about 15% of patients with MFS [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR4"">4</xref>]. For mild cases of EL associated with MFS, the initial treatment typically consists of spectacles or contact lenses. However, it is noteworthy that approximately 50% of these cases may progress to amblyopia. The surgical management of these conditions is complicated by the presence of zonular weakness. In the past, patients undergoing lensectomy and vitrectomy were often left aphakic. Advancements in surgical technology and intraocular lens (IOL) designs have introduced a variety of options, including angle-supported anterior chamber IOLs, sulcus-fixated IOLs, iris-claw IOLs, iris-sutured IOLs, and scleral-fixated posterior chamber IOLs (SFIOL) [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR5"">5</xref>]. Due to the high prevalence of high myopia in patients with MFS, which highlights the need to conduct regular, long-term and precise fundus examinations for these patients, particularly when surgery is performed at a young age, it is not advisable to use IOL implants that affect mydriasis, such as posterior iris-claw IOLs [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR6"">6</xref>]. The advantages of SFIOL implantation are manifold, including minimal damage to the corneal endothelial cells, iris, and anterior chamber angle structures, alongside a reduced risk of secondary glaucoma and recurrent uveitis [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR7"">7</xref>]. In this technique, the haptics of the IOL can be externalized and anchored within the sclera without requiring sutures. Some methodologies incorporate the use of scleral flaps or scleral tunnels that are aligned parallel to the limbus. The externalization of the haptics can be performed with forceps or needles, and the closure of the scleral flaps can be executed using 10–0 nylon or fibrin glue [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR8"">8</xref>]. Since its introduction in 2014, the Yamane technique (flanged intrascleral haptic fixation with double-needle technique /FIHFT) has gained significant traction, eliminating the necessity for conjunctival peritomy or scleral flaps. This method involves the externalization of the haptics of a three-piece IOL through a 27-gauge (G) needle, followed by cauterization to form bulbs at the haptic ends, thereby enhancing stability within the scleral tunnels [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR9"">9</xref>]. This research aimed to investigate the clinical results and possible complications linked to the application of the Yamane technique (FIHFT) in Egyptian patients diagnosed with MFS who exhibited EL. This research was a retrospective single-armed cohort study involving thirty-three Egyptian patients diagnosed with MFS who had subluxated lenses, with data collected between April 2019 and January 2024. Within this group, seven individuals revealed bilateral subluxation, leading to the examination of a total of forty eyes. The study was conducted in the ethical guidelines of the Declaration of Helsinki and received approval from the Research Ethics Committee of the Faculty of Medicine at Beni Suef University (Approval No: FMBSUREC/07072024/Taha). Written informed consent was obtained from all patients or their legal guardians of young patients participating in the research. Patients were excluded from the study based on several criteria: those diagnosed with MFS lacking lens subluxation, individuals with lens subluxation resulting from conditions other than MFS, patients with retinal vascular issues and macular diseases, MFS patients exhibiting preoperative lattice degeneration and retinal detachment, and those who had a history of another ocular surgery. Each patient underwent a comprehensive ophthalmological assessment, which encompassed evaluations of uncorrected distant visual acuity (UCDVA), corrected distant visual acuity (CDVA), refractive status of the eyes, slit-lamp examination (Fig. <xref rid=""Fig1"" ref-type=""fig"">1</xref>), and a thorough fundus examination utilizing slit-lamp bio-microscopy with + 90 diopter (D) fundus lens (Volk Opticals, Mentor, OH, USA) or indirect ophthalmoscopy. Preoperative biometry was performed using IOL Master 500/700 (Carl Zeiss Meditec, Oberkochen, Germany), and the IOL power was calculated using the SRK/T formula. The target for the postoperative refraction was a spherical refractive power of -0.50 D. Subsequent follow-up evaluations included measurements of UCDVA, CDVA, eye refraction, slit-lamp examination, and fundus assessment.<fig id=""Fig1""><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>Slit-lamp examination showed crystalline lens subluxation (ectopia lentis) in Egyptian patients diagnosed with Marfan syndrome. <bold>a</bold> superior temporal subluxation with intact zonules. <bold>b</bold> inferior temporal subluxation with intact zonules</p></caption><graphic http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink href=""12886_2024_3724_Fig1_HTML"" id=""MO1""></graphic></fig>  The Yamane technique is a sophisticated method of IOL fixation that circumvents the need for sutures, glue, and scleral or conjunctival dissection [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR10"">10</xref>]. In our study, we assessed the utilization of the Yamane technique in Egyptian patients diagnosed with MFS presented with EL. The study showed a significant improvement in the visual outcomes as demonstrated by the significant reduction of sphere measurements from -9.0 ± 1.4 D before the operation to -1.4 ± 0.7 D after the procedure. Also, the cylinder measurements decreased significantly from -4.5 ± 0.8 D preoperatively to -1.4 ± 0.6 D postoperatively. A marked reduction of the SEQ was also observed from -11.4 ± 1.5 D to -2.1 ± 0.8 D. The CDVA log MAR was increased significantly after the operation from 0.80 ± 0.32 to 0.18 ± 0.10. The findings from our recent study on postoperative complications indicated that IOL decentration was the most common complication, affecting five eyes (12.5%). This was followed by vitreous hemorrhage in 3 eyes (7.5%). Additionally, IOLslippage, IOL tilt, and RD were each observed in 2 eyes (5%). Although the statistical analysis did not demonstrate significant differences in the types of complications concerning patients age (possibly due to the small cohort) there was a clinically significant observation, as IOL tilt and slippage occurred at mean ages of 18 and 19 years, respectively. The Yamane technique has gained popularity worldwide, and several modifications have been described. It has now become preferred approach for IOL fixation when there is no adequate capsular support for a traditional IOL. It seems to be a quite an easy and fast procedure in the hands of an experienced surgeon, with a short learning curve. It is a minimally invasive method of IOL intrascleral fixation [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR11"">11</xref>]. Our study corroborates the findings of Tao et al. (Table <xref rid=""Tab5"" ref-type=""table"">5</xref>), who investigated FIHFT effects in MFS patients, the only previous research on this topic precisely. They reported significant improvements in postoperative UCDVA and CDVA. Specifically, preoperative CDVA averaged 0.49 ± 0.20 log MAR, increasing to 0.21 ± 0.14 log MAR postoperatively, with a statistically significant change of 0.28 ± 0.20 (<italic toggle=""yes"">P</italic> < 0.001). In contrast, Tao et al. reported a higher incidence of postoperative iris capture, affecting six eyes (38.9%), which managed using a 30-G needle in one case and mydriatics in five cases. Despite their efforts to prevent recurrence with miotics, the outcomes were disappointing, with iris capture recurring in five eyes during follow-up [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR12"">12</xref>]. Their study has a few limitations that are worth noting. Firstly, their follow-up period was shorter, and the size of the group they studied was smaller compared to the scope of our research. Additionally, unlike in our study, they did not specify whether the surgeries were performed by multiple surgeons or a single surgeon. Furthermore, they did not gather information on the refractive status of all eyes in their study.

Randerson et al. studied the clinical outcomes of the Yamane technique for various indications, finding that the most common postoperative complication was a transient increase in IOP in 19 eyes (15.7%). Recurrent protrusion of the flanged haptic occurred in 11 eyes (9.1%). Other complications included CME in 7 eyes (5.8%) and corneal oedema in 6 eyes (5.0%). Rare complications included vitreous hemorrhage (4 eyes, 3.3%), hyphema (2 eyes, 1.65%), transient hypotony (4 eyes, 3.3%), and reverse pupillary block (4 eyes, 3.3%). Severe complications were noted in 11 eyes (9.1%), with six eyes (5.0%) requiring further surgery [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR14"">14</xref>]. Guerin et al. studied the functional outcomes of the Yamane technique versus the retro-pupillary iris-claw technique. In the Yamane group (<italic toggle=""yes"">n</italic> = 58), the most common early complication was increased IOP in 12 patients (21%). Corneal oedema occurred in 2 patients (4%), and 7 (12%) experienced IOL dislocation or tilt requiring repositioning. Hemorrhagic events were noted in 5 patients (9%), all resolving without intervention. Late complications included CME in 8 patients (14%), glaucoma progression in 6 patients (10%), and three cases of RD. No cases of pupillary block, corneal decompensation, endophthalmitis, or choroidal effusion were reported [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR15"">15</xref>]. Safran and colleagues identified factors contributing to IOL tilt and decentration in the Yamane technique. Unequal needle tunnel lengths, improper positioning relative to the limbus, and inadequate haptic flange creation can lead to lens tilt and displacement, causing refractive errors and astigmatism that impair visual quality. To reduce these risks, proper instrumentation and careful surgical techniques are essential [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR16"">16</xref>]. In our study, we found that the most common complication was IOL decentration, which affected five eyes (12.5%) and was observed on the first day after surgery. As the IOL decentration was observed only after pupil dilation and did not affect vision, no intervention was necessary. We hypothesize that MFS is a genetic connective tissue disorder that causes elastic fibres to behave abnormally, particularly after eye surgeries such as anterior vitrectomy, which can affect IOP. However, we do not have evidence from the literature to support this theory regarding MFS. The results of our study suggest that the occurrence of IOL tilt and slippage in individuals aged 18 and 19 years can be linked to the increased scleral elasticity found in younger populations. The human sclera reaches its maximum size and elasticity between the ages of 12 and 13 years, after which there is a progressive reduction in compliance and a corresponding rise in rigidity [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR17"">17</xref>]. In young patients, particularly those with thin sclera and low scleral rigidity, such as in the case of MFS, the flexibility of the sclera is extremely important when considering the fixation of an IOL within it [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR13"">13</xref>]. Risk factors for RD in MFS include younger age, EL, and aphakia. RD can also occur as a complication of surgery to remove a dislocated lens. While significant lenticular displacement and severe axial myopia increase RD risk after vitreo-lensectomy, modern surgical techniques have greatly reduced this complication [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR18"">18</xref>]. This study's strengths include its execution at a single location with a homogeneous ethnic group and consistent surgical procedures by the same surgeon. However, limitations include a small patient cohort that may hinder statistical analysis and a non-comparative retrospective design that poses challenges due to incomplete documentation. Further large-scale prospective research is needed to better understand the safety and efficacy of the Yamani technique for managing MFS eyes with EL. The Yamane technique has demonstrated both efficacy and safety in the management of subluxated lenses among Egyptian individuals diagnosed with Marfan Syndrome. This approach has led to enhancements in visual acuity while maintaining a low incidence of complications, which are predominantly minor and manageable. It is crucial to conduct thorough fundus examinations before and following the surgical procedure to swiftly detect any retinal breaks, thereby minimizing the likelihood of retinal detachment. IOL tilting, and slippage tend to be more prevalent in younger patients.

Rare locations of peripheral aneurysms in Marfan syndrome treated surgically: a case report,Marfan syndrome (MFS) is a connective tissue disorder that can lead to cardiovascular and musculoskeletal abnormalities. Aortic aneurysms and dissections are frequently seen in patients with MFS whereas peripheral vascular aneurysms in subclavian and axillary arteries territory considered very unusual. We reported a case of 54-year-old female with known history of MFS who had undergone a mechanical valve Bentall procedure due to severe aortic regurgitation and ascending aorta aneurysm in addition to thoracoabdominal aortic repair and who presented with a pulsatile painful mass in her right axillary region that turn to be significant true aneurysms of right subclavian and axillary arteries. To relive symptoms and to avoid further complications patient underwent successful surgical repair. Our case demonstrated rare locations of true peripheral aneurysms as a possible manifestation of MFS appeared several years post Bentall procedure and thoracoabdominal aortic repair and highlights also the importance of long-term monitoring to detect earlier such manifestation and avoid complications by surgical repair.,"Marfan syndrome (MFS) is an autosomal dominant disease of connective tissue that poses high penetrance and variable expression with incidence of 2–3 per 10,000 individuals and caused mostly by mutation in the gene encoding fibrillin-1. Clinically MFS manifesting by affecting several organ systems including skeleton, eyes, heart, lung and blood vessels [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR1"">1</xref>–<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR4"">4</xref>]. Among numerous manifestations of MFS, cardiovascular abnormalities are considered as the most prevalent complications and account for 90% of death in these patients [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR5"">5</xref>, <xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR6"">6</xref>]. While Aneurysms and dissections of the aorta are prevalent complications of this condition, peripheral aneurysms are less common in patients with MFS. In one study, a distal/peripheral arterial aneurysms were found in approximately one-third of adults with MFS. In the same study between 44 cases of distal or peripheral aneurysms 4 cases were an aneurysm of subclavian artery [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR7"">7</xref>]. From a cohort of 187 patients with MFS, aortic branch aneurysms were identified in 50 (27%) patients. A total of 104 aneurysms were identified, and 62% of patients with aneurysms had more than one identified [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR8"">8</xref>]. Peripheral aneurysms can develop in iliac, femoral, and internal carotid arteries while subclavian and axillary arteries aneurysms are rarely reported [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR9"">9</xref>, <xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR10"">10</xref>]. This case showed a successful vascular repair of symptomatic significant multiple true aneurysms in unusual locations of MFS patient that manifested as a huge pulsatile mass. A 54-year-old woman with documented history of MFS presented to our center complaining of pulsating mass in right axillary area and inner part of the right arm for the past 6 months. She reported pain in this area which was started 7 days prior to her visit. This patient has a past medical history of Bentall surgery with a mechanical valve for severe aortic regurgitation and an ascending aortic aneurysm in 2009 and thoracoabdominal aortic repair following a thoracic aortic dissection in 2015. Her Bentall procedure was conducted utilizing femoral artery cannulation method. On examination she had classical external feature of MFS, including being tall and thin with long upper and lower limbs. Her cardiovascular examination showed normal first heart sound and metallic click. The examination of right axillary area and arm revealed a pulsating mass of significant size. Blood pressure of left upper limb was 110/60 mmHg while right radial pulse was palpably weaker compared to the left side. A localized ultrasound examination revealed an aneurysmal formation in the territory of the distal part of right subclavian artery with maximum diameter of 3.2 cm (Fig. <xref rid=""Fig1"" ref-type=""fig"">1</xref>). A saccular shape dilatation in the axillary artery with maximum diameter of 5.5 cm was found in both longitudinal and cross section suggestive of right axillary artery aneurysm (Fig. <xref rid=""Fig1"" ref-type=""fig"">1</xref>). Contrast-enhanced computed tomography revealed a tortuous part in proximal segment of right subclavian artery as well as an aneurysm in the distal segment of the subclavian artery extending to the axillary artery which showed complete aneurysmal formation. No stenosis or dilation was detected in the brachial artery (Fig. <xref rid=""Fig2"" ref-type=""fig"">2</xref>).

 After 2 days of admission, 9 days after the onset of pain, the patient’s INR levels reached the suitable range for surgical intervention. The corrective surgery was then performed to avoid a devastating complication such as rupture aneurysm of the patient. A multidisciplinary team, including endovascular surgeons and interventional specialists, evaluated her condition to choose the optimal treatment approach. Due to the excessive aneurysmal dilation and tortuosity observed in the CT angiography images, the team decided to decline endovascular approach and to proceed with surgical approach. Therefore, open surgery was conducted as the most appropriate intervention. Under general anesthesia the patient placed in a supine position, with the shoulder slightly elevated and the arm in a horizontal position, forming a 90° angle with the body. To expose and identify the affected arteries, Infraclavicular and deltopectoral incisions were used for aneurysmal resection. The skin incision was extended from the middle of the clavicle to the anterior axillary line in the direction of the apex. The pectoralis muscle was divided along its fibers, and the pectoralis minor muscle was transected. The aneurysm was located anteriorly to brachial plexus. There was no adhesion to the plexus observed. Subclavian artery aneurysm found and the segments proximal and distal to the aneurysm were explored first. The aneurysm was resected subsequent to clamping of the proximal and distal arterial segments after the intravenous injection of 5,000 IU of heparin. After aneurysmectomy (Fig. <xref rid=""Fig3"" ref-type=""fig"">3</xref>), a polytetrafluoroethylene (ePTFE) graft (JOTEC GmbH- Germany, Diameter 7 mm Length = 12 cm) was interposed. The specimens from the aneurysmal wall were sent for histopathologic examination.

 Following the procedure all the distal pulses were present with good volume in the patient’s right arm. The postoperative period was smooth without significant events and there was no evidence of neuropraxia. The patient discharged in good condition. At the follow-up appointment 2 weeks after discharge in outpatient clinic, the patient was in a good health with no symptoms. Aneurysm and dissection of aorta is a common complication seen in patient with MFS, however, the formation of peripheral aneurysms, particularly within the subclavian and axillary arteries have been rarely reported. Peripheral aneurysms are either asymptomatic or manifest with symptoms like pain, swelling or pulsation. Nevertheless, these aneurysms can lead to serious complication including rupture, thrombosis or embolism with subsequent increasing morbidity and mortality [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR9"">9</xref>]. Taking in consideration the possible serious complications of subclavian and axillary arteries aneurysms, regardless of the size all symptomatic aneurysms should be treated [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR9"">9</xref>]. As reoperation incidence for aneurysm and dissection is significant, Long-term follow-up of patients with MFS is crucial. Regular screening utilizing Computed Tomography (CT) scan or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in the first 6 months after treatment is recommended. The interval could be lengthened to once a year if no complications were detected [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR9"">9</xref>, <xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR11"">11</xref>]. Treatment options for subclavian and axillary aneurysms encompass open surgical repair, endovascular stenting, or a combination of both, depending on the size, location, and overall patient’s health status. Surgical strategies for treating subclavian and axillary arteries aneurysms include resection with end-to-end anastomosis. Endovascular intervention is not encouraged in patients with MFS due to vessel wall weakness and poor stent stability. Open surgery has been chosen as the most frequent choice for aneurysms found in all locations of the extremities among patients with MFS [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR12"">12</xref>]. In this case, the patient was admitted due to multiple aneurysms in the subclavian and axillary arteries. Due to the excessive tortuosity of artery and aneurysmal dilation, the medical team supposed that the endovascular approach was not appropriate, and open surgery was chosen to avoid further complications [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR13"">13</xref>]. Therefore, after aneurysmectomy, a ePTFE vascular graft was interposed. There are limited studies on treating subclavian and axillary arteries aneurysms, however, our approach in this case corroborates with previous case reports, as Dolapoglu et al. reported a patient with multiple subclavian and axillary aneurysms who was successfully treated with surgical repair using a Dacron graft. In another study, Morisaki et al. described a patient with an aneurysm in subclavian artery which was fully resected and replaced with a synthetic graft. Nawa et al. presented a case with a true aneurysm of axillary-subclavian artery with cystic medio-necrosis that was treated with interposition of a prosthetic vascular graft and reconstructed axillary-subclavian artery [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR14"">14</xref>, <xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR15"">15</xref>]. Our study provides an additional support to the importance of close monitoring and regular screening of peripheral arteries which can be helpful in patients with MFS. Peripheral aneurysms are one of the remarkable complications in patients with MFS. Early diagnosis and prompt surgical intervention are crucial to improve the outcome and prevent further complications. In this case, the patient had successful corrective surgery without any complications. Clinicians are recommended to be aware of the possibility of peripheral aneurysms in patients with MFS and consider appropriate screening and management strategies.",N/A,1 11 2024
Growth Rate Assessed by Vascular Deformation Mapping predicts Type B Aortic Dissection in Marfan Syndrome,,"Marfan syndrome (MFS) is an inherited connective tissue disorder that affects approximately 1 in 4,000 people, attributable to to gene variants within fibrillin-1. While cardiovascular manifestations drive morbidity and mortality in MFS, disease severity can vary widely between individuals.<sup><xref rid=""R1"" ref-type=""bibr"">1</xref>, <xref rid=""R2"" ref-type=""bibr"">2</xref></sup> Advances in prophylactic aortic root/ascending repair, along with increased rates of diagnosis, has led to an increased life expectancy by over 25 years.<sup><xref rid=""R3"" ref-type=""bibr"">3</xref></sup> However, MFS patients continue to face new challenges due to longer life expectancies and extended natural disease progression, such as the risk of type B dissection (TBAD) and the development of secondary complications.<sup><xref rid=""R3"" ref-type=""bibr"">3</xref>–<xref rid=""R7"" ref-type=""bibr"">7</xref></sup> This has resulted in a higher prevalence of chronic dissection of the distal aorta, necessitating more operations and increased morbidity and mortality.<sup><xref rid=""R3"" ref-type=""bibr"">3</xref>–<xref rid=""R5"" ref-type=""bibr"">5</xref>, <xref rid=""R8"" ref-type=""bibr"">8</xref>–<xref rid=""R10"" ref-type=""bibr"">10</xref></sup> Progressive dilation of the distal aorta elevates the risk of TBAD, even when the degree of dilation is mild.<sup><xref rid=""R6"" ref-type=""bibr"">6</xref>, <xref rid=""R7"" ref-type=""bibr"">7</xref>, <xref rid=""R11"" ref-type=""bibr"">11</xref></sup> The underlying mechanisms contributing to this heightened risk of TBAD remain uncertain, with abnormal blood flow, stiffness mismatch between graft and native tissue in patients with prior root/ascending replacement, and arch geometry all playing a potential role. Current risk assessment and management strategies in MFS rely heavily on 1-dimensional diameter measurements. However, these measurements are performed in a limited number of anatomic locations and are prone to significant variability,<sup><xref rid=""R12"" ref-type=""bibr"">12</xref>, <xref rid=""R13"" ref-type=""bibr"">13</xref></sup> making the confident determination of magnitude and extent of growth during surveillance very challenging. Imaging biomarkers such as the aortic tortuosity index, vertebral artery tortuosity, and the presence of primary non-aortic lesions have been explored for their potential to predict aortic growth rate and aortic events.<sup><xref rid=""R14"" ref-type=""bibr"">14</xref>–<xref rid=""R19"" ref-type=""bibr"">19</xref></sup> Furthermore, studies have examined geometric features and conducted three-dimensional (3D) statistical analyses of thoracic aortic aneurysm shapes and geometry,<sup><xref rid=""R14"" ref-type=""bibr"">14</xref>, <xref rid=""R15"" ref-type=""bibr"">15</xref>, <xref rid=""R20"" ref-type=""bibr"">20</xref></sup> in an attempt to establish clear links to disease etiology, severity, and clinical outcomes. However, owing to significant heterogeneity in aortic disease severity in MFS and the fact that these metrics have largely not been shown to predict key complications such as dissection, their impact on disease management remains a topic of investigation.<sup><xref rid=""R21"" ref-type=""bibr"">21</xref>, <xref rid=""R22"" ref-type=""bibr"">22</xref></sup> Vascular deformation mapping (VDM) is an emerging medical image analysis technique for accurate, 3D mapping of aortic growth between clinical electrocardiogram-gated CT angiography (CTA) scans. The accuracy and reproducibility of VDM technique has been validated using both clinical data and synthetic phantoms and has been shown to outperform expert raters in the identification of the location and magnitude of aortic growth.<sup><xref rid=""R23"" ref-type=""bibr"">23</xref></sup> Owing to its volumetric nature, VDM has the ability to clearly depict distinct patterns of thoracic aortic growth, including growth outside of the maximally dilated segment, among diverse cohorts of patients with hereditable thoracic aortic diseases and sporadic thoracic aortic aneurysms.<sup><xref rid=""R24"" ref-type=""bibr"">24</xref>, <xref rid=""R25"" ref-type=""bibr"">25</xref></sup> Understanding aortic growth rate in patients with MFS may better help define disease severity and predict complications such as TBAD.<sup><xref rid=""R7"" ref-type=""bibr"">7</xref></sup> In this study, we employed VDM to examine growth of the descending thoracic among a large cohort of MFS with high-quality, longitudinal CTA imaging. We specifically aimed to investigate patient characteristics, anatomic features and 3D aortic growth metrics that are associated with development of TBAD in MFS.   The results of this study revealed several unique and clinically relevant insights regarding imaging biomarkers that may confer risk of TBAD among patients with Marfan syndrome. First, our findings confirm prior reports showing the TBAD in MFS tends to occur in non-dilated or minimally dilated segments, at sizes far below typical surgical repair thresholds. Second, we demonstrate that both radial growth rate, derived from VDM, and elongation rate of the descending thoracic aorta, derived from centerline measurement, are independent predictors of TBAD development. Third, TBAD patients demonstrated higher pre-dissection diameters in their distal thoracic and abdominal aortic segments suggesting a more diffuse and severe aortic disease phenotype. Although underpowered for multivariable analysis, we identified high rates of dural ectasia, warfarin use, and mechanical aortic valve replacement in our TBAD group, suggesting that these factors may be associated with risk of dissection, either directly or via associations with a more severe disease phenotype. Fourth, we identified younger age, baseline maximal diameter of the descending thoracoabdominal aorta, smoking history, and use of warfarin to be independent predictors of aortic growth rate in MFS. Lastly, patients with atherosclerotic calcification of the thoracoabdominal aorta displayed a higher risk for TBAD after age adjustment, as well as a higher rate of descending aortic elongation, although not radial growth rate. In this cohort of patients with MFS, radial growth and elongation rates of the descending thoracic aorta were independent predictors of TBAD occurrence during imaging surveillance. TBAD often occurred in non-dilated or slightly dilated descending thoracic aorta and was not predicted by pre-dissection aortic diameter or age at ARR. These findings provide important insights and mark an important step forward in predicting and managing aortic complications in MFS.",N/A,13 10 2024
Mid- to long-term radiological and respiratory outcomes following surgery for older early-onset scoliosis patients with Marfan syndrome,"This study aimed to elucidate mid- to long-term radiological and respiratory outcomes in patients aged 7–11 years at index surgery with Marfan syndrome and early-onset scoliosis (EOS) in a retrospective multicenter study. Primary outcomes were final thoracic height and final percentage of predicted vital capacity (%VC) at or after 16 years of age. We identified 21 (6 male and 15 female) patients with a mean age of 9.9 years and mean follow-up period of 149.3 months. Fifteen patients underwent primary fusion, whereas six underwent growth-friendly surgery (GFS). The mean preoperative and final T1–T12 heights were 204.0 mm and 248.0 mm, respectively. Final pulmonary function tests were available for 16 patients, and the mean final %VC was 54.0% with 10 patients exhibiting a final %VC < 60%. A significant moderate association was observed between the final T1–T12 height and final %VC. The predicted final T1–T12 height required for a final %VC of 60% was approximately 260 mm. Although most older patients with Marfan syndrome and EOS acquired a considerably large final T1–T12 height, a larger thoracic height was required for satisfactory respiratory function in many cases; hence, GFS may be indicated even in this population.","The Marfan syndrome (OMIM: #154,700), initially described by Antoine-Bernard Marfan in 1896, is an autosomal dominant heritable disorder of the connective tissue characterized by several clinical manifestations, including dilatation of the aortic root, ectopia lentis, and distinctive skeletal features<sup><xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR1"">1</xref>,<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR2"">2</xref></sup>. Among the various musculoskeletal manifestations in patients with Marfan syndrome, spinal deformities cause pain and restrictive ventilatory impairment and can be the main issue affecting patients’ daily activities. Because patients with Marfan syndrome are potentially at high risk of further impairment of cardiopulmonary function following thoracotomy and/or recurrent pneumothorax, preventing the progression of spinal deformity and further deterioration of respiratory function is crucial. Additionally, the life expectancy in these patients has improved over the last few decades owing to better medical and surgical management of cardiovascular conditions; thus, appropriate control of spinal deformities is increasingly important<sup><xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR3"">3</xref></sup>. Spinal deformity in Marfan syndrome often presents as early-onset scoliosis (EOS); however, the management of patients with Marfan syndrome and EOS is challenging. Conservative treatments, including casting or bracing, are rarely effective in halting curve progression in EOS coexisting with Marfan syndrome<sup><xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR4"">4</xref>–<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR6"">6</xref></sup>. Conversely, surgery for EOS in Marfan syndrome is reportedly accompanied by a high incidence of complications<sup><xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR5"">5</xref>,<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR7"">7</xref>,<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR8"">8</xref></sup>. Historically, patients with Marfan syndrome who required early cardiac surgery were at a greater risk of early death, and spinal surgery was avoided until later childhood; however, recently, surgery has been aggressively indicated for those with Marfan syndrome and EOS because of the improved management of coexisting aortic dilatation and valvular lesions<sup><xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR5"">5</xref>,<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR7"">7</xref>,<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR8"">8</xref></sup>. For patients with EOS, growth-friendly surgery (GFS), including growing rods, vertical expandable prosthetic titanium ribs, or the Shilla procedure, can be indicated to acquire sufficient thoracic height at skeletal maturity, because the final thoracic height correlates with the final forced vital capacity (FVC)<sup><xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR9"">9</xref>,<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR10"">10</xref></sup>. GFS is especially favored in younger patients with EOS, even at the cost of a high incidence of complications because early definitive fusion in these patients leads to restrictive pulmonary diseases<sup><xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR11"">11</xref></sup>. However, some controversies have emerged in recent years regarding the treatment strategy for older patients with EOS, considering the high incidence of complications in GFS and potential loss of thoracic-height growth in primary definitive fusion (PF)<sup><xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR12"">12</xref>–<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR14"">14</xref></sup>. Consequently, the optimal treatment for older patients with Marfan syndrome and EOS remains unknown. Hence, to gain insight into the optimal treatment for this population, this study aimed to elucidate the middle- to long-term radiological and respiratory outcomes in patients with Marfan syndrome and EOS of 7–11 years of age at the time of index surgery who underwent GFS or PF at multiple centers.  This study yielded three novel findings. First, it demonstrated that most older patients with Marfan syndrome and EOS had considerably large final T1–T12 heights. Second, the final respiratory function was unsatisfactory in most of the older patients with Marfan syndrome and EOS. Third, the predicted final T1–T12 height required for a final %VC of 60% was approximately 260 mm. Since Karol et al. demonstrated the correlation between respiratory function and final thoracic height, the goal for the management of patients with EOS has been to gain as much thoracic height as possible<sup><xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR9"">9</xref></sup>. In their report, they proposed a thoracic height of 18 cm as the minimum threshold, which corresponded to a percentage of predicted FVC (%FVC) of approximately 50–60%<sup><xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR9"">9</xref></sup>. Recently, many surgeons have adopted 22 cm as a thoracic-height goal because patients who achieved 22 cm of thoracic height presented near-normal pulmonary function in their reports<sup><xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR9"">9</xref>,<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR15"">15</xref></sup>. Conversely, because these previous studies did not consider the impact of different etiologies or the magnitude of residual deformities, recent studies have raised doubts about such threshold<sup><xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR10"">10</xref></sup>. Especially in Marfan syndrome, other factors, including a history of pneumothorax or thoracotomy, pectus deformity, and sarcopenia, supposedly impact respiratory function; therefore, applying these thresholds as goals for patients with Marfan syndrome and EOS may be premature. However, no report has elucidated a goal for the management of EOS in Marfan syndrome in terms of respiratory function, which motivated us to conduct this study. In the present study, most patients acquired a considerably large final T1–T12 height with an average of 248.0 mm, which far exceeded the previously reported threshold of 22 cm and was consistent with the findings of a previous study that reported a final mean T1–T12 height of 238 mm in 42 patients with Marfan syndrome and EOS<sup><xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR7"">7</xref></sup>. However, the final respiratory function was not satisfactory in many cases in the present study with an average of 54.0% of final %VC in 16 patients. Although a significant correlation between the final thoracic height and final %VC was observed in the present study, as reported in previous studies, the predicted thoracic height required for a final %VC of 60% was calculated to be approximately 260 mm, which was much larger than 22 cm. Considering that the final thoracic height in the PF group was 247.7 mm in the present study, GFS might be indicated even in older patients with Marfan syndrome and EOS. Additionally, surgeons may be motivated to perform GFS in these patients because the typical law of diminishing returns, by which progressive stiffness of the spine leads to a reduced ability to distract over time, was not observed during GFS in this population in a previous study, albeit the high incidence of complications<sup><xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR7"">7</xref></sup>. Considering that the final T1–T12 heights were less than 200 mm in patients undergoing PF at or under 8 years of age, PF apparently should be avoided, at least in those aged 8 years or younger, although it is unavoidable due to comorbidities in some cases. The reason for poor final respiratory function in many patients in the current study is unknown. Few reports have demonstrated respiratory function in patients with Marfan syndrome. Kolonics-Faredrkas et al. reported that the mean %FVC in 32 patients with Marfan syndrome was 87.0%, which was slightly below the reference values<sup><xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR16"">16</xref></sup>. Additionally, Cipriano et al. demonstrated that the mean %FVC in 46 patients with Marfan syndrome was 88.3%<sup><xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR17"">17</xref></sup>. These previous reports indicated that Marfan syndrome alone did not largely impact respiratory function. Residual spinal and/or pectus deformities might have affected respiratory function in the present study population. Furthermore, patients with Marfan syndrome presenting with EOS may exhibit more severe muscle weakness than those without EOS, which could lead to a worse expiratory volume. However, the effect of each phenotype on respiratory function requires further investigation. This study has a few limitations. First, the data were collected retrospectively and not prospectively; therefore, information bias might have occurred. Second, only 21 participants were included in the present study; thus, the sample size might have been insufficient to determine the optimal treatment for this population. Third, the final PFT results were not available in five patients, which might cause selection bias; however, the impact of these five patients might be small because the mean preoperative %VC in all 21 patients and that in 16 with final PFT results available were comparable (65.1% vs. 67.4%). Fourth, the choice of surgical procedure, either GFS or PF, was left to the discretion of each surgeon, which might have introduced indication bias. Fifth, the impact of each phenotype on respiratory function, including a history of pneumothorax, sarcopenia, pectus deformity, or cardiac function, was not considered. Sixth, the genotype–phenotype correlation was not considered in the present study because of the limited number of eligible cases. Because several studies to date have demonstrated genotype–phenotype correlations in Marfan syndrome, the phenotype of respiratory muscles may also differ among cases with different <italic toggle=""yes"">FBN1</italic> variants<sup><xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR18"">18</xref>–<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR21"">21</xref></sup>. In conclusion, we investigated the mid- to long-term surgical outcomes in older patients with Marfan syndrome and EOS. Although most patients had acquired a considerably large final T1–T12 height with an average of 248.0 mm, the final respiratory function was not satisfactory in many cases. Because the predicted final T1–T12 height required for a final %VC of 60% was approximately 260 mm, GFS may be indicated even in older patients with Marfan syndrome and EOS, albeit with a high incidence of complications.

Coronary Artery Aneurysm Thrombosis in a Patient With Marfan Syndrome,"Coronary artery aneurysm in adults is associated with connective tissue disorders, including Marfan syndrome. Coronary artery aneurysms are at risk for thrombosis, which obstructs coronary flow and thus results in myocardial infarction. We present a case of coronary artery aneurysm thrombosis in a patient with Marfan syndrome who presented with acute coronary syndrome. ","A 56-year-old man with Marfan syndrome (MFS) presented to the hospital with chest pain for 3 hours that started after he exerted himself during an employment physical fitness assessment. His chest pain was substernal and radiated to his left arm, with a severity score of 8/10; it worsened with exertion and improved with rest.<boxed-text id=""dtbox1""><sec id=""dtbox1sec1""><title>Take-Home Messages</title><p id=""p0015""><list list-type=""simple"" id=""ulist0010""><list-item id=""u0010""><label>•</label><p id=""p0020"">ACS in patients with vasculitides and connective tissue disorders may represent thrombosis of a CAA.</p></list-item><list-item id=""u0015""><label>•</label><p id=""p0025"">Identification of a CAA thrombosis should prompt a comprehensive evaluation of the role of antiplatelet therapy, anticoagulation therapy, and revascularization.</p></list-item></list></p></sec></boxed-text> On evaluation, his vital signs were within normal limits. The cardiac physical examination was significant for a regular heart rate and rhythm with normal S<sub>1</sub> and S<sub>2</sub> sounds; there were no added heart sounds or murmurs. Jugular venous distention and lower limb swelling were not present. Our patient initially received a diagnosis of MFS 15 years before presentation, at which time he underwent an evaluation after his brother received a diagnosis of aortic dissection and was subsequently found to have MFS. Genetic testing revealed a fibrillin-1 mutation in our patient. Cardiac testing showed severe dilation of the ascending aortic root that was managed by valve-sparing surgical aortic root replacement; findings on serial imaging with yearly echocardiography and cardiac magnetic resonance at years 5 and 10 post-procedure were unremarkable. Our patient’s presentation was most consistent with acute coronary syndrome (ACS). Causes include coronary artery occlusion, vasospasm, dissection, and aneurysm thrombosis. Other potential causes of his presentation included aortic dissection, acute aortic syndrome, pericarditis, myopericarditis, and pulmonary embolism. The electrocardiogram showed a normal sinus rhythm with T-wave inversions in leads II, II, and aVF without ST-segment changes. His high-sensitivity troponin I value was 15,537 ng/L on presentation and peaked at 16,211 ng/L (reference range, <19 ng/L) within 3 hours. His B-type natriuretic peptide value was 177 pg/mL (reference range, <50 pg/mL). Basic metabolic profile, hepatic function panel, coagulation profile, and complete blood count findings were unremarkable. A transthoracic echocardiogram revealed normal biventricular size and systolic function without regional wall motion abnormalities. Valvular evaluation was notable for mild aortic and mitral regurgitation without significant stenosis. Our patient was medically managed for ACS; he received therapeutic anticoagulation with a heparin infusion, antiplatelet therapy with aspirin, a beta-blocker, and a statin. He underwent urgent invasive coronary angiography, which showed severe aneurysmal disease involving all coronary arteries with diffusely slow coronary flow. The distal right coronary artery (RCA) was poorly visualized, with contrast material pooling in the aneurysmal middle RCA, suggestive of aneurysm thrombosis causing coronary occlusion (<xref rid=""fig1"" ref-type=""fig"">Figures 1</xref> and <xref rid=""fig2"" ref-type=""fig"">2</xref>, <xref rid=""mmc1"" ref-type=""supplementary-material"">Videos 1</xref> and <xref rid=""mmc2"" ref-type=""supplementary-material"">2</xref>).

He had not previously undergone dedicated advanced imaging of the coronary arteries or functional testing for myocardial ischemia. Our patient’s angina resolved after medical management; therefore, his presentation did not warrant percutaneous or surgical revascularization. Occlusion of the RCA was deemed the likely culprit for his clinical presentation, for which he was prescribed lifelong therapeutic anticoagulation with a vitamin K antagonist to reduce the risk of coronary artery aneurysm (CAA) thrombosis. He was referred to outpatient cardiologists and cardiac surgeons specialized in MFS and associated diseases of the aorta. Our patient received maintenance anticoagulation therapy with a vitamin K antagonist without further episodes of angina. Three months after his presentation, he was found to have aortic valve infective endocarditis resulting in severe insufficiency with valve destruction. He was managed with antibiotics and underwent surgical replacement of the aortic valve with a mechanical valve. Given his known myocardial infarction in the setting of ischemia at the PLB, he underwent concurrent coronary artery bypass grafting with a saphenous vein graft to the posterior descending artery. Our patient’s clinical presentation was consistent with ACS secondary to CAA thrombosis. His history of MFS likely predisposed him to the development of extensive CAAs, which are prone to complications, including thrombosis, embolization, rupture, and vasospasm. CAA is defined as coronary artery dilation with a diameter that is 50% greater than that of normal adjacent segments.

Patients with CAA who are managed with medical therapy or revascularization require close follow-up and a multidisciplinary heart team approach to their care. These patients could benefit from surveillance imaging with advanced imaging modalities and functional testing for inducible myocardial ischemia; the interval of follow-up should be tailored to each patient’s individual risk of complications. In the absence of defined imaging protocols and clinical practice guidelines, further research is necessary to clarify the role of screening and surveillance for CAA in at-risk patients. CAA is a lesser-known complication of MFS. It confers high morbidity and mortality because of the risk of aneurysm thrombosis. Dedicated imaging to screen for and monitor CAAs in these patients could be useful to prevent complications.

Tracheal Stenosis Associated With Operation for Pneumothorax With Marfan Syndrome: A Case Report,"Marfan syndrome is a genetic disorder in which impaired protein leads to connective tissue weakness. We herein report a case of unexpected tracheal stenosis that was diagnosed just before an operation for a recurrent right pneumothorax with Marfan syndrome. A 16-year-old boy with bilateral repeated pneumothoraces associated with Marfan syndrome came to our emergency room complaining of dyspnea. A chest radiograph showed recurrent right pneumothorax. An operation was planned due to prolonged air leakage even after chest tube drainage. On induction of general anesthesia for repairing pneumothorax, a sudden difficulty occurred during manual ventilation, and the blood oxygen saturation temporarily decreased to 50%. Therefore, emergent intubation with a single-lumen tube was applied, which led back to full saturation. Bronchoscopy revealed a tortuous and flattened trachea. An endobronchial blocker tube was applied due to difficulty in double-lumen tube insertion, and bullectomy was accomplished without any other unexpected events. Patients with Marfan syndrome may have asymptomatic tracheal stenosis due to structural abnormalities and latent tracheomalacia, and general anesthesia could be a trigger to develop the symptoms. Surgeons should bear this in mind, cooperate with anesthesiologists well, and prepare for emergent intubation when managing patients with Marfan syndrome in the perioperative settings.","Impairment of glycoprotein fibrillin 1 (encoded by gene mutations with an autosomal dominant pattern of inheritance) is known to weaken connective tissue, which in turn triggers various clinical symptoms in Marfan syndrome. There is a sporadic type of this condition, and approximately one in four patients with Marfan syndrome have a de novo mutation [<xref rid=""REF1"" ref-type=""bibr"">1</xref>]. Weak connective tissue forms weak cartilage of the trachea, which could lead to tracheomalacia [<xref rid=""REF2"" ref-type=""bibr"">2</xref>]. The development of tracheomalacia during an operation due to direct structural pressure toward the trachea has been reported [<xref rid=""REF3"" ref-type=""bibr"">3</xref>]. We herein report a case in which a patient with Marfan syndrome unexpectedly developed symptomatic tracheal stenosis probably due to structural abnormalities and latent tracheomalacia immediately after the induction of general anesthesia. The patient was a 16-year-old boy with dyspnea and right chest pain who had been diagnosed with Marfan syndrome based on a genetic test. There was no relevant family history. The patient had undergone bilateral repeated pneumothorax surgeries. A chest radiograph in the emergency room showed recurrent right pneumothorax (Figure <xref rid=""FIG1"" ref-type=""fig"">1</xref>). A trocar catheter was inserted, and he was admitted for observation. Then, the third operation for the right pneumothorax was performed due to prolonged air leakage. After the venous injection of sedative and muscle relaxant, the anesthesiologist experienced sudden difficulty with bag valve mask ventilation, and the blood oxygen saturation dropped to 50%. Emergent intubation with a single-lumen tube was applied, and the saturation returned to 100%. The preoperative computed tomography (CT) showed a slight narrowing of the trachea anteroposteriorly but no complete obstruction (Figure <xref rid=""FIG2"" ref-type=""fig"">2</xref>). The bronchoscopy after the induction of general anesthesia revealed a tortuous and flattened trachea and crescent-type tracheomalacia (Figure <xref rid=""FIG3"" ref-type=""fig"">3</xref>). Several unsuccessful attempts were made to switch to a double-lumen tube. Therefore, a blocker with a single-lumen tube was used for differential lung ventilation. Intraoperatively, a 2-cm apical bulla was observed. A sealing test to check whether there was air leakage from the bulla with a positive pressure of 25 cm H2O was negative. The adhesion around the bulla was dissected, and bullectomy was performed with a surgical stapler (Figure <xref rid=""FIG4"" ref-type=""fig"">4</xref>). Curved spine due to scoliosis, superior vena cava, and trachea were observed after the bulla was resected (Figure <xref rid=""FIG5"" ref-type=""fig"">5</xref>). It seemed that there was a direct pressure from the spine toward the trachea to some extent. Extubation was carried out without any respiratory trouble after the anesthesia was discontinued although we were concerned about the risk of suffocation. The postoperative course was uneventful except for transient right lower lobe atelectasis. A chest radiograph at two months postoperatively showed complete expansion of the right lung (Figure <xref rid=""FIG6"" ref-type=""fig"">6</xref>). In pathological findings of the resected bulla, the decreased number of elastic fibers was seen with the Elastica van Gieson stain (Figure <xref rid=""FIG7"" ref-type=""fig"">7</xref>). Through this case with an important forewarning, we should know that dynamic tracheal stenosis can suddenly become symptomatic, provoked by general anesthesia [<xref rid=""REF4"" ref-type=""bibr"">4</xref>]. Intrathoracic pressure is usually lower than airway pressure, but with bag valve mask ventilation, the intrathoracic and alveolar pressures markedly increase. Airway pressure decreases toward the thoracic outlet. When the supportability of the trachea is reduced due to its weak connective tissue, the trachea is easily constricted by external pressure, and tracheal stenosis is likely to occur especially during expiration [<xref rid=""REF3"" ref-type=""bibr"">3</xref>,<xref rid=""REF5"" ref-type=""bibr"">5</xref>]. The bronchoscopy revealed crescent-type tracheomalacia with anteroposterior obstruction, which is thought to be caused by weakening of the anterior cartilaginous wall [<xref rid=""REF3"" ref-type=""bibr"">3</xref>,<xref rid=""REF6"" ref-type=""bibr"">6</xref>]. Besides, patients with Marfan syndrome have been reported to have a decreased number of elastic fibers in resected bullae (Figure <xref rid=""FIG7"" ref-type=""fig"">7</xref>), which are degenerated and fragmented [<xref rid=""REF7"" ref-type=""bibr"">7</xref>]. With this genetic condition, there might be a reduction of elastic fibers in the membranous part of the trachea as well, which together with the weak anterior cartilage led to this latent tracheomalacia, hence tracheal stenosis. Preoperative bronchoscopy may be considered for understanding the winding airway; however, the procedure without general anesthesia might not lead to the same findings as seen in this case. Structural abnormalities may sometimes cause difficulty in ventilation. The preoperative CT showed no cardiovascular anomalies or mediastinal lesions compressing the trachea. However, there was a sign of mild compression of the trachea by the spine and the sternum both on the CT (Figure <xref rid=""FIG2"" ref-type=""fig"">2</xref>) and the intraoperative image (Figure <xref rid=""FIG5"" ref-type=""fig"">5</xref>). Hence, pectus excavatum and scoliosis may also have been responsible for the symptom in the present case. It is learned from this case that the risk of similar suffocation does exist with a narrowed airway on a preoperative CT and therefore you should be ready to deal with it even if a patient is asymptomatic before operation. When ventilation with a bag valve mask cannot be done, it can be usually resolved by emergent intubation and advancing the tube just above the carina. This case highlights the critical importance of recognizing the potential for tracheal stenosis to become symptomatic suddenly, particularly under general anesthesia. Structural abnormalities of Marfan syndrome, such as pectus excavatum and scoliosis, and possible tracheomalacia might contribute to tracheal stenosis. Preoperative bronchoscopy might be useful for understanding the airway's condition, though findings without general anesthesia might differ. The case underscores the importance of being prepared for airway management challenges, even in asymptomatic patients, as emergent intubation may be necessary when bag valve mask ventilation fails. If similar problems occur, we should intubate the patient without hesitation.",N/A,22 8 2024
Hybrid approach to achieve secure distal seal zones during endovascular aortic repair in a patient with Marfan syndrome,"This report details a hybrid approach for treatment of abdominal aortic aneurysm in a patient with Marfan syndrome (MFS). A 34-year-old patient with MFS and prior open thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysm repair underwent bilateral common iliac artery interposition graft repair and endovascular aortic repair. The bifurcated stent graft was implanted into the previous thoracoabdominal graft proximally and iliac interposition grafts distally. Postoperatively, the patient recovered uneventfully with sac regression to 4.5 cm through 2-year follow-up, without seal zone degeneration. This hybrid approach aimed to eliminate landing zone degeneration in patients with MFS undergoing endovascular repair.","A 34-year-old man with MFS and a history of multiple open aortic replacements presented to our clinic for an enlarging infrarenal AAA. Twelve years earlier, the patient underwent elective valve-sparing aortic root replacement. Four years later, he developed a type B<sub>2-11</sub> dissection extending into the left common iliac artery, complicated by right lower extremity acute limb ischemia, requiring fasciotomies, skin grafts, and left to right femoral-femoral bypass. Three years thereafter, surveillance imaging revealed increased aneurysmal dilatation of a Crawford extent I post-dissection thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysm (TAAA) to 5.8 cm with occlusion of the previous femoral-femoral bypass (<xref rid=""fig1"" ref-type=""fig"">Fig 1</xref>). The patient underwent a successful open TAAA repair with a multibranch graft to the celiac, superior mesenteric, and bilateral renal arteries. Aortic replacement was confined to the juxtarenal aorta to decrease risk of spinal cord ischemia.<fig id=""fig1""><label>Fig 1</label><caption><p>Patient's thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysm (TAAA) seen on follow-up imaging after valve-sparing root repair in coronal view <bold>(A)</bold> and sagittal view <bold>(B)</bold>.

Genetic counseling was offered, but the patient deferred, having already received genetic confirmation of his MFS diagnosis. Given the previous operation involving the juxtarenal aorta, we elected a hybrid repair with open bilateral iliac artery interposition grafting, followed by concomitant EVAR landing proximally into the previous thoracoabdominal graft and iliac grafts distally. Under general anesthesia, we performed a midline laparotomy from the umbilicus to the pubis, reflecting the mesentery to expose the left iliac bifurcation. The distal left common iliac artery was divided, and its distal end was oversewn. A 10-mm Dacron graft was anastomosed to the proximal stump in end-to-end fashion. The distal end of the bypass was anastomosed to the external iliac artery in end-to-side fashion, preserving flow to the internal iliac artery. A temporary iliac conduit was sewn onto this bypass graft in end-to-side fashion (<xref rid=""fig2"" ref-type=""fig"">Fig 2</xref>). The right iliac artery was replaced in similar fashion. Each conduit was accessed and upsized to 18F and a 12F sheath, through which a 35 × 14 × 14 cm Gore Excluder (W. L. Gore & Associates, Flagstaff, AZ) was positioned. The Excluder was deployed into the prior open TAAA Dacron and sealed distally into the iliac grafts. This technique ensured both proximal and distal landing zones for the EVAR were within prosthetic material, eliminating potential native tissue dilation. The patient recovered uneventfully and was discharged on postoperative day 4.

However, in staged open aortic repairs, transitional aortic segments can be challenging, because the distal end of the previous aortic repair needs to be dissected and controlled for proximal control during subsequent open repair. In the aortic arch and descending thoracic aorta, this challenge can be addressed by applying a hybrid frozen elephant trunk (FET) technique. This technique involves deploying a stent graft into the replaced aortic arch, which then serves as the site for proximal anastomosis during subsequent thoracoabdominal aortic reconstructions distally. In this case, our configuration applied the FET principle by landing the stent graft within prosthetic material both proximally and distally, effectively eliminating interaction between the stent grafts and native vessels along the EVAR seal zones. Additionally, this application circumvented the need for surgical dissection in redo fields for the proximal anastomosis, which would have been difficult in a patient with multiple aortic reoperations. Previous studies report reintervention rates after EVAR in patients with MFS ranging from 11% to 55%.<xref rid=""bib3"" ref-type=""bibr""><sup>3</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid=""bib17"" ref-type=""bibr""><sup>17</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid=""bib21"" ref-type=""bibr""><sup>21</sup></xref> Patients with MFS have higher rates of reintervention owing to continued degeneration of the aorta at landing zones and friable aortic tissue vulnerable to stent graft-induced new entry tears.<xref rid=""bib19"" ref-type=""bibr""><sup>19</sup></xref> The incidence of these complications and patients at risk for reintervention after endovascular repair are not well-established.

Continued surveillance is planned to assess long-term durability. This case emphasizes the need for patient-specific strategies in managing MFS-related aortic complications. Moreover, comparative data with traditional open and total endovascular repair are needed to draw conclusions on optimal technique for treating patients with MFS. In this case, the patient's previous open thoracoabdominal replacement left adequate space below the renal branch graft, enabling a secure proximal seal zone for EVAR. This allowed us to avoid surgical dissection around the juxtarenal aorta. The principles of the FET hybrid approach through EVAR with concurrent bilateral common iliac artery interposition grafts can be used in patients with MFS with continued AAA degeneration. This technique with limited open replacement of EVAR seal zones may be a viable option in patients with genetic aortopathies and complex prior open aortic repairs. S.M.H. is a consultant for W.

","Marfan syndrome (MFS) is a complex genetic systemic connective tissue disorder, first described in 1896. The estimated prevalence is 1 in 3000–5000 in Europe (Howarth et al. <xref rid=""mgg370004-bib-0014"" ref-type=""bibr"">2007</xref>; Moberg et al. <xref rid=""mgg370004-bib-0023"" ref-type=""bibr"">2012</xref>) whereas 1–2/10,000 in China (Dong et al. <xref rid=""mgg370004-bib-0008"" ref-type=""bibr"">2012</xref>), with no apparent sex or ethnicity biases. It is characterized by a wide range of clinical manifestations involving the skeletal, ocular, and cardiovascular systems, demonstrating striking pleiotropic effects and variable clinical symptoms. The diagnosis relies on defined clinical criteria (Ghent nosology), outlined by international experts to facilitate accurate recognition of this genetic aneurysm syndrome and to improve patient management and counseling (Loeys et al. <xref rid=""mgg370004-bib-0022"" ref-type=""bibr"">2010</xref>). However, the survival of MFS patients has been substantially improved through prophylactic aortic surgery combined with comprehensive medical treatment (Franken et al. <xref rid=""mgg370004-bib-0012"" ref-type=""bibr"">2015</xref>). Fibrillin, encoded by the <italic toggle=""yes"">FBN1</italic> gene, is a major constitutive element of extracellular microfibrils and is widely distributed in both elastic and nonelastic connective tissue throughout the body, thereby providing stability and elasticity. The <italic toggle=""yes"">FBN1</italic> gene, located in 15q21.1 and comprising 65 exons, is the causative gene of a series of autosomal dominant connective tissue disorders. Moreover, pathogenic variations in <italic toggle=""yes"">FBN1</italic> account for the majority of MFS cases. It is evident that 1/4 to 1/3 of MFS cases are sporadic (Fleck et al. <xref rid=""mgg370004-bib-0011"" ref-type=""bibr"">2004</xref>), yet relevant clinical data provide evidence that MFS follows an autosomal dominant inheritance pattern (Du et al. <xref rid=""mgg370004-bib-0009"" ref-type=""bibr"">2021</xref>). A Chinese family with MFS was investigated spanning two generations in this study. A novel SNV of <italic toggle=""yes"">FBN1</italic> at the noncanonical splice site c.443‐3C>G was found in the affected individuals. Further functional analysis classified the pathogenicity, pathogenesis, and classification of this variant, expanding the variant spectrum and providing a solid foundation for preimplantation genetic testing for monogenic disorders (PGT‐M).   It is well known that Marfan syndrome (MFS) was first reported in 1896, and the fibrillin‐1 (<italic toggle=""yes"">FBN1</italic>) gene was first isolated from cDNA clones in 1991 (Dietz et al. <xref rid=""mgg370004-bib-0007"" ref-type=""bibr"">1991</xref>). According to recent studies, genetic factors play a critical role in the progression of MFS (Verstraeten et al. <xref rid=""mgg370004-bib-0028"" ref-type=""bibr"">2016</xref>). About 75% of the affected individuals with the classic phenotype have variants over generations, while the remaining 25% have de novo variants (Franken et al. <xref rid=""mgg370004-bib-0012"" ref-type=""bibr"">2015</xref>). Up to now, more than 3000 variants of <italic toggle=""yes"">FBN1</italic> in individuals with MFS have been reported, and the proportion of point variants and large rearrangements are 73.09% and 1.66%, respectively (Becerra‐Munoz et al. <xref rid=""mgg370004-bib-0003"" ref-type=""bibr"">2018</xref>; Yang et al. <xref rid=""mgg370004-bib-0029"" ref-type=""bibr"">2018</xref>). Variants are distributed throughout the entire gene and there is no obvious aggregation or periodicity. Even though it is widely believed that MFS follows an autosomal dominant pattern, it is uncommon that MFS influenced with biallelic variations in FBN1 is associated with severe clinical manifestations (Li et al. <xref rid=""mgg370004-bib-0018"" ref-type=""bibr"">2019</xref>). In this case, only a non‐class splice site <italic toggle=""yes"">FBN1</italic>: c.443‐3C>G was detected, while minigene analysis was used to investigate the mechanism of variation‐induced alternative splicing. The results showed that it forms two abnormal mRNA transcripts, one including a frameshift and the other an in‐frame insertion. Previous studies have identified cryptic splicing in Marfan syndrome, involving a 111‐bp insertion and a 48‐bp deletion (Karttunen et al. <xref rid=""mgg370004-bib-0016"" ref-type=""bibr"">1998</xref>), both of which caused premature stop codons in <italic toggle=""yes"">FBN1</italic>, resulting in shorter <italic toggle=""yes"">FBN1</italic> polypeptides. Another case described a 33‐bp insertion encoding 11 amino acids in fibrillin‐1, including two cysteines (Hutchinson et al. <xref rid=""mgg370004-bib-0015"" ref-type=""bibr"">2001</xref>). Splice site variants in MFS have typically been associated with deletions or exon skipping (Li et al. <xref rid=""mgg370004-bib-0019"" ref-type=""bibr"">2020</xref>; Liu et al. <xref rid=""mgg370004-bib-0020"" ref-type=""bibr"">1997</xref>). The majority of exon‐skipping cases are in‐frame, resulting in incomplete proteins lacking integral domain. In a small percentage of cases, exon skipping causes frameshift and downstream premature termination codons (PTCs), which can initiate nonsense‐mediated mRNA decay (NMD). In this case, one of the aberrant mRNA transcripts includes the insertion of two nucleotides (AG) at the end of the 3′ splice site, which may be relevant to the HI (Haploinsufficiency) mechanism. The other transcript involves an in‐frame insertion resulting from a splice site variant. A previous study demonstrated that an intronic variant abolished the canonical splicing site, leading to the activation of two cryptic splicing sites, resulting in an insertion (Anna and Monika <xref rid=""mgg370004-bib-0001"" ref-type=""bibr"">2018</xref>). In contrast, both transcripts in this study formed PTCs and activated the NMD mechanism. The above findings can be considered evidence for PS3, a criteria for classifying pathogenic variants according to the ACMG guideline (2015): well established in vitro or in vivo functional studies supportive of a damaging effect on the gene or gene product. It is noted that functional studies validated, reproducible, and robust in a clinical diagnostic laboratory setting are considered the most well established. Therefore, combined with two additional lines of evidence: PM2_strong (absent from controls or presence at extremely low frequency in the Exome Sequencing Project, 1000 Genomes Project, or Exome Aggregation Consortium) and PP4 (the patient's phenotype or family history is highly specific for a disease with a single genetic etiology), this variant should be classified as “Likely pathogenic.” By far, over 3000 variants of <italic toggle=""yes"">FBN1</italic> in MFS patients have been reported, with point variants and large rearrangements comprising 73.09% and 1.66% of cases, respectively (Becerra‐Munoz et al. <xref rid=""mgg370004-bib-0003"" ref-type=""bibr"">2018</xref>; Yang et al. <xref rid=""mgg370004-bib-0029"" ref-type=""bibr"">2018</xref>). These variants are distributed throughout the entire gene, with no apparent aggregation or periodicity. While MFS is widely recognized as following an autosomal dominant pattern, rare cases of MFS with compound heterozygous variants in <italic toggle=""yes"">FBN1</italic> have been reported, and biallelic variants in <italic toggle=""yes"">FBN1</italic> are associated with severe clinical manifestations (Li et al. <xref rid=""mgg370004-bib-0018"" ref-type=""bibr"">2019</xref>). In a typical autosomal dominant disease such as Marfan syndrome (MFS), the pathogenic mechanisms primarily involve dominant‐negative (DN) effect and haploinsufficiency (HI), depending largely on the variant types (Franken et al. <xref rid=""mgg370004-bib-0012"" ref-type=""bibr"">2015</xref>). Previous research has established criteria for classifying different variant types. Variants leading to exon skipping or deletions resulting in in‐frame events and consequently producing shorter, stable proteins are classified as DN cases (Liu et al. <xref rid=""mgg370004-bib-0021"" ref-type=""bibr"">2001</xref>). In contrast, deletions of the entire <italic toggle=""yes"">FBN1</italic> gene or exon events that impact transcription and/or translation, along with variants leading to very short truncated proteins, are classified into the HI group (Franken et al. <xref rid=""mgg370004-bib-0012"" ref-type=""bibr"">2015</xref>). Missense variants that result in stable mutant fibrillin protein with altered structure or degradation are classified based on their effects on protein stability and structure (Schrijver et al. <xref rid=""mgg370004-bib-0026"" ref-type=""bibr"">1999</xref>). PTCs or frameshifts are categorized based on their potential to trigger nonsense‐mediated decay (NMD) (Schrijver et al. <xref rid=""mgg370004-bib-0027"" ref-type=""bibr"">2002</xref>). Although this theoretical classification appears reasonable, experimental evidence has demonstrated that predicting the ultimate effect of an <italic toggle=""yes"">FBN1</italic> variant on the protein is not straightforward. Therefore, without experimental protein studies, the predicted effects of a particular variant remain speculative. There has been long‐standing debate about whether <italic toggle=""yes"">FBN1</italic> variants cause Marfan syndrome through HI, DN mechanisms, or both (Dietz <xref rid=""mgg370004-bib-0006"" ref-type=""bibr"">2015</xref>). DN variants of <italic toggle=""yes"">FBN1</italic> affect the stability of microfibers under various conditions, rather than microfibril assembly, leading to different pathological manifestations (Charbonneau et al. <xref rid=""mgg370004-bib-0004"" ref-type=""bibr"">2010</xref>). As a result, HI mutations are theoretically expected to produce a consistent phenotype (Landis et al. <xref rid=""mgg370004-bib-0017"" ref-type=""bibr"">2017</xref>). Without considering the variant classification, there is a well‐established correlation between genotype and phenotype, depending on the variant's position within specific codons and domains. The most commonly accepted variants are located in exons 24–32, which are associated with early‐onset, neonatal issues, and more severe phenotypes (Faivre et al. <xref rid=""mgg370004-bib-0010"" ref-type=""bibr"">2007</xref>; Peng et al. <xref rid=""mgg370004-bib-0024"" ref-type=""bibr"">2016</xref>; Schrijver et al. <xref rid=""mgg370004-bib-0027"" ref-type=""bibr"">2002</xref>). Patients with variants in exons 43–65 exhibit an increased frequency of major cardiovascular events (Arbustini et al. <xref rid=""mgg370004-bib-0002"" ref-type=""bibr"">2005</xref>; Chung et al. <xref rid=""mgg370004-bib-0005"" ref-type=""bibr"">2009</xref>; Gao et al. <xref rid=""mgg370004-bib-0013"" ref-type=""bibr"">2019</xref>). Additionally, variants that alter the structure of <italic toggle=""yes"">FBN1</italic> are associated with symptoms in various affected organs or tissues (Faivre et al. <xref rid=""mgg370004-bib-0010"" ref-type=""bibr"">2007</xref>; Reinhardt et al. <xref rid=""mgg370004-bib-0025"" ref-type=""bibr"">2000</xref>). In our case, both pathogenic mechanisms might be simultaneously activated, suggesting the patient should exhibit more severe symptoms. However, the observed clinical manifestations were inconsistent with this prediction, indicating that a new hypothesis may be needed to explain this phenomenon. One limitation of this study is that the construct utilized incorporated only a portion of intron 5, the complete sequence of exon 6, and a section of intron 6. Consequently, defects in the splicing process affecting the exon 5/exon 6 and exon 6/exon 7 junctions would remain undetected. This limitation is significant because it means that one of the most common consequences of variations in the <italic toggle=""yes"">FBN1</italic> gene, specifically the skipping of exon 6 during splicing, would not be detected with this particular construct. Therefore, while the construct's design is useful for studying other aspects of <italic toggle=""yes"">FBN1</italic> gene expression and splicing, it is not suitable for identifying splicing defects at the exon 5/6 and 6/7 junctions. When studying splicing defects in probands with genetic disorders, considering their unique genetic backgrounds is crucial. In the case of the <italic toggle=""yes"">FBN1</italic> gene associated with Marfan syndrome and other related connective tissue disorders, mutations affecting splicing can have significant clinical implications. For example, as previously noted, the most common result of <italic toggle=""yes"">FBN1</italic> splice mutations is a skip in exon 6. However, other splicing alterations are possible, and the proband's genetic background can influence the risk and nature of these defects. Various factors, such as genetic variation, epigenetic markings, and expression levels of splicing factors, add complexity to the situation. However, genetic analysis and identification of the upper lineage were not carried out, representing another limitation of this study, as the influence of genetic background on the splicing defect could not be fully understood. This study utilized non‐human primate cells, providing insights into splicing mechanisms and gene function; however, extrapolating these findings to humans is limited by genetic differences and variations in cell environments. Although validation using human cells or tissues would be ideal, it was not feasible in this study. This research identified a novel intronic pathogenic <italic toggle=""yes"">FBN1</italic> variant (c.443‐3C>G) in a family with MFS, leading to two distinct aberrant splicing effects. These findings thus expanded the variant spectrum and provided a strong indication and sufficient basis for PGT‐M.

" Genetic analysis of a novel <italic toggle=""yes"">FBN1</italic> mutation in a pediatric Marfan syndrome patient ","The aim of this study was to investigate a novel <italic toggle=""yes"">FBN1</italic> gene mutation in a pediatric patient with Marfan syndrome (MFS) to provide a theoretical basis for genetic counseling. The subject was a 5-month-old male infant. With informed consent from the proband and his family, 2 mL of peripheral venous blood was collected from the patient, his father, mother, and sister. DNA was extracted using a DNA extraction kit with EDTA-K as an anticoagulant. The extracted DNA was subjected to minigene transcription and bioinformatics analysis. For minigene construction, wild-type and mutant minigenes were inserted into pcMINI and pcMINI-C vectors, respectively. Four recombinant vectors were transfected into the HeLa and 293T cell lines. After transfection for 48 hours, RNA was extracted from eight samples. DNA was also extracted from the family members' samples to construct a library. Target regions were captured using the SureSelect Human All Exon V6 (Agilent) kit and were sequenced with Illumina NovaSeq (sequencing read length 2×150 bp). Bioinformatic analysis identified the c.8226+5del mutation as a variant of uncertain clinical significance (VOUS). Literature and database reviews confirmed that this mutation had not been previously reported, identifying it as a novel mutation. The study identified a novel <italic toggle=""yes"">FBN1</italic> mutation, c.8226+5del, that may be associated with clinical features such as low-set ears and distinctive facial characteristics in the proband.

Complement C3a/C3aR inhibition alleviates the formation of aortic aneurysm in Marfan syndrome mice,"Mutations in fibrillin 1 (<italic toggle=""yes"">FBN1</italic>) is the main cause of Marfan syndrome (MFS) with thoracic aortic aneurysm (TAA) as the main complication. Activation of the complement system plays a key role in the formation of thoracic and abdominal aortic aneurysms. However, the role of the complement system in MFS-associated aortic aneurysms remains unclear. In this study, we observed increased levels of complement C3a and C5a in the plasma of MFS patients and mouse, and the increased deposition of the activated complement system product C3b/iC3b was also observed in the elastic fiber rupture zone of 3-month-old MFS mice. The expression of C3a receptor (C3aR) was increased in MFS aortas, and recombinant C3a promoted the expression of cytokines in macrophages. The administration of a C3aR antagonist (C3aRA) attenuated the development of thoracic aortic aneurysms in MFS mice. The increased inflammation response and matrix metalloproteinases activities were also attenuated by C3aRA treatment in MFS mice. Therefore, these findings indicate that the complement C3a/C3aR inhibition alleviates the formation of aortic aneurysm in Marfan syndrome mice.","Marfan syndrome (MFS) is an autosomal dominant genetic disease, mainly caused by mutations in the fibrillin-1 (<italic toggle=""yes"">FBN1</italic>) gene. MFS affects the cardiovascular system, eye, skeleton, skeletal muscles, lungs, and skin. At the later stage, the most life-threatening complications include thoracic aortic aneurysm (TAA) and dissection [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR1"">1</xref>, <xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR2"">2</xref>]. To date, there are no effective drugs for the clinical management of TAA. Once an aneurysm is detected, it is usually monitored until surgical aortic replacement is necessary. To develop effective molecular targeted therapies for MFS-associated aortic aneurysm, detailed studies on the molecular mechanisms underlying aneurysm development are needed. The Fbn1<sup>C1041G/+</sup> transgenic mouse model harbors the most common mutation in <italic toggle=""yes"">FBN1</italic> observed in MFS patients. This causes a heterozygous cysteine substitution in the epidermal growth factor-like domain in FBN1. These mutations result in normal mRNA expression but decreased FBN1 deposition in the extracellular matrix (ECM) [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR3"">3</xref>]. The major function of fibrillin-1 is as a structural component of elastic fibers. Another function of FBN1 is to anchor transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) and maintain it in an inactive state. Increased activity of the TGF-β signaling pathway is implicated in aortic dilation and aneurysm formation at an early stage [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR4"">4</xref>, <xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR5"">5</xref>]. However, other pathological markers such as enhanced proteolytic activity, increased levels of inflammatory cytokines and chemokines, infiltration of inflammatory cells in the aortic wall, vascular smooth muscle cell apoptosis, and medial degeneration are also associated with the Marfan aorta [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR6"">6</xref>]. Aortic inflammation contributes to the development of aortic aneurysms, and anti-inflammatory drugs and antioxidants slow the progression of aortic aneurysms in Marfan mice [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR5"">5</xref>–<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR7"">7</xref>]. Initiation of AngII signalings may be responsible for ECM degenenration and inflammation in MFS aortic aneurysm [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR8"">8</xref>]. Losartan, an angiotensin 1 receptor (AT1R) blocker, could reduce free TGF-β levels, it also increases nitric oxide production independent to AT1R pathway. Several clinical researches have confirmed the therapeutic effect of Losartan in patients with MFS [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR9"">9</xref>, <xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR10"">10</xref>]. However, the mechanism underlying the inflammatory response in the aorta at an early stage remains unclear. The complement system mainly plays a critical role in recognizing microorganisms and triggering phagocytosis and immunity, especially in the initiation and regulation of immune cell responses [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR11"">11</xref>]. The complement system plays a key role in the inflammatory response in various cardiovascular diseases and is associated with thoracic and abdominal aortic aneurysm development [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR12"">12</xref>, <xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR13"">13</xref>]. Activation of the complement system promotes aggregation of inflammatory cells at the site of vascular lesions [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR14"">14</xref>], and promotes aortic aneurysm formation in an elastase perfusion-induced mouse aortic aneurysm model [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR15"">15</xref>]. Genetic deficiency of the complement C3a receptor (C3aR) or early application of SB290157, a C3aR antagonist, reduces the incidence of aortic aneurysm/dissection in a BAPN-induced TAA model [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR16"">16</xref>]. However, the role of the complement system in the formation of MFS-associated aortic aneurysm remains unclear. In this study, we used FBN1<sup>C1041G/+</sup> transgenic mice as the animal model of MFS. The activation of the complement system in the serum and aortic tissue was detected. Treatment with the C3aR antagonist, SB290157, was used to explore the role of complement activation in the formation of MFS-associated aortic aneurysm.   In this study, we found that the complement system was overactivated in MFS patients with thoracic aortic aneurysm and MFS mice. Treatment with a C3aRA attenuates inflammation response and MMPs activities, which contribute to alleviate the aortic dilatation and elastic fiber rupture in MFS mice (Fig. <xref rid=""Fig7"" ref-type=""fig"">7</xref>). 
<fig id=""Fig7""><label>Fig. 7</label><caption><p>Schematic illustration of the C3a-C3aR pathway contributing to the formation of aortic aneurysm in MFS mice</p></caption><graphic http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink href=""12872_2024_4077_Fig7_HTML"" id=""d33e925""></graphic></fig>
 FBN1 mutations are the main cause of MFS. FBN1 is a cellular structural protein, and its main role is to anchor TGF-β1, inhibit its activation, and activate the downstream SMAD signaling pathway. FBN1 gene mutations lead to increased TGF-β1-related signaling, which contributes to aortic aneurysm development [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR3"">3</xref>]. However, early administration of TGF-β1 neutralizing antibody in FBN1 transgenic mice aggravates aortic dilatation [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR4"">4</xref>]. Therefore, excessive activation of TGF-β1 signaling is not the only mechanism underlying MFS-associated aortic aneurysm formation. New intervention targets for delaying the progression of MFS-associated aortic aneurysms have been identified. The expression of nitric oxide synthase 2 is increased in the aortic tissue of MFS patients and mouse models of MFS. Inhibition of nitric oxide synthase 2 can significantly alleviate aortic dilatation and elastic fiber rupture in Marfan mice [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR5"">5</xref>]. The mitochondrial function of VSMCs is regulated by the extracellular matrix and it drives the development of aortic aneurysms in MFS. Restoring mitochondrial metabolism with the NAD precursor nicotinamide riboside rapidly reverses aortic aneurysms in Marfan mice [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR22"">22</xref>]. In our previous study, we identified a new subpopulation of fibroblasts with greater SPP1 expression in the aortas of Marfan mice using bulk RNA-seq and scRNA-seq. The cytokine SPP1 could function as an accelerator of TAA progression and could provide a new target for the treatment of TAA [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR17"">17</xref>]. In this study, we identified a new intervention target, the C3a-C3aR pathway. The complement system participates in the activation of innate and adaptive immunity and plays a key role in the occurrence and development of various immune-related diseases [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR23"">23</xref>, <xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR24"">24</xref>]. Complement system components are involved in the formation of aortic aneurysms and aortic dissections. The complement molecules, C3, C4, factor B, properdin, and the membrane attack complex C5b-9 are expressed in human aortic aneurysm tissues [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR25"">25</xref>, <xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR26"">26</xref>]. In this study, we found that the plasma levels of complement activation products C3a and C5a were increased in MFS patients and mice, especially C3a were increased earlier than aortic dilation in MFS mice. Moreover, C3b/iC3b was deposited at the rupture site of the elastic fibers in the aortic wall of MFS mice. A recent study also reported increased complement factors and C3 activation in both human and murine MFS aortas [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR27"">27</xref>]. Our data suggested that the complement system was activated at the early stage of the aortic aneurysm formation in MFS mice. Complement system could be activated by three pathways: the classical pathway, the lectin pathway and the alternative pathway. A recent study using the C1-esterase inhibitor (C1-INH), which could inhibit the classical and lectin activation pathway of the complement system, could decreased C3 and reduced macrophages, yet there was no reduction in aortic diameters in MFS mice [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR27"">27</xref>]. It maybe due to that the complement system could also been activated through alternative pathway. This result was also consistent with the elastase-perfused abdominal aortic aneurysm mouse model, the deletion of the C4 gene, a key molecule in the classical complement pathway activation, does not affect the diameter of aortic aneurysms [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR15"">15</xref>]. The deletion of factor B, one of the key molecules in the alternative complement pathway activation, inhibits elastase-perfused induced aortic dilatation by reducing the infiltration of neutrophils [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR24"">24</xref>]. Increased elastic fibers breaks, cell damage and the activity of caspase have been reported in the aortic tissue of MFS mice [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR28"">28</xref>]. Meanwhile, researches have shown that HSP and HMGB1 released from damaged cells or IgG recognized neo-antigen expressed on damaged aortic tissues could induce complement activation through the alternative pathway [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR25"">25</xref>–<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR30"">30</xref>]. So, the alternative pathway may contribute to the activation of complement system during the formation of MFS associated aortic aneurysm. The role of alternative pathway needs to be confirmed in future (Table <xref rid=""Tab1"" ref-type=""table"">1</xref>). Excessive activation of the complement system is associated with various chronic disorders [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR31"">31</xref>–<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR33"">33</xref>]. The activated products of the complement system play a key role in promoting aortic aneurysm formation. C3aR, the receptor of the complement activation product C3a, is expressed ubiquitously on a variety of cell surfaces. Deletion of C3aR reduces the expression of chemokines, reduces the recruitment of neutrophils to the injured site, and attenuates elastase function in perfusion-induced abdominal aortic aneurysm [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR15"">15</xref>]. C3aR gene deletion or early application of SB290157, a C3aR inhibitor, reduces the incidence of aortic aneurysm/dissection in a BAPN-induced TAA model [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR16"">16</xref>]. An analysis of the genetic data of patients with TAA from a public database, using weighted gene co-expression network analysis, shows that CX3CR1, C3, and C3AR1 are the top three hub genes in the module correlated with TAA [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR34"">34</xref>]. In this study, the expression of C3aR increased in the aortas of MFS mice. The C3a-C3aR pathway promotes macrophage recruitment by promoting chemokines release [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR35"">35</xref>]. In this study, we also found that rC3a increased the expression of IL-1β, CCL2,SPP1 in macrophages, the infiltration of macrophages and the expression of cytokines IL-1β, CCL2,SPP1 and MMP9 were decreased in C3aRA-treated MFS aorta. Macrophages secrete MMP9 to destroy the ECM, which promote aortic dilation during aortic aneurysm formation [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR36"">36</xref>, <xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR37"">37</xref>]. TAD is closely associated with increased activity of MMP9 in the aortas of mice; the knockout of MMP9 protects against the formation and rupture of TAD [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR38"">38</xref>]. Macrophage-derived SPP1, also known as osteopontin, promotes the formation of Ang II-induced abdominal aortic aneurysm. Genetic deficiency in SPP1 attenuates aortic aneurysm formation by decreasing MMP2 and MMP9 activity [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR39"">39</xref>]. SPP1 mediates the decline of the SMC contractile phenotype via Itga8/Itgb1 [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR17"">17</xref>]. Thus, the C3a-C3aR pathway could promote macrophage infiltration and further promote elastic fiber degradation and aortic dilation during aortic aneurysm formation. The current guideline recommended treatments in MFS aortopathy, including Angiotensin II receptor blocker and beta blockers, have reduced the rate of aortic root dilation in MFS patients and no previous aortic surgery [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR40"">40</xref>]. Our current results do not provide evidences to determine this new treatment is better or worse than those existing drugs in guidelines, however a better therapeutic effect may be achieved by adding a new intervention target. The difference between this new treatment and other tried drugs in mouse MFS model (resveratrol, losartan, allopurinol, nitro-oleic acid) are the different targets of drugs. Resveratrol reduces aortic aneurysm dilation rate by inhibiting aortic elastin breaks, the improvement of endothelial dysfunction and smooth muscle cell survival, reducing oxidative stress [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR41"">41</xref>, <xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR42"">42</xref>]. losartan attenuated the aortic aneurysm dilation by inhibiting the AT1R associated signaling pathway [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR10"">10</xref>]. Allopurinol, a xanthine oxidase inhibitor, also could inhibit the aneurysm formation of MFS [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR43"">43</xref>]. Nitro-oleic acid, a nitrated fatty acid that reduces nitric oxide synthase 2 expression, has a therapeutic effect in MFS Fbn1<sup>C1041G/+</sup> mice by inhibition of aortic ERK1/2, Smad2 as well as nuclear factor kappa B overactivation and consequent attenuation of elastin fragmentation [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR20"">20</xref>]. Our study may provide a new therapeutic target for MFS associated aortic aneurysms. As a limitation of the study, the complement levels in MFS patients with aortic aneurysm patients were observed, the change in complement system in MFS patients without aortic aneurysm patients could not be fully confirmed in the current study. It might need a specific clinical study design to enroll the MFS genotype-mutation confirmed patients with no aortic aneurysm phenotype. Another limitation of the study, the effect of C3aRA on male mice after treatment was observed, and the treatment period was only one-month, long-term effect of C3aRA on the MFS associated aortic aneurysms and side effects need to be observed in future study. In conclusion, this study shows that the complement system is overactivated in the early stages of MFS and inhibition of the C3a-C3aR pathway can delay the formation of aortic aneurysms.",N/A,10 8 2024
Management of a pregnant woman with Marfan syndrome and aortic root and aberrant right subclavian artery aneurysm: a case report,,"Marfan syndrome is an autosomal dominant connective tissue disorder that involves the vascular tree and can lead to aortic aneurysms with the risk of dissection and rupture.

She was also known to have an aberrant right subclavian artery. The implications of pregnancy with her condition were never discussed with her. The patient presented to the Department of Congenital and Paediatric Cardiology again when she was 21 weeks into her first pregnancy and referred for a foetal echocardiogram. At the time of presentation, she was clinically well and asymptomatic. She was treated with beta-blockers (metoprolol 47.5 mg twice a day), and this was continued throughout the pregnancy. Echocardiography showed an increased aortic root size compared to her last examination with a maximum diameter of 55 mm (Z-score +6.6, <italic toggle=""yes""><xref rid=""ytae411-F1"" ref-type=""fig"">Figure 1</xref></italic>, <italic toggle=""yes""><xref rid=""sup1"" ref-type=""supplementary-material"">Movie clips 1</xref></italic> and <italic toggle=""yes""><xref rid=""sup1"" ref-type=""supplementary-material"">2</xref></italic>).<sup><xref rid=""ytae411-B5"" ref-type=""bibr"">5</xref></sup> There was mild aortic valve and trivial mitral valve regurgitation.

The ascending aorta and the aortic arch were not dilated (ascending aorta at right pulmonary artery level 22 × 25 mm, upper ascending aorta 20 × 22 mm, transverse aortic arch 21 × 23 mm), but the proximal descending aorta was mildly enlarged (24 × 26 mm) (<italic toggle=""yes""><xref rid=""ytae411-F2"" ref-type=""fig"">Figures 2</xref></italic> and <italic toggle=""yes""><xref rid=""ytae411-F3"" ref-type=""fig"">3</xref></italic>, <italic toggle=""yes""><xref rid=""sup1"" ref-type=""supplementary-material"">Movie clips 3</xref></italic><xref rid=""sup1"" ref-type=""supplementary-material"">–</xref><italic toggle=""yes""><xref rid=""sup1"" ref-type=""supplementary-material"">6</xref></italic>).

A multidisciplinary case discussion involving cardiology, cardiovascular surgery, angiology, anaesthesiology, obstetrics, and neonatologists was held to discuss further management considering the risks for mother and foetus involved in the different treatment options (conservative vs. interventional vs. surgical management). The risk of ascending aortic dissection and rupture was thought to be significant and life-threatening for both the mother and foetus,<sup><xref rid=""ytae411-B1"" ref-type=""bibr"">1</xref>,<xref rid=""ytae411-B2"" ref-type=""bibr"">2</xref>,<xref rid=""ytae411-B7"" ref-type=""bibr"">7</xref></sup> and potentially higher than aortic surgery during pregnancy. Therefore, urgent aortic root replacement during pregnancy was discussed including peri- and intraoperative management for the mother and foetus and the patient consented to the procedure. It was also felt that the risk for surgical treatment of the aberrant subclavian artery aneurysm during the same procedure would prolong the procedure and increase its risk particularly for the foetus. It was felt that repeat CMR imaging was required during the remainder of the pregnancy to evaluate the potential need for an additional interventional (transcatheter) procedure during or after pregnancy. Successful valve-sparing aortic root and ascending aorta replacement was performed at 22 + 2 weeks of gestation. For foetal safety, cardiopulmonary bypass temperature was kept near normothermic (35°C) and perioperative foetal echocardiography was performed. Intraoperative inspection of the ascending aorta showed confined dissection of the vessel wall at the level of the pulmonary artery that was not seen on the CMR images. Histopathology of the resected aortic segment confirmed fresh dissection of the aortic wall. The foetus survived the operation, and post-operative course of the mother was timely. Repeated imaging during pregnancy, peri- and post-partum showed mild aortic regurgitation (regurgitant fraction 7%), and stable dimensions of the aorta (upper ascending aorta 21 × 23 mm, transverse aortic arch 21 × 23 mm, proximal descending aorta 25 × 26 mm) while there was a mild increase in size of the aneurysm of the aberrant right subclavian artery (<italic toggle=""yes""><xref rid=""ytae411-F4"" ref-type=""fig"">Figure 4</xref></italic>). At 35 weeks of gestation, the patient developed cervical insufficiency and an uncomplicated caesarean section was performed with delivery of a healthy boy. Post-partum recovery of the mother was unremarkable. The baby, however, was diagnosed with hypertrophic pyloric stenosis and underwent pyloromyotomy before mother and child were discharged in good condition ∼3 weeks after caesarean section. Paediatric cardiology investigations in the child did not show any cardiovascular abnormality. The subclavian aneurysm was treated successfully by interventional embolization after interdisciplinary team discussions. Follow-up investigations at 1 and 11 months show good surgical and interventional results, and the patient is in good clinical condition and treated with a beta-blocker to prevent further aortic dilatation. The main cardiovascular manifestation in patients with Marfan syndrome is dilatation of the aortic root than can lead to type A aortic dissection and aortic rupture with high mortality rates.<sup><xref rid=""ytae411-B8"" ref-type=""bibr"">8</xref>,<xref rid=""ytae411-B9"" ref-type=""bibr"">9</xref></sup> Dilatation of the descending aorta and type B aortic dissection are less common.<sup><xref rid=""ytae411-B8"" ref-type=""bibr"">8</xref>,<xref rid=""ytae411-B10"" ref-type=""bibr"">10</xref></sup> Pregnancy in women with Marfan syndrome increases the risk of aortic dissection with high mortality and morbidity for mother and child<sup><xref rid=""ytae411-B1"" ref-type=""bibr"">1</xref>,<xref rid=""ytae411-B2"" ref-type=""bibr"">2</xref>,<xref rid=""ytae411-B7"" ref-type=""bibr"">7</xref></sup> likely related to haemodynamic and hormonal changes.

Pregnancy in patients with Marfan syndrome carries an increased risk for cardiovascular complications, especially aortic dilatation, and dissection. Although aortic surgery was performed successfully during pregnancy in our case, cardiovascular bypass surgery is associated with high mortality. Regular aortic surveillance, pre-conception counselling, and timely aortic surgery prior to pregnancy are strongly advised to minimize the risk for mother and child.

Mitral valve transcatheter edge-to-edge repair as a bridge to treat aortic dissecting aneurysm in a case of Marfan syndrome: a case report,,"Marfan syndrome is a systemic connective tissue dysplasia of autosomal dominant inheritance associated with cardiovascular disease,<sup><xref rid=""ytae338-B1"" ref-type=""bibr"">1</xref></sup> including mitral regurgitation (MR), aortic root enlargement, aortic aneurysm, and aortic dissection. The aetiology of MR in patients with Marfan syndrome may be due to myxomatous degeneration of the valve leaflets; thus, valve fragility is a concern during surgical intervention. Although optimal surgical treatment of MR in Marfan syndrome (valve repair vs. replacement) has been controversial because the underlying connective tissue defect might compromise repair longevity,<sup><xref rid=""ytae338-B2"" ref-type=""bibr"">2</xref></sup> surgical mitral valve repair (SMVr) has been reported to have a better prognosis.<sup><xref rid=""ytae338-B3"" ref-type=""bibr"">3</xref></sup> However, mitral valve transcatheter edge-to-edge repair of mitral valve (MV-TEER) in patients with Marfan syndrome has been rarely reported.  A 57-year-old man diagnosed with known Marfan syndrome presented to a peripheral hospital with progressive dyspnoea and awareness of orthopnoea. His medical history included previous aortic dissection surgery (Bentall procedure with 25 mm CarboMedics Valsalva conduit and 28 mm LivaNova graft; total arch replacement with 26 mm four-branched J-graft, Japan Lifeline; and thoracic endovascular aortic repair with TAG 28 × 20 mm GORE) and post-operative residual thoracoabdominal dissecting aortic aneurysm (maximum diameter, 48 mm) 3 years ago. On admission, he exhibited systolic apical heart murmur and wheezing in the bilateral lung. Chest radiography showed cardiomegaly and pulmonary oedema. An electrocardiogram revealed sinus rhythm with left axis deviation, without ST changes, and a heart rate of 120 beats per minute. Laboratory test results showed: blood count, within normal range; high creatinine levels (1.3 mg/dL); mild liver dysfunction (aspartate aminotransferase, 42 U/L and alanine aminotransferase, 50 U/L); and elevated brain natriuretic peptide level (400 pg/mL). He was diagnosed with congestive heart failure (HF) and hospitalized. Diuretics and additional medications of inotropic agent compensated for HF. Post-thoracotomy yielded unclear results of transthoracic echocardiography (TTE); transoesophageal echocardiography (TEE) was performed and severe MR by anterior mitral leaflet 2 (AML2) prolapse with chordae rupture was recognized (<italic toggle=""yes""><xref rid=""ytae338-F1"" ref-type=""fig"">Figure 1</xref></italic> and <xref rid=""sup1"" ref-type=""supplementary-material"">Supplementary material online</xref>, <italic toggle=""yes""><xref rid=""sup1"" ref-type=""supplementary-material"">Video S1</xref></italic>). Mitral regurgitation flow into all four pulmonary veins occurred and the diastolic wave (D-wave) height was higher compared with systolic wave (S-wave) height (<italic toggle=""yes""><xref rid=""ytae338-F1"" ref-type=""fig"">Figure 1B</xref></italic>). The mitral valve pressure gradient was 2 mmHg and the mitral valve area was calculated (7.58 cm<sup>2</sup>) by three-dimensional planimetry. The lengths of AML2 and posterior mitral leaflet 2 (PML2) were 27 and 15 mm, respectively. Flail-gap between AML2 and PML2 was 9 mm. Initially, SMVr was planned. However, contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) showed prominent enlargement of the thoracoabdominal dissecting aortic aneurysm with a diameter of 71 mm without peripheral malperfusion and right common iliac artery aneurysm with a diameter of 41 mm (<italic toggle=""yes""><xref rid=""ytae338-F2"" ref-type=""fig"">Figure 2</xref></italic>). Simultaneous surgery for MR and dissection aortic aneurysm was ruled out because vascular access to the cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) machine was not possible due to the dissecting aortic aneurysm and severe HF. The patient was transferred to our hospital for treatment, showing a state of New York Heart Association (NYHA) class Ⅲ with low blood pressure (systolic blood pressure, 90 mmHg) without inotropic agents use. Coronary CT scan and dual single photon emission CT excluded coronary artery disease. Transthoracic echocardiography confirmed severe MR due to mitral valve AML2 prolapse (volumetric measurements showed regurgitant volume (RV) of 136 mL and regurgitant fraction (RF) of 66%, effective regurgitant orifice (ERO) 87 mm<sup>2</sup>, proximal iso velocity hemispheric surface area radius 13 mm, RV of 114 mL, RF of 55%, ERO 73 mm<sup>2</sup>). The mitral valve area was calculated (8.8 cm<sup>2</sup>) by two-dimensional planimetry. The artificial aortic valve was functioning; left ventricular ejection fraction was 66% without severe left ventricle dilatation. There was no myxomatous degeneration of the valve leaflets. The case was discussed with our heart team. The symptoms persisted despite the maximum HF treatment possible in this case, including oral administration of furosemide (20 mg), candesartan (2.0 mg), and spironolactone (25 mg). The surgical risk was intermediate to high (Euro score Ⅱ, 3.83% and STS score, 3.73% for SMVr without considering about coexistence of aortic aneurysm). Open-heart surgery was challenging due to the inability to use CPB devices, and the mitral valve morphology in this case was considered suitable for MV-TEER implementation,<sup><xref rid=""ytae338-B4"" ref-type=""bibr"">4</xref></sup> focusing solely on cardiac function and the degree of mitral valve regurgitation and excluding the fact that the patient had Marfan syndrome. We decided to proceed with MV-TEER initially and perform aortic aneurysm surgery in the chronic phase after improvement in HF. We had conveyed the conference content to the patient who understood and requested the treatment plan. We performed MV-TEER under general anaesthesia with intubation. The MV-TEER procedure was performed with single clip placement (MitraClip™ G4 XTW Abbott) grasping the centre of AML2 and PML2 (see <xref rid=""sup1"" ref-type=""supplementary-material"">Supplementary material online</xref>, <italic toggle=""yes""><xref rid=""sup1"" ref-type=""supplementary-material"">Video S2</xref></italic>). Intraprocedural TEE showed that MR severity was reduced to mild to moderate (<italic toggle=""yes""><xref rid=""ytae338-F3"" ref-type=""fig"">Figure 3</xref></italic> and <xref rid=""sup1"" ref-type=""supplementary-material"">Supplementary material online</xref>, <italic toggle=""yes""><xref rid=""sup1"" ref-type=""supplementary-material"">Video S3</xref></italic>), and mitral valve pressure gradient changed (2–3 mmHg). Although MR remained and the mitral valve leaflets were long and wide enough to allow a second clip placement, we terminated the procedure upon confirming disappearance of regurgitation into the pulmonary vein and alterations in pulmonary venous blood flow pattern (S-wave height > D-wave height) (<italic toggle=""yes""><xref rid=""ytae338-F3"" ref-type=""fig"">Figure 3B</xref></italic>). The left atrial pressure decreased from 34 to 15 mmHg in the systolic period. Heart failure symptoms improved after MV-TEER. One month after the MV-TEER, replacement surgery for the thoracoabdominal aorta was performed; the patient progressed well without complications. Post-operative medication comprised only warfarin (4 mg) and azilsartan (20 mg), without HF development. At one and a half years post-MV-TEER procedure, the patient has continued to attend outpatient appointments at our hospital. Although moderate residual MR was observed on TTE, there has been no HF recurrence; he maintained NYHA class Ⅰ status. If further MR progression or HF recurrence was observed, surgical intervention for MR would be considered. Both MR and aortic dissection or aneurysms are common complications in patients with Marfan syndrome. Complicated cardiovascular disease is critical in determining prognosis.<sup><xref rid=""ytae338-B5"" ref-type=""bibr"">5</xref>,<xref rid=""ytae338-B6"" ref-type=""bibr"">6</xref></sup> Several reports showed the effectiveness of MV-TEER in cases of degenerative MR wherein surgical operation carries a high risk.<sup><xref rid=""ytae338-B7"" ref-type=""bibr"">7</xref></sup> In cases of acute MR, particularly due to chordae rupture, HF progresses immediately and requires intervention. However, such cases represent with high surgical risk, wherein surgery is considered challenging. The effectiveness and safety of MV-TEER in cases of acute MR have been reported.<sup><xref rid=""ytae338-B8"" ref-type=""bibr"">8</xref></sup> However, the effectiveness and safety of MV-TEER in such cases of Marfan syndrome as the underlying condition are not clear. Additionally, we were concerned about the risk of mitral valve damage due to tissue fragility. Mitral valve transcatheter edge-to-edge repair in patients with Marfan syndrome with acute MR coexistence of enlarged dissecting aortic aneurysm is not reported. In cases such as this one with life-threatening comorbidities, MV-TEER can be a treatment option. In cases of Marfan syndrome, the coexistence rate of MR and aortic aneurysm is high,<sup><xref rid=""ytae338-B5"" ref-type=""bibr"">5</xref>,<xref rid=""ytae338-B6"" ref-type=""bibr"">6</xref></sup> and tissues are fragile. Therefore, we finished the procedure with a single clip placement. Although residual MR has been reported to be a harmful prognostic factor after MV-TEER,<sup><xref rid=""ytae338-B9"" ref-type=""bibr"">9</xref></sup> we allowed residual MR because reducing the risk of surgical intervention for aortic dissecting aneurysm was essential in this patient. If treatment of the aortic aneurysm was possible, we suggest that surgical intervention for the mitral valve would also be feasible in the event of worsening MR. Good clinical outcomes of MV-TEER as a bridge to heart transplantation have been reported.<sup><xref rid=""ytae338-B10"" ref-type=""bibr"">10</xref></sup> We consider that in this case, MV-TEER could also serve as a bridge if surgical intervention for the mitral valve is required in the future, after aortic surgery. Mitral valve transcatheter edge-to-edge repair may serve as a bridge to other invasive intervention. Mitral valve transcatheter edge-to-edge repair could effectively treat MR with HF in a patient with Marfan syndrome. Considering the risk of comorbidity, it could be a treatment option as a bridge therapy for treatment of further life-threatening conditions or for intervention for mitral valve disease exacerbated in the long-term period after MV-TEER.

The study included 33 eyes that underwent four different intraocular lens implantation (IOL) techniques: IOL in conjunction with a simple capsular tension ring, IOL in conjunction with a Cionni modified capsular tension ring (m-CTR), two-point scleral IOL fixation and IOL with one haptic in the bag and one haptic sutured to the sclera. <italic toggle=""yes"">Results</italic>: Vision significantly improved from a mean preoperative visual acuity of 0.1122 to a mean postoperative visual acuity of 0.4539 in both age groups (<italic toggle=""yes"">p</italic> < 0.0001), with no difference in the primary outcome between children and adults. The most common surgical technique used in both age groups was IOL in conjunction with an m-CTR. There was only one major postoperative complication requiring additional surgery. <italic toggle=""yes"">Conclusions</italic>: Zonular weakness mainly influenced by age was the most important selection criterion for the surgical approach. Regardless of the technique employed, the postoperative visual acuity was improved in both adults and children.","Marfan syndrome is an autosomal dominant inherited disorder that affects the connective tissue. It is caused by mutations in the fibrillin-1 gene (FBN1), which modifies fibrillin production [<xref rid=""B1-medicina-60-01098"" ref-type=""bibr"">1</xref>]. There have been identified over 3000 possible mutations of the FBN1 gene [<xref rid=""B2-medicina-60-01098"" ref-type=""bibr"">2</xref>]. Because fibrillin is the major component of the extracellular matrix [<xref rid=""B3-medicina-60-01098"" ref-type=""bibr"">3</xref>], its abnormal production affects numerous organs and systems; the most frequent being the cardiovascular, skeletal and ocular system. Marfan syndrome diagnosis is based on the revised Ghent nosology from 2010 [<xref rid=""B4-medicina-60-01098"" ref-type=""bibr"">4</xref>]. The only major diagnostic criterion for the ocular system is the presence of ectopia lentis [<xref rid=""B4-medicina-60-01098"" ref-type=""bibr"">4</xref>], which is the displacement of the crystalline lens from its anatomical position. In Marfan syndrome this is the most frequent manifestation involving the ocular system [<xref rid=""B5-medicina-60-01098"" ref-type=""bibr"">5</xref>]. In general, lens displacement affects both eyes with varying degrees of luxation [<xref rid=""B6-medicina-60-01098"" ref-type=""bibr"">6</xref>]. Patients with significant ectopia lentis complain of fluctuating or blurry vision or monocular diplopia. For these cases the only treatment is surgical removal of the natural crystalline lens, followed by an artificial intraocular lens (IOL) implant. The aim of this retrospective comparative study is to evaluate four surgical techniques used in ectopia lentis in children and adults with Marfan syndrome and postoperative results in terms of visual acuity and complications. This study was conducted in the Clinical Hospital for Ophthalmological Emergencies, Bucharest, Romania, according to the Declaration of Helsinki, being approved by the Ethics Committee of the hospital. The study was based on reviewing medical records and videos of ectopia lentis surgeries in patients (children and adults) with Marfan syndrome performed by the same surgeon between February 2012 and June 2020. Informed consent for patient information and images to be published was provided by the patients or their authorized representatives. Four methods of IOL implantation were performed and evaluated in this study: IOL implantation in the bag along with a simple capsular tension ring (CTR) (group 1), IOL implantation in the bag along with a scleral fixated Cionni CTR (group 2), scleral IOL fixation with suture in two points (group 3) and IOL implantation with one haptic in the bag and one haptic sutured to the sclera (group 4). The age, gender and full ophthalmic exams of patients included in the study were retrieved and analysed. The ophthalmic exams included: preoperative and postoperative best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) using a Snellen chart, slit lamp examination of anterior segment and eye fundus, intraocular pressure (IOP) measurements by a non-contact tonometer, Topcon CT-80 NCT (Topcon Medical Systems, Paramus, NJ, USA) in cooperative children and adults or under sevofluorane sedation with Tono-Pen XL (Reichert Inc., Depew, NY, USA) in incompliant children and B-scan ultrasonography in those cases where the fundus of the eye could not be examined due to a completely opaque crystalline lens. For cooperative patients, biometry was performed using an optical biometer (IOL Master500, Carl Zeiss Meditec, Jena, Germany), while for non-cooperative patients, contact ultrasound biometry was performed (Ultrascan Digital 2000 contact ultrasound A-scan, Alcon, Geneva, Switzerland), along with keratometric measurements taken with an autorefractokeratometer (Retinomax, Righton, Tokyo, Japan). The Sanders–Retzlaff-Kvaff/T (SRK/T) and Holliday–Segar formulas were applied to calculate the IOL power. We used optimized constants: for three-piece lenses, constant 118.4, and for single-piece lenses, constant 118.7. The postoperative refraction target was emmetropia or up to 1D hyperopia for children. Surgical treatment was pursued in severe lens subluxation when the lens equator was in the visual axis and also in patients with low visual acuity after best corrected visual acuity under 0.014 Snellen. Patients with crystalline lens removal followed by IOL implantation in the same surgery session were included in the study. Exclusion criteria: patients with advanced glaucoma, ocular inflammation, retinal diseases, keratoconus and pterygium. Postoperatively, the patients were examined after 1 day, 1 week, 1 month and 6 months. The BCVAs of the last follow-up were selected. Visual acuity was measured using the Snellen value, which was used to show the distribution of preoperative and postoperative BCVA. Complications were recorded after thorough ophthalmic examinations. The study lot consisted of 33 eyes (19 patients), including 16 female eyes (48.5%) and 17 male eyes (51.5%), with a mean age at the time of surgery of 17.39 ± 11.75 years, ranging from 4 to 42 years, and 48.5% of the patients being children (under 18 years of age) and 51.5% being adults (above 18 years of age). Of the 33 eyes, 16 were right eyes and 17 left eyes. Based on the surgical technique performed on each eye, the study lot was divided as follows: group 1—IOL implantation in the bag combined with a simple capsular tension ring—which was performed on 4 eyes, group 2—IOL implantation in the bag combined with a scleral fixated m-CTR—on 22 eyes, group 3—scleral IOL fixation with suture in 2 points—on 5 eyes and group 4—IOL implantation with one haptic in the bag and one haptic sutured to the sclera—on 2 eyes, with children/adults distribution for each group shown in <xref rid=""medicina-60-01098-t001"" ref-type=""table"">Table 1</xref>. Sample size will be estimated as follows: assuming the incidence of complications in patients with ectopia lentis is 15% and the margin of error is 20%. For a 5% significance level, Z<sub>α/2</sub> is 1.96 for the two-tailed alternative hypothesis with a sample size of 27. For each technique we assessed the following parameters (<xref rid=""medicina-60-01098-t002"" ref-type=""table"">Table 2</xref>): mean patients’ age, preoperative BCVA (preop BCVA), postoperative BCVA (postop BCVA), axial length and astigmatism. The data were analyzed by Mann–Whitney test regarding pre- and postoperative BCVA. Postoperative BCVA improved significantly in all 33 eyes (<italic toggle=""yes"">p</italic> < 0.05) but we obtained a high statistical significance in group 2 technique when compared with the preoperative BCVA (<italic toggle=""yes"">p</italic> < 0.05). Significant visual acuity improvement was observed in eyes with IOL implantation in the bag combined with a scleral-fixated Cionni m-CTR, but there was no statistical difference between techniques; all techniques improved BCVA (<xref rid=""medicina-60-01098-t002"" ref-type=""table"">Table 2</xref>). Two cases were lost within the 6-month follow-up period. Regarding BCVA distribution between these four techniques, the lowest BCVA of 0.1 was observed in a patient with scleral IOL fixation with sutures in two points. The highest BCVA was seen in a patient using the same surgical technique. In the study lot, 18 eyes had a BCVA between ≥0.3 and <0.8, which is considered a moderate visual acuity loss according to the International Council of Ophthalmology [<xref rid=""B7-medicina-60-01098"" ref-type=""bibr"">7</xref>], with the normal BCVA being ≥0.8. For statistical analysis, due to small groups, we compared technique 2 (IOL implantation in the bag combined with a scleral fixated Cionni CTR) with the other three techniques (group 1—IOL implantation in the bag combined with a simple capsular tension ring—which was performed, group 3—scleral IOL fixation with suture in 2 points and group 4—IOL implantation with one haptic in the bag and one haptic sutured to the sclera) to rule out differences in the visual acuity BCVA preoperative and postoperative (logMAR) (<xref rid=""medicina-60-01098-t003"" ref-type=""table"">Table 3</xref>). Mann–Whitney and Kruskal–Wallis tests was used between pre- and postoperative BCVA (logMAR) in each group and between technique 2 and the 3 others. No differences were observed in age, astigmatism or IOP between the main technique and the other grouped techniques, except for variations in the IOL type due to specific characteristics described in the <xref rid=""sec2-medicina-60-01098"" ref-type=""sec"">Section 2</xref>. The mean preoperative BCVA and postoperative BCVA was 0.1122 and 0.4539, respectively (SD ± 0.1114–0.248). The minimum preoperative BCVA was 0.014 and minimum postoperative BCVA was 0.1. The maximum preoperative BCVA was 0.5, while the maximum postoperative BCVA was 0.9 (<xref rid=""medicina-60-01098-f004"" ref-type=""fig"">Figure 4</xref>A). We also analyzed postoperative BCVA improvement, separately for children and adults. In children (<xref rid=""medicina-60-01098-f004"" ref-type=""fig"">Figure 4</xref>B), we obtained <italic toggle=""yes"">p</italic> < 0.0003, with a minimum preoperative BCVA of 0.014 and a minimum postoperative BCVA of 0.1. The maximum preoperative BCVA was 0.2 and postoperative BCVA was 0.9 (mean preoperative BCVA was 0.0765 and mean postoperative BCVA was 0.3247 with SD ± 0.05813–0.2173). In adults (<xref rid=""medicina-60-01098-f004"" ref-type=""fig"">Figure 4</xref>C), we obtained <italic toggle=""yes"">p</italic> < 0.0007 with a minimum preoperative BCVA of 0.014 and a minimum postoperative BCVA of 0.3. The maximum preoperative BCVA was 0.5 and the maximum postoperative BCVA 0.8 (mean preoperative BCVA was 0.1459 and mean postoperative BCVA was 0.5750 with SD ± 0.1384–0.1571). Postoperative BCVA for the entire study group showed a statistically significant improvement (<italic toggle=""yes"">p</italic> < 0.0001), despite two missing patients from the follow-up measurements. For 32 eyes (for one eye the AL and keratometric data were unavailable), we analyzed the value of the flattest meridian (K1), the value of the steepest meridian (K2), as well as the average of the two meridians (Kmed). We obtained a minimum K1 of 35.68 D, a maximum K1 of 45.24 D and an average of 40.72 ± 2.37 D. For K2, we obtained a minimum of 38.66 D, a maximum of 50.29 D and an average of 42.86 ± 2.77 D. The Kmed values had a minimum of 37.17 D, a maximum of 47.27 D and an average of 41.83 ± 2.46 D. The keratometric values were roughly homogeneous throughout the study lot; the mean values of these measurements are presented in <xref rid=""medicina-60-01098-t004"" ref-type=""table"">Table 4</xref>. The type of astigmatism was separately evaluated for children and adults, according to the location of the steepest meridian (<xref rid=""medicina-60-01098-t005"" ref-type=""table"">Table 5</xref>). The descriptive statistical analysis of the axial length (AL) for males and females is shown in <xref rid=""medicina-60-01098-t006"" ref-type=""table"">Table 6</xref>. There was no difference between males and females in relation to axial length (<italic toggle=""yes"">p</italic> = 0.440, 24.13 ± 2.06 mm in males and 23.46 ±1.05 mm in females). The confidence interval level was set to 95% where a corresponding <italic toggle=""yes"">p</italic> value threshold was identified as 0.05. The AL values for children and adults were grouped in three categories, <22 mm, 22–25 mm and >25 mm [<xref rid=""B8-medicina-60-01098"" ref-type=""bibr"">8</xref>], to analyze whether there are differences in distribution based on age in ectopia lentis. The values for age and axial length were analyzed by the Mann–Whitney U test and the differences between groups were not statistically significant (<italic toggle=""yes"">p</italic> = 0.213). These results are presented in <xref rid=""medicina-60-01098-t007"" ref-type=""table"">Table 7</xref>. The single piece IOL design was implanted in group 1 and 2 surgical technique cases, representing 78.8% from the study lot and the three piece IOL was implanted in group 3 and 4, representing 21.2% (<xref rid=""medicina-60-01098-f005"" ref-type=""fig"">Figure 5</xref>A). For the correction of astigmatism, toric IOLs were used in group 1 and in small number of cases (3 out of 22) in group 2 (when the bag was suitable for proper IOL placement and centration) and in all other cases from this group, non-toric IOLs were used. In the surgical technique group 3 and 4, only non-toric IOLs were implanted (<xref rid=""medicina-60-01098-f005"" ref-type=""fig"">Figure 5</xref>B). We considered three categories of preoperative astigmatism: <1.50 Cyl, 1.50–2.50 Cyl and >2.50 Cyl. In the first two categories we only implanted non-toric IOLs. In the third category of preoperative cylinder values >2.50 Cyl, the toric IOL was implanted in six eyes and a non-toric IOL in four eyes (<xref rid=""medicina-60-01098-f005"" ref-type=""fig"">Figure 5</xref>C). In our study, there were two postoperative complications, one of which was major, consisting of the untying of the 10.0 polypropylene suture, leading to notable decentering of the Cionni ring–capsular bag–IOL complex. This required immediate surgical reintervention to replace the suture. The other complication was a slight decentration of the lens without an impact on visual acuity or intraocular pressure. None of the eyes presented pupillary abnormalities due to surgical interventions, except for those associated with Marfan syndrome. Ectopia lentis is the most frequent ocular finding in Marfan syndrome and its surgical correction is considered a challenge due to anatomical and structural alterations of the zonular fibers. Therefore, in order to achieve optimal postoperative results, various surgical approaches were designed and implemented. Usually, a surgeon performs one or two techniques, based on experience, IOL type available and postoperative results; hence most of the studies present postoperative results from up to two surgical techniques [<xref rid=""B9-medicina-60-01098"" ref-type=""bibr"">9</xref>,<xref rid=""B10-medicina-60-01098"" ref-type=""bibr"">10</xref>]. To our knowledge, this is the only study that assesses four surgical techniques employed by the same surgeon to treat ectopia lentis in patients with Marfan syndrome. The gender distribution of patients in the study group showed no significant differences between females and males, with our results being similar to those reported by other authors [<xref rid=""B11-medicina-60-01098"" ref-type=""bibr"">11</xref>,<xref rid=""B12-medicina-60-01098"" ref-type=""bibr"">12</xref>,<xref rid=""B13-medicina-60-01098"" ref-type=""bibr"">13</xref>]. A patient’s age is an important factor in the recommendation to undergo surgery [<xref rid=""B14-medicina-60-01098"" ref-type=""bibr"">14</xref>], selection of the surgical approach and visual prognosis. The mean age of our study group was 17.39 ± 11.75 years, which is not highly different from that reported by Sinha et al., 19.80 years old [<xref rid=""B15-medicina-60-01098"" ref-type=""bibr"">15</xref>]. However, the minimum age of patients in our study was 4 years old, whereas in Sinha’s study it was 16 years old [<xref rid=""B15-medicina-60-01098"" ref-type=""bibr"">15</xref>]. A younger age at the time of surgery is associated with a higher degree of subluxation [<xref rid=""B16-medicina-60-01098"" ref-type=""bibr"">16</xref>]; thus, surgery is recommended as soon as possible due to poor visual acuity. Other factors that influence the timing of surgery are the risk of amblyopia [<xref rid=""B17-medicina-60-01098"" ref-type=""bibr"">17</xref>] and uncertain visual prognosis. The study of Erdogan [<xref rid=""B18-medicina-60-01098"" ref-type=""bibr"">18</xref>] based on a similar number of eyes (35) with a mean age of 12 ± 7.14 and a minimum age of 5 years old, presented three different techniques associated with IOL implantation in the same session. Postoperative results showed a significant improvement of the visual acuity for both children and adults. A thing to remember is that in pediatric patients, visual acuity can be further augmented by amblyopia treatment. Therefore, parents should be warned that the surgery is just the first step in the visual recovery of their children. Our keratometric measurements showed a flat cornea, in accordance with results of previous studies [<xref rid=""B19-medicina-60-01098"" ref-type=""bibr"">19</xref>,<xref rid=""B20-medicina-60-01098"" ref-type=""bibr"">20</xref>,<xref rid=""B21-medicina-60-01098"" ref-type=""bibr"">21</xref>]. Axial length for children and adults had similar results for all three axial length groups, revealing no correlation between age and axial length. A similar conclusion was obtained by Chen in his large study [<xref rid=""B22-medicina-60-01098"" ref-type=""bibr"">22</xref>]. With-the-rule astigmatism was the most frequent type in both children and adults, followed by oblique astigmatism; findings also reported by Chen [<xref rid=""B22-medicina-60-01098"" ref-type=""bibr"">22</xref>]. None of our patients had against-the-rule astigmatism, which was found by Chen in 11.2% of his cases [<xref rid=""B22-medicina-60-01098"" ref-type=""bibr"">22</xref>]. A possible explanation could be attributed to the large number of eyes (215 eyes) enrolled in Chen’s study compared to ours. In Marfan syndrome, ectopia lentis is caused by fibrillin abnormalities [<xref rid=""B17-medicina-60-01098"" ref-type=""bibr"">17</xref>], which induce an abnormal lens movement (phacodonesis). In ectopia lentis surgery, phacodonesis and the lack of zonular counter tension make it more difficult to perform capsulorhexis, aspiration and phacoemulsification. Furthermore, in children and young adults the capsular bag is more elastic, which makes capsulorhexis even more difficult [<xref rid=""B23-medicina-60-01098"" ref-type=""bibr"">23</xref>]. Among the four types of surgical techniques assessed in our study, the one that implies suturing the intraocular lens to the sclera was more frequent in children (four children and one adult), because younger ages associate with a higher degree of lens subluxation, which impedes capsular bag preservation [<xref rid=""B15-medicina-60-01098"" ref-type=""bibr"">15</xref>]. On the other hand, the technique that entails bag stabilization using a simple capsular tension ring was only used in adults (four cases), justified by the lower degree of lens subluxation in this age group; this provided a good visual acuity, which postpones the surgery. In our study, the most frequent technique involved the suture of a modified capsular tension ring to the sclera, followed by intraocular lens implantation. Although this represents a surgical challenge even in the hands of an experienced surgeon, we considered it the best approach in ectopia lentis surgery. Chen also believed that using a modified capsular tension ring was the best option in ectopia lentis surgery [<xref rid=""B13-medicina-60-01098"" ref-type=""bibr"">13</xref>]. In the study of Erdogan et al., three different techniques were compared (intrascleral fixation of IOL, scleral IOL fixation with the Z-suture and IOL implantation with the use of a Cionni m-CTR), with no significant differences in terms of postoperative results and complications [<xref rid=""B18-medicina-60-01098"" ref-type=""bibr"">18</xref>]. The preferred surgical approach of Halpert in young children with ectopia lentis was pars plana or limbal lensectomy [<xref rid=""B23-medicina-60-01098"" ref-type=""bibr"">23</xref>]. The resulting aphakia was corrected afterwards by contact lenses or eyeglasses. These methods for correcting aphakia in children have many disadvantages [<xref rid=""B24-medicina-60-01098"" ref-type=""bibr"">24</xref>]: eyeglasses—poor vision, narrowed visual field, hard to wear and contact lenses—expensive, hard to wear, risk of irritation and infections. Rezar-Dreindl et al. analyzed the visual outcome in children with ectopia lentis in Marfan syndrome after lensectomy (with/without IOL implantation) or conservative treatment, showing an improvement in both methods (83% vs. 75%) [<xref rid=""B25-medicina-60-01098"" ref-type=""bibr"">25</xref>]. Other approaches cited in the literature are artisan lens implantation, iris sutured IOL and sutureless scleral fixation, but none of these are considered as the gold standard [<xref rid=""B26-medicina-60-01098"" ref-type=""bibr"">26</xref>,<xref rid=""B27-medicina-60-01098"" ref-type=""bibr"">27</xref>,<xref rid=""B28-medicina-60-01098"" ref-type=""bibr"">28</xref>]. Postoperative visual acuity is increased by correcting preoperative astigmatism with toric intraocular lenses. In our study, in 6 out of 10 cases where preoperative cylinder was higher than 2.50 D we successfully implanted a toric intraocular lens. The surgical technique imposed both the type (toric or non-toric) and design of the intraocular lens implanted. Toric intraocular lenses were only implanted in those cases where the capsular bag was stabilized by simple or modified capsular tension rings. One important concern was the preservation of the capsular bag, which was accomplished in 28 eyes (out of the total of 33 eyes). In these 28 eyes, we implanted a single- piece intraocular lens in 26 eyes and a three-piece intraocular lens in 2 eyes. In 5 eyes the bag could not be preserved due to a high degree of subluxation. In these cases, we sutured a three-piece intraocular lens to the sclera. A single-piece intraocular lens could also be sutured to the sclera, but the design of the three-piece is more appropriate for this technique. In our study there were two postoperative complications. The most serious was the untying of the 10.0 polypropylene suture resulting in a significant decentration of the Cionni ring—capsular bag—IOL complex, imposing surgical reintervention to replace the suture. The other complication was a slight decentration of the lens without impact on visual acuity or intraocular pressure. The drawbacks of the study were the short follow-up time and the relatively small number and uneven distribution of patients in the four groups of techniques. The surgical correction of ectopia lentis is considered a challenge due to anatomical and structural alterations of the zonular fibers. Our study evaluated four different surgical techniques for ectopia lentis in children and adults, in terms of postoperative visual acuity and complications. The most frequent technique, which in our opinion best reconstructs the zonular anatomy, involved the suture of a modified capsular tension ring to the sclera, followed by in-the-bag intraocular lens implantation. In adults with a mild degree of lens subluxation, bag stabilization was possible only using a simple capsular tension ring. Suturing the intraocular lens to the sclera was performed in those cases with severe lens subluxation, mostly in children. The least applied technique was the IOL implantation with one haptic in the bag and one haptic sutured to the sclera. Regardless of the technique employed the postoperative visual acuity was improved in both adults and children.",N/A,05 7 2024
Coding and Non-Coding Transcriptomic Landscape of Aortic Complications in Marfan Syndrome,"Marfan syndrome (MFS) is a rare congenital disorder of the connective tissue, leading to thoracic aortic aneurysms (TAA) and dissection, among other complications. Currently, the most efficient strategy to prevent life-threatening dissection is preventive surgery. Periodic imaging applying complex techniques is required to monitor TAA progression and to guide the timing of surgical intervention. Thus, there is an acute demand for non-invasive biomarkers for diagnosis and prognosis, as well as for innovative therapeutic targets of MFS. Unraveling the intricate pathomolecular mechanisms underlying the syndrome is vital to address these needs. High-throughput platforms are particularly well-suited for this purpose, as they enable the integration of different datasets, such as transcriptomic and epigenetic profiles. In this narrative review, we summarize relevant studies investigating changes in both the coding and non-coding transcriptome and epigenome in MFS-induced TAA. The collective findings highlight the implicated pathways, such as TGF-β signaling, extracellular matrix structure, inflammation, and mitochondrial dysfunction. Potential candidates as biomarkers, such as miR-200c, as well as therapeutic targets emerged, like Tfam, associated with mitochondrial respiration, or miR-632, stimulating endothelial-to-mesenchymal transition. While these discoveries are promising, rigorous and extensive validation in large patient cohorts is indispensable to confirm their clinical relevance and therapeutic potential.","Aneurysms of the thoracic aorta (TAA) are a consequence of the necrosis or degeneration of the cystic layer of the arterial wall, which is characterized by a decrease in smooth muscle cells (SMC), breakdown of elastin fibers, and an increase in the deposition of proteoglycans in the tunica media of the aortic wall [<xref rid=""B1-ijms-25-07367"" ref-type=""bibr"">1</xref>]. TAA are often defined by the location and degree of aortic involvement: most TAA arise in the aortic root or ascending aorta (60%), followed by descending aorta (40%), aortic arch and, lastly, thoracoabdominal aorta [<xref rid=""B2-ijms-25-07367"" ref-type=""bibr"">2</xref>]. Although the majority of TAA have degenerative etiology and the concurrent presence of cardiovascular risk factors, about 5% of TAA, especially in the ascending aorta, are linked to genetic conditions affecting connective tissue and familial predisposition [<xref rid=""B2-ijms-25-07367"" ref-type=""bibr"">2</xref>]. In this regard, up to 20% of those who are typically affected have a first-degree relative who has a dilated thoracic aorta [<xref rid=""B1-ijms-25-07367"" ref-type=""bibr"">1</xref>,<xref rid=""B3-ijms-25-07367"" ref-type=""bibr"">3</xref>,<xref rid=""B4-ijms-25-07367"" ref-type=""bibr"">4</xref>]. In the presence of familial patterns, clinical guidelines identify TAA based on the presence or absence of syndromic aortic aneurysm conditions, such as Marfan syndrome (MFS, OMIM #154700), Loeys–Dietz syndrome (LDS, OMIM #609192), or vascular Ehlers–Danlos syndrome (vEDS, OMIM #130050). For a better understating of the genetic involvement in syndromic TAA, mutations in the gene that encodes the Fibrillin-1 protein (FBN1) are mainly associated with MFS. A different group of genes encoding the transforming growth factor beta (TGF-β) signaling pathway (TGF-β receptors 1 and 2 (TGFBR1, TGFBR2), TGFB2, TGFB3, similar to Mothers Against Decapentaplegic 2 and 3 (SMAD2, SMAD3) and Sloan–Kettering Institute Proto-Oncogene (SKI)) give rise to TGF-β-related vascular disorders, which are linked to LDS (especially TGFBR1 or TGFBR2 mutations), vEDS (mutations in collagen type III alpha 1 chain gene (COL3A1)) and predispose patients to aggressive and widespread vascular conditions [<xref rid=""B5-ijms-25-07367"" ref-type=""bibr"">5</xref>]. Predominant phenotypes related to connective tissue disorders (CTDs) encompass manifestations in the skin, musculoskeletal, visual, craniofacial, and cardiovascular systems [<xref rid=""B6-ijms-25-07367"" ref-type=""bibr"">6</xref>], occasionally accompanied by functional impairment. Research revealed that about 30% of families affected by heritable thoracic aortic diseases (HTAD), without a confirmed diagnosis of MFS or a similar syndrome, carry a responsible, disease-causing genetic mutation within the recognized HTAD-related genes (for example, Actin Alpha 2 (ACTA2), myosin heavy chain 11 (MYH11), myosin light chain kinase (MYLK), notch receptor 1 (NOTCH1) and similar, as reported by Milewicz et al.) [<xref rid=""B7-ijms-25-07367"" ref-type=""bibr"">7</xref>,<xref rid=""B8-ijms-25-07367"" ref-type=""bibr"">8</xref>]. With the widespread adoption of whole exome sequencing among TAA patients and their relatives, new pathological and potentially significant genetic variations are being identified on a regular basis [<xref rid=""B8-ijms-25-07367"" ref-type=""bibr"">8</xref>]. In nonsyndromic TAA, abnormalities are limited to the cardiovascular system. The majority of these conditions show autosomal dominant inheritance, but affected individuals do not exhibit external features of CTD or any other recurrent phenotype as in syndromic TAA [<xref rid=""B6-ijms-25-07367"" ref-type=""bibr"">6</xref>]. Conditions that are usually considered nonsyndromic include familial thoracic aneurysms and dissections (also known as familial TAA), as well as TAA with bicuspid aortic valve (BAV) [<xref rid=""B6-ijms-25-07367"" ref-type=""bibr"">6</xref>]. In contrast to abdominal aortic aneurysms, there is no general population screening protocol for TAA [<xref rid=""B1-ijms-25-07367"" ref-type=""bibr"">1</xref>]. The identification of TAA commonly occurs as an unintended discovery and, to a lesser degree, through systematic examination [<xref rid=""B9-ijms-25-07367"" ref-type=""bibr"">9</xref>]. Different sets of symptoms may arise depending on the size and location of the TAA. Over 95% of TAA do not show symptoms until they reach the point of dissection or rupture [<xref rid=""B10-ijms-25-07367"" ref-type=""bibr"">10</xref>]. Nevertheless, guidelines suggest screening close family members of individuals with a history of TAA or aortic dissection. In cases where there is substantial evidence of a familial TAA, considering screening second-degree relatives is justified. It may also be reasonable to screen for TAA in patients whose first-degree relatives have experienced unexplained sudden cardiac death [<xref rid=""B11-ijms-25-07367"" ref-type=""bibr"">11</xref>,<xref rid=""B12-ijms-25-07367"" ref-type=""bibr"">12</xref>]. Regardless of its size, the onset of symptoms linked to TAA should lead to an immediate assessment for surgical intervention. Due to the high occurrence of aneurysms in locations beyond the thoracic aorta among patients with familial TAA, computed tomography angiography (CTA) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) are recommended for entire morphological evaluation aorta [<xref rid=""B1-ijms-25-07367"" ref-type=""bibr"">1</xref>]. A transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) should be performed to check for valve-related conditions. It is advisable, according to current guidelines, to begin screening with imaging around the age of 25 or 10 years before the earliest case in a family group [<xref rid=""B1-ijms-25-07367"" ref-type=""bibr"">1</xref>,<xref rid=""B13-ijms-25-07367"" ref-type=""bibr"">13</xref>]. If the initial screening results are normal, follow-up imaging should be done at 5-year intervals. Instrumental diagnosis with TTE is the method of choice for assessing and following up on the diameters of the aortic root, ascending aorta, aortic arch, and descending aorta [<xref rid=""B1-ijms-25-07367"" ref-type=""bibr"">1</xref>]. Therefore, periodic imaging of TAA should be performed to determine the necessity and timing of prophylactic surgery. To date, preemptive surgical correction of TAA is the most efficient approach to prevent aortic rupture and dissection [<xref rid=""B14-ijms-25-07367"" ref-type=""bibr"">14</xref>,<xref rid=""B15-ijms-25-07367"" ref-type=""bibr"">15</xref>], proving successful repair of TAA and long-term survival rates when compared to controls of similar age and gender. Recommendations outlined in guidelines regarding the criteria for considering proactive intervention are founded on the current knowledge of TAAs’ natural progression and the associated surgical risks [<xref rid=""B14-ijms-25-07367"" ref-type=""bibr"">14</xref>]. Aside from prophylactic surgery, medical treatment has been reported to slow the rate of aortic enlargement [<xref rid=""B1-ijms-25-07367"" ref-type=""bibr"">1</xref>,<xref rid=""B14-ijms-25-07367"" ref-type=""bibr"">14</xref>]. Recommendations for syndromic patients, especially in MFS, include beta blockers, which have proved efficacy in slowing the expansion of TAA. Current guidelines advocate for the administration of beta blockers to all MFS patients to reduce the rate of aortic enlargement [<xref rid=""B14-ijms-25-07367"" ref-type=""bibr"">14</xref>]. Despite their specific indication, beta blockers are frequently prescribed to TAA patients without MFS (<xref rid=""ijms-25-07367-f001"" ref-type=""fig"">Figure 1</xref>). More recently, Angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARB) have been found to reduce the progression of aortic dilation in MFS patients. This discovery has prompted guideline recommendations for ARB in all MFS patients and preclinical data suggest potential benefits for LDS, likewise [<xref rid=""B14-ijms-25-07367"" ref-type=""bibr"">14</xref>]. However, similar to beta blockers, there is limited evidence supporting the efficacy of ARB in patients with TAA who do not have MFS or LDS [<xref rid=""B1-ijms-25-07367"" ref-type=""bibr"">1</xref>]. To date, gold standard diagnostic techniques for MFS focus on the use of TTE, CT scan, and MRI [<xref rid=""B9-ijms-25-07367"" ref-type=""bibr"">9</xref>]. Biomarkers allowing early detection of disease progression in TAA would represent an important advance for the prognosis and management of the disease. For the narrative review, literature research was conducted by employing the medical databases “PubMed” and “Scopus” as well as the search engine “Google Scholar”. The following keywords were applied: “thoracic aorta aneurysm”, “TAA”; “Marfan syndrome”, “MFS”; “transcriptomic”; “RNAseq”, “single-cell RNAseq”; “microarray”, “high-throughput”; “epigenetic”; “non-coding RNA”; “miRNA”; “lnRNA”; “biomarker”. All these search terms were also used in combination with the Boolean operators AND and OR, along with other diseases described in this review: “Loeys–Dietz syndrome” or “LDS”, “vascular Ehlers–Danlos syndrome” or “vEDS”, “bicuspid aortic valve” or “BAV”. We considered relevant publications from 2007 until May 2024. Other articles were selected from the reference list of the retrieved publications. The unmet need for non-invasive biomarkers for both the diagnosis and the prognosis of complex diseases such as MFS underscores the utility of high-throughput platforms. These techniques permit a simultaneous analysis of various aspects of a disease. For instance, a seroproteomic approach enables the concurrent measurement of a multitude of cytokines and chemokines, while an epigenetic approach facilitates the identification of chromatin modifications associated with pathological conditions. Particularly promising is the transcriptomic approach, exploiting the entire transcriptome, constituted by both coding (messenger RNAs, mRNAs) and non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs), such as microRNAs (miRNAs), long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs), and circular RNAs (circRNAs). Pioneering transcriptome studies of aortic aneurysms from MFS patients have demonstrated the potential to identify differentially expressed mRNAs, miRNAs, and lncRNAs that may play crucial roles in the pathogenic mechanisms of the disease (<xref rid=""ijms-25-07367-f002"" ref-type=""fig"">Figure 2</xref>). Epigenetics is the study of stable and hereditary changes regulating gene expression without altering the DNA sequence, such as DNA methylation [<xref rid=""B91-ijms-25-07367"" ref-type=""bibr"">91</xref>], histone modification [<xref rid=""B92-ijms-25-07367"" ref-type=""bibr"">92</xref>], and post-transcriptional regulation of ncRNA [<xref rid=""B93-ijms-25-07367"" ref-type=""bibr"">93</xref>,<xref rid=""B94-ijms-25-07367"" ref-type=""bibr"">94</xref>]. Such changes can have a strong effect on the recruitment of transcription factors and on the downstream transcriptional machinery [<xref rid=""B95-ijms-25-07367"" ref-type=""bibr"">95</xref>,<xref rid=""B96-ijms-25-07367"" ref-type=""bibr"">96</xref>,<xref rid=""B97-ijms-25-07367"" ref-type=""bibr"">97</xref>,<xref rid=""B98-ijms-25-07367"" ref-type=""bibr"">98</xref>,<xref rid=""B99-ijms-25-07367"" ref-type=""bibr"">99</xref>], with consequences for numerous biological processes and diseases, such as CVD [<xref rid=""B100-ijms-25-07367"" ref-type=""bibr"">100</xref>,<xref rid=""B101-ijms-25-07367"" ref-type=""bibr"">101</xref>]. Techniques to study epigenetic changes include the treatment of DNA with bisulfite. During this process, unmethylated cytosines are deaminated to uracil, while methylated cytosines remain unchanged. This allows for the distinction and quantification of methylated from unmethylated cytosines in genomic DNA, which can be achieved using either microarrays or deep sequencing. Another method for studying epigenetics is the Assay for Transposase Accessible Chromatin with high-throughput sequencing (ATAC-seq). It employs an engineered, hyperactive Tn5 transposase to cut open chromatin and insert sequencing adapters simultaneously. These tagged DNA fragments are then sequenced and mapped, providing information about chromatin accessibility at a genome-wide scale. This method can be combined with single-cell sequencing (Single-cell ATAC-seq). In 2021, van Andel performed the first epigenome-wide association study (EWAS) with peripheral whole blood from nearly 200 MFS patients [<xref rid=""B102-ijms-25-07367"" ref-type=""bibr"">102</xref>]. DNA-methylation arrays were utilized to investigate methylation of CpG-sites across the entire genome. Among differentially methylated positions (DMP), 28 showed significant correlation with aortic diameters in patients, and 7 of these were associated with CVD-relevant genes (histone deacetylase 4 (HDAC4), insulin-like growth factor 2 mRNA binding protein 3 (IGF2BP3), castor zinc finger 1 (CASZ1), sidekick cell adhesion molecule 1 (SDK1), protocadherin gamma subfamily A (PCDHGA1), iodothyronine deiodinase 3 (DIO3), and protein tyrosine phosphatase receptor type N2 (PTPRN2)). Moreover, several DMPs were significantly correlated with changes in the aortic diameter or with clinical events. Further investigation of differentially methylated regions uncovered a gene cluster of protocadherins on chromosome 5, not reported before in MFS. This cluster includes genes related to cell adhesion, suggesting potential functional involvement. However, their specific relevance is yet to be determined. Interestingly, no methylation loci in the FBN1 gene vicinity are associated with the MFS phenotype. Noteworthy, no significant correlations were observed with non-cardiovascular phenotypic features of MFS, indicating specificity of the identified DMPs. This study offers novel insights into the epigenetic architecture of MFS. However, to confirm and extend these findings, it is essential to evaluate the functional relevance of the identified loci and replicate the study in other MFS populations. Although the pathological consequences of the FBN1 mutation are systematic, aneurysms observed in MFS patients are usually located in the aortic root, while adjacent ascending aorta and arch remain unchanged. Researchers hypothesized that this difference is due to different embryological origins, specifically the cardiac second heart field (SHF) and neural crest [<xref rid=""B103-ijms-25-07367"" ref-type=""bibr"">103</xref>]. To investigate these complex mechanisms, a SHF lineage-traced Fbn1<sup>C1041G/+</sup> strain was generated, followed by integrated multi-omics analysis (scRNA-seq and ATAC-seq), stratified by embryological origin. SMC phenotypic modulation associated with MFS aneurysm was identified in both SHF and neural crest-derived cells. However, transcriptomic responses showed differences between lineages. SMCs with SHF origin overexpressed collagen synthetic genes and small leucine-rich proteoglycans, while SMCs with neural crest origin activated chondrogenic genes. These findings suggest that overactivation of the collagen synthetic pathway in SHF-derived SMC may contribute to the collagen depositions in the aortic root of MFS patients [<xref rid=""B88-ijms-25-07367"" ref-type=""bibr"">88</xref>], thereby promoting focal aortic root aneurysm formation. Integrated scRNA-seq and ATAC-seq analysis identified the enrichment of Twist1 and Smad2/3/4 complex binding motifs in SHF-derived modulated SMC. These findings are particularly intriguing since activation of the TGF-β-Smad2/3/4 signaling axis is known to participate in aneurysm progression in murine MFS models [<xref rid=""B35-ijms-25-07367"" ref-type=""bibr"">35</xref>,<xref rid=""B104-ijms-25-07367"" ref-type=""bibr"">104</xref>]. Moreover, transcription factor twist family basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor 1 (TWIST1) has been implicated in pathological fibrosis [<xref rid=""B105-ijms-25-07367"" ref-type=""bibr"">105</xref>], the silencing of SMC contractile genes [<xref rid=""B106-ijms-25-07367"" ref-type=""bibr"">106</xref>], and the modulation of the SMC phenotype in coronary artery disease [<xref rid=""B107-ijms-25-07367"" ref-type=""bibr"">107</xref>]. TWIST1 overexpression caused an increase in collagen and SLRP in vitro, suggesting a TWIST1-driven increase in collagen synthesis in SHF-derived SMC in MFS aneurysm. Collectively, the integrated multi-omics approach revealed that the embryologic origin influences the transcriptional response of SMC phenotype modulation in TAA of MFS. Additionally, transcription factor TWIST1 was discovered as a promising target for further mechanistic investigation. Comparing studies with other congenital TAA can offer valuable insights. Firstly, it aids in identifying unique gene expression or methylation patterns specific to MFS, shedding light on the underlying molecular mechanisms of MFS pathogenesis. Secondly, it may unveil common molecular pathways and genetic signatures contributing to aneurysm formation and progression across different forms of congenital TAA. Currently, reliable predictors of the clinical severity and long-term outcome of MFS, as well as etiological therapies, are lacking. A comprehensive understanding of both the coding and non-coding transcriptomic landscape, along with epigenetic regulation down to the single-cell level, has contributed significantly to deciphering the underlying molecular pathomechanisms. This has shed light on key members of involved pathways, moving them into researchers’ focus as potential candidates for biomarkers and potential targets for RNA therapy. Several studies on tissue samples from mouse models and MFS patients have identified promising target genes that could prevent the deterioration of aortic aneurysms, such as Tfam, which is crucial for mitochondrial respiration, and miR-632, which is involved in Wnt/β-catenin signaling, End-Mt, and fibrosis, as well as miR-122, associated with the inflammatory response. In contrast, only a very limited number of transcriptomic or epigenetic studies have been conducted on the peripheral blood of MFS patients (<xref rid=""ijms-25-07367-t001"" ref-type=""table"">Table 1</xref>). Among these, miRNA-200c, previously linked to cardiovascular disease, emerged as a biomarker candidate, showing a strong correlation with the status of the aortic root (Z-score). However, further studies applying a multi-omics approach with larger patient cohorts are essential. Investigating rare diseases poses challenges, as access to patient samples is limited, often resulting in underpowered studies. Establishing specialized MFS centers and concentrating clinical and research efforts in a single location could help to overcome this obstacle.",N/A,05 7 2024
Targeted next‐generation sequencing reveals the genetic mechanism of Chinese Marfan syndrome cohort with ocular manifestation," The study aimed to expand the understanding of Marfan syndrome (MFS) and its genetic basis.

","Marfan syndrome (MFS, OMIM: 154700) is a rare hereditary disorder of fibrous connective tissue, exhibiting significant clinical variability and pleiotropism. MFS is characterized by multiple organ system abnormalities, including skeletal, ophthalmologic, and cardiovascular systems (Bitterman & Sponseller, <xref rid=""mgg32482-bib-0004"" ref-type=""bibr"">2017</xref>; Pyeritz & McKusick, <xref rid=""mgg32482-bib-0021"" ref-type=""bibr"">1979</xref>). Symptoms of MFS include increased height, generalized ligamentous and joint laxity, scoliosis, anterior chest deformity, dislocation or subluxation of crystals, myopia, glaucoma, dural ectasia, tooth deformity, widening or atrophic skin texture, aorta idiopathic dilation, cerebrovascular malformation, and pulmonary blebs (Brown et al., <xref rid=""mgg32482-bib-0005"" ref-type=""bibr"">1975</xref>; Newman & Tilley, <xref rid=""mgg32482-bib-0018"" ref-type=""bibr"">1979</xref>; Pyeritz & McKusick, <xref rid=""mgg32482-bib-0021"" ref-type=""bibr"">1979</xref>; Sponseller et al., <xref rid=""mgg32482-bib-0026"" ref-type=""bibr"">1995</xref>; Weir, <xref rid=""mgg32482-bib-0029"" ref-type=""bibr"">1973</xref>; Westling et al., <xref rid=""mgg32482-bib-0030"" ref-type=""bibr"">1998</xref>). It is suggested that the biochemical basis of MFS is the abnormality of connective tissue proteins or ground substances, including collagen primary structure abnormalities and hyaluronic acid synthesis (Appel et al., <xref rid=""mgg32482-bib-0001"" ref-type=""bibr"">1979</xref>; Byers et al., <xref rid=""mgg32482-bib-0007"" ref-type=""bibr"">1981</xref>; Pyeritz & McKusick, <xref rid=""mgg32482-bib-0022"" ref-type=""bibr"">1981</xref>). This disorder can present as an isolated condition or may coexist with other medical complications, including cardiovascular diseases, ocular lesions, and neurological disorders. MFS typically presents with a family history and is inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern in most cases (Mc, <xref rid=""mgg32482-bib-0015"" ref-type=""bibr"">1955</xref>). Previous studies have indicated that patients with MFS exhibit clinical heterogeneity, with the most severely affected patients appearing to be sporadic mutations, while familial patients have milder manifestations (Morse et al., <xref rid=""mgg32482-bib-0017"" ref-type=""bibr"">1990</xref>). No gender or ethnicity biases have been reported, although sporadic patients are more likely to have severe and early‐onset symptoms (Buntinx et al., <xref rid=""mgg32482-bib-0006"" ref-type=""bibr"">1991</xref>; Verstraeten et al., <xref rid=""mgg32482-bib-0028"" ref-type=""bibr"">2016</xref>). Furthermore, the clinical variability and heterogeneity of MFS provide a huge challenge for medical professionals in correctly diagnosing the disorder. Currently, there is no specific treatment for MFS, and it can only be managed through medication and surgery to alleviate symptoms. Most patients succumb to complications such as aortic aneurysm rupture and heart failure at the middle age. Therefore, it is crucial to enhance our understanding of the pathogenesis and genetic mechanisms underlying MFS. MFS is caused by the mutations of the fibrillin‐1 gene (<italic toggle=""yes"">FBN1</italic>, OMIM: 134797) on chromosome 15q21, which is composed of 66 exons and encodes a 350‐kDa important structural protein–fibrillin‐1 (Verstraeten et al., <xref rid=""mgg32482-bib-0028"" ref-type=""bibr"">2016</xref>). Fibrillin‐1 is the primary constituent of microfibrils, which are widely distributed throughout connective tissues in the body and assembled into tissue‐specific architectural frameworks, particularly in the cardiovascular and musculoskeletal systems. In addition to a signal peptide, fibrillin‐1 is arranged in three structurally distinct regions, including 47 six‐cysteine epidermal growth factor (EGF)‐like domains, seven transforming growth factor (TGF)‐β‐binding domains, and a cysteine‐rich and proline‐rich domain (Pereira et al., <xref rid=""mgg32482-bib-0020"" ref-type=""bibr"">1993</xref>; Ramachandra et al., <xref rid=""mgg32482-bib-0023"" ref-type=""bibr"">2015</xref>). The EGF‐like and TGF‐β‐binding domains have a critical role in protein structure stability through covalent bonds of three disulfide bridges. Mutations in the <italic toggle=""yes"">FBN1</italic> gene result in a significant deficiency of fibrillin‐1 and a disorder of microfibril structure. This deficiency of fibrillin‐1 can also lead to an increase in TGF‐b, and excessive signaling and activation of TGF‐b have been identified as the primary cause of MFS (Benke et al., <xref rid=""mgg32482-bib-0002"" ref-type=""bibr"">2013</xref>). MFS has been associated with over a thousand individual mutations in the <italic toggle=""yes"">FBN1</italic> gene (Lu et al., <xref rid=""mgg32482-bib-0013"" ref-type=""bibr"">2024</xref>), and mutations in specific regions of <italic toggle=""yes"">FBN1</italic> can also result in disorders such as Weill‐Marchesani syndrome or other acromelic dysplasias that exhibit features opposite to MFS (Faivre et al., <xref rid=""mgg32482-bib-0009"" ref-type=""bibr"">2003</xref>). As a result, establishing clear genotype–phenotype correlations between <italic toggle=""yes"">FBN1</italic> mutations and MFS has been challenging. Building on foundational genetic insights, our study further elucidates the mutation spectrum of the FBN1 gene, employing advanced panel‐based next‐generation sequencing (NGS) techniques (Lu et al., <xref rid=""mgg32482-bib-0013"" ref-type=""bibr"">2024</xref>). However, these reported mutations cannot entirely account for the pathogenesis of all MFS patients. Although heterozygous mutations in the <italic toggle=""yes"">FBN1</italic> gene are responsible for almost all cases of MFS, there are other Marfan‐like disorders that exhibit similar clinical phenotypes (Verstraeten et al., <xref rid=""mgg32482-bib-0028"" ref-type=""bibr"">2016</xref>). These disorders include Loeys‐Dietz syndrome (LDS, OMIM: 609192, 610168, 61486, 615582), Shprintzen‐Goldberg syndrome (SGS, OMIM: 182212), Ehlers‐Danlos syndrome (EDS, OMIM: 130000, 130050, 225400), Stickler syndrome (STL, OMIM: 108300), and contractural arachnodactyly (CCA, OMIM: 121050). Distinguishing these disorders from MFS through clinical diagnosis can be challenging. LDS is a systemic aortic aneurysm syndrome and was first recognized as a separate disease in 2005 (Loeys et al., <xref rid=""mgg32482-bib-0012"" ref-type=""bibr"">2005</xref>). Compared with MFS, the cardiovascular manifestations in LDS tend to be more severe and present at an earlier onset age. Some LDS subtypes also exhibit to ocular phenotype similar to MFS and are associated with pathogenic genes such as <italic toggle=""yes"">TGFBR1</italic>, <italic toggle=""yes"">TGFBR2</italic>, <italic toggle=""yes"">TGFB2</italic>, and <italic toggle=""yes"">TGFB3</italic> (Bertoli‐Avella et al., <xref rid=""mgg32482-bib-0003"" ref-type=""bibr"">2015</xref>; Lindsay et al., <xref rid=""mgg32482-bib-0011"" ref-type=""bibr"">2012</xref>; Loeys et al., <xref rid=""mgg32482-bib-0012"" ref-type=""bibr"">2005</xref>; Stheneur et al., <xref rid=""mgg32482-bib-0027"" ref-type=""bibr"">2008</xref>). Conversely, SGS is characterized by a Marfanoid habitus and encompasses almost all of the cardiovascular, skeletal, ocular, skin, and craniofacial features observed in MFS. Additionally, SGS can also present with mental retardation and skeletal muscle hypotonia, which are not observed in MFS (Shprintzen & Goldberg, <xref rid=""mgg32482-bib-0025"" ref-type=""bibr"">1982</xref>). Evidence indicates that SGS is caused by heterozygous mutations in the <italic toggle=""yes"">SKI</italic> gene (Carmignac et al., <xref rid=""mgg32482-bib-0008"" ref-type=""bibr"">2012</xref>). Similarly, EDS refers to a group of heritable connective tissue disorders that share the common clinical features of articular hypermobility, tissue fragility, and skin hyperextensibility (Malfait et al., <xref rid=""mgg32482-bib-0014"" ref-type=""bibr"">2017</xref>). Some EDS subtypes present with symptoms typical of MFS, including myopia, lens abnormalities, congenital hip dislocation, recurrent joint subluxations, and cardiovascular diseases. Pathogenic genes associated with these subtypes include <italic toggle=""yes"">COL3A1</italic>, <italic toggle=""yes"">COL5A1</italic>, and <italic toggle=""yes"">PLOD1</italic> (Hautala et al., <xref rid=""mgg32482-bib-0010"" ref-type=""bibr"">1992</xref>; Nicholls et al., <xref rid=""mgg32482-bib-0019"" ref-type=""bibr"">1996</xref>; Schwarze et al., <xref rid=""mgg32482-bib-0024"" ref-type=""bibr"">1997</xref>). Contractual arachnodactyly also shares overlapping features with MFS, including ocular manifestation, and is caused by the mutations of the FBN2 gene. The <italic toggle=""yes"">FBN2</italic> gene is highly structurally similar to the <italic toggle=""yes"">FBN1</italic> gene, with the main difference being that the <italic toggle=""yes"">FBN1</italic> gene contains a proline‐rich domain while the <italic toggle=""yes"">FBN2</italic> gene contains a glycine‐rich domain (Zhang et al., <xref rid=""mgg32482-bib-0031"" ref-type=""bibr"">1994</xref>). In addition, some genes such as <italic toggle=""yes"">FLNA</italic>, <italic toggle=""yes"">KCNQ1</italic>, <italic toggle=""yes"">LTBP2</italic>, <italic toggle=""yes"">MED12</italic>, <italic toggle=""yes"">MYH11</italic>, <italic toggle=""yes"">MYLK</italic>, <italic toggle=""yes"">NOTCH1</italic>, and <italic toggle=""yes"">SLC2A10</italic> are listed as potentially related to MFS in the ClinVar database. However, limited evidence currently exists to support their association with the disease. Therefore, further studies are needed to gain a better understanding of the genetic mechanism of MFS. In our study, we extended the mutation spectrum of the <italic toggle=""yes"">FBN1</italic> gene and systematically studied whether mutations in the genes mentioned above affect patients with MFS in cohorts by using panel‐based NGS. None of the 17 sporadic cases or families analyzed in this study exhibited mutations in the <italic toggle=""yes"">FBN1</italic> gene. However, we identified mutations in other Marfan‐related genes, including four pathogenic or likely pathogenic mutations in the <italic toggle=""yes"">LTBP2</italic> gene. This observation indicates that variants in the <italic toggle=""yes"">LTBP2</italic> gene may contribute to the ocular manifestations observed in some patients with MFS, underscoring its potential role in the phenotypic diversity of the condition. We identified a total of 181 mutations, including 94 novel mutations, resulting in an overall mutation detection rate of 86.4%. The most prevalent pathogenic or likely pathogenic mutation is a missense mutation <italic toggle=""yes"">FBN1</italic> c.4096G>A. Furthermore, we identified 13 de novo heterozygous mutations in 14 families with MFS.   MFS is a rare genetic disorder affecting fibrous connective tissue, which can cause severe symptoms in a patient's skeletal, ophthalmic, and cardiovascular systems (Bitterman & Sponseller, <xref rid=""mgg32482-bib-0004"" ref-type=""bibr"">2017</xref>; Pyeritz & McKusick, <xref rid=""mgg32482-bib-0021"" ref-type=""bibr"">1979</xref>). Previous studies have revealed that almost all cases of MFS are caused by mutations in the <italic toggle=""yes"">FBN1</italic> gene (Lu et al., <xref rid=""mgg32482-bib-0013"" ref-type=""bibr"">2024</xref>; Verstraeten et al., <xref rid=""mgg32482-bib-0028"" ref-type=""bibr"">2016</xref>). While a few studies have identified pathogenic gene mutations that overlap with MFS in affected individuals (Mizuguchi et al., <xref rid=""mgg32482-bib-0016"" ref-type=""bibr"">2004</xref>; Stheneur et al., <xref rid=""mgg32482-bib-0027"" ref-type=""bibr"">2008</xref>), and some have even documented evidence of other MFS‐related genes on the Clinvar database, none have explored the pathogenic or genetic mechanisms of these genes in MFS patients, particularly those with ocular manifestations. Our study used panel‐based NGS to identify mutations in the <italic toggle=""yes"">FBN1</italic> gene and other Marfan‐related genes associated with MFS in patients with ocular manifestations. This study recruited a total of 318 participants, consisting of 195 cases and 123 controls, which included 59 sporadic cases and 88 families (88 probands and their family members). Among the 181 mutations detected, 94 were found to be novel, and 12 were de novo mutations. These mutations, which were unevenly distributed across the <italic toggle=""yes"">FBN1</italic> gene and 13 other genes associated with MFS, were found to have the highest percentage (53.0%, 96/181) in <italic toggle=""yes"">FBN1</italic>, which is consistent with earlier research findings that <italic toggle=""yes"">FBN1</italic> is the primary pathogenic gene of MFS. Of these 181 mutations, 165 (91.0%) were missense mutations, 10 (5.6%) were splicing mutations, 3 (1.6%) were frameshift mutations, and 3 (1.6%) were nonsense mutations. Furthermore, the ACMG classified these mutations into four different types: 16 (8.8%) were pathogenic mutations, 38 (21.0%) were likely pathogenic mutations, 112 (61.9%) were of uncertain significance, and 11 (8.6%) were likely benign mutations. The overall mutation detection yield is 86.4% (127/147), which is higher than that seen in the <italic toggle=""yes"">FBN1</italic> gene alone (74.8%, 110/127). In 17 sporadic cases or families, no mutations were detected in the <italic toggle=""yes"">FBN1</italic> gene (13.4%), but mutations in the other seven Marfan‐related genes were discovered, four of which were classified as pathogenic or likely pathogenic mutations of the <italic toggle=""yes"">LTBP2</italic> gene. Collectively, the findings of this study suggest that the inclusion of additional Marfan‐related genes in the testing panel can increase the detection rate of MFS, variants in <italic toggle=""yes"">LTBP2</italic> may have a potential contributory role in the phenotypic spectrum of MFS, particularly in its ocular manifestations. Future animal experiments will be necessary to validate these assumptions. It should be noted, however, that 9 sporadic cases and 11 families still remain undiagnosed despite our genetic testing panel. One reason for this is that some individuals with MFS may have large deletion or insertion mutations that are not identified through current genetic testing methods. Additionally, there could be other genes related to MFS that have not yet been discovered. As such, further research is necessary to gain a more comprehensive understanding of the genetic mechanisms and pathogenicity of MFS. The most common form of pathogenic or likely pathogenic mutation is a missense mutation, specifically the <italic toggle=""yes"">FBN1</italic> c.4096G>A mutation, which has been identified in three sporadic cases or families. Among 181 mutations identified, 155 of them (85.6%) have been found in at least one sporadic case or family. The other 26 mutations (14.4%, 26/181) have been observed in the normal family members of probands and may not be pathogenic mutations of MFS. ACMG has predicted two of these mutations (KCNQ1 c.520C>T COL3A1 c.1427A>G) as likely pathogenic, but their pathogenicity requires confirmation with additional samples. In addition, 96 mutations (51.9%) have been uncovered, and 26 of these (27.1%) have been forecasted to be pathogenic or likely pathogenic mutations. Genetic methods and bioinformatics tools were used to confirm these detected mutations. The overall mutation detection rate for families (87.5%) was higher than that for sporadic cases (84.8%), which aligns with previous research suggesting a genetic predisposition to MFS (Verstraeten et al., <xref rid=""mgg32482-bib-0028"" ref-type=""bibr"">2016</xref>). In sporadic cases, 66 mutations were identified, including 15 pathogenic or likely pathogenic mutations (22.7%). Of these, 10 (66.7%) were found to be novel mutations. The results of pathogenicity prediction analyses indicate that these mutations are highly pathogenic. In family cases, 128 mutations are identified, including 38 pathogenic or likely pathogenic mutations (29.7%), 16 (42.1%) of which are novel mutations. Almost all cases (with the exception of <italic toggle=""yes"">LTBP2</italic> c.4617_4618delTG) are heterozygotes, indicating that a majority of individuals affected by MFS with ocular manifestations exhibit autosomal dominant inheritance, which corroborates previous studies (Mc, <xref rid=""mgg32482-bib-0015"" ref-type=""bibr"">1955</xref>). Besides, 13 de novo mutations are identified in 14 families (21.9%), which is not significantly different from research indicating that approximately 25% of MFS cases are caused by de novo mutations (Verstraeten et al., <xref rid=""mgg32482-bib-0028"" ref-type=""bibr"">2016</xref>). Almost all of these mutations are located in <italic toggle=""yes"">FBN1</italic> gene. These findings suggest that the <italic toggle=""yes"">FBN1</italic> gene may be more susceptible to de novo mutations in MFS, and the underlying mechanism warrants further investigation. Herein, our study identified a total of 181 mutations in 127 probands, resulting in an overall mutation detection rate of 86.4%. Of these mutations, 94 were novel, including 26 pathogenic or likely pathogenic mutations. Notably, four pathogenic or likely pathogenic mutations were identified in cases without mutations in the <italic toggle=""yes"">FBN1</italic> gene. The most commonly observed pathogenic or likely pathogenic mutation in our study was a missense mutation (<italic toggle=""yes"">FBN1</italic> c.4096G>A). Additionally, 14 MFS families with ocular manifestations were found to exhibit 13 de novo heterozygous mutations. Collectively, our study expands the range of mutations observed in the <italic toggle=""yes"">FBN1</italic> gene and provides additional evidence supporting the pathogenicity of the <italic toggle=""yes"">LTBP2</italic> gene in individuals with MFS and ocular manifestations. Despite the mutations identified in our study, not all patients can be explained by these findings. It is possible that large deletions or insertions in <italic toggle=""yes"">FBN1</italic>, as well as mutations in other known Marfan‐related genes, may account for some cases. Moreover, there may be additional genes involved in the development of MFS that have yet to be fully explored. Therefore, our study highlights the importance of further investigation into the genetics, mechanisms, and pathogenicity of <italic toggle=""yes"">FBN1</italic> and other Marfan‐related genes.

Complicated type B aortic dissection in a pregnant woman with Marfan syndrome,"Marfan syndrome is a rare inherited connective tissue disorder that can result in significant morbidity and mortality. We report a case of a 29-year-old pregnant woman presenting with an acute type B aortic dissection. Owing to cardiopulmonary decompensation and intestinal malperfusion, she underwent an emergency cesarean section followed by left subclavian to carotid transposition and thoracic endovascular aortic repair that was complicated by a retrograde type A aortic dissection and was managed surgically. Molecular testing confirmed the diagnosis of Marfan syndrome. This case highlights that multidisciplinary and hybrid management of challenging cases of acute aortic syndromes can result in a favorable outcome.","A previously healthy, 29-year-old gravida 2 para 1 woman presented in our department during her 30th week of gestation with the sudden onset of chest pain radiating to the back. She had delivered uneventfully 2 years earlier. On initial presentation, her blood pressure was 150/73 mm Hg. On physical examination, she had the classic clinical manifestations of MFS, including tall limbs, thin appearance, malar hypoplasia, arachnodactyly, joint hypermobility, and ectopia lentis. However, she had no family history of aortic dissection or connective tissue disease. She underwent a low-dose computed tomography angiogram (CTA) that showed a bovine aortic arch and acute TBAD (B<sub>3,10</sub>) with an entry tear located in zone 3 and extending down to both iliac arteries (<xref rid=""fig1"" ref-type=""fig"">Fig 1</xref>, <italic toggle=""yes"">A</italic> and <italic toggle=""yes"">B</italic>) with no evidence of aortic root dilatation, intramural hematoma, or aortopathy. Her laboratory markers were unremarkable. She was admitted to the intensive care unit for medical therapy, including antihypertensive treatment (labetalol, urapidil, and nicardipine). She was hemodynamically stable. On the third day, she developed an episode of severe hypertension unresponsive to antihypertensive treatments and respiratory decompensation requiring oxygen therapy up to 6 L/min using an O<sub>2</sub> face mask. A diagnosis of a cardiogenic pulmonary edema of undetermined etiology was made with left ventricular systolic function at 50% and left ventricular dilation, no dilation of the right cavities, and an unchanged electrocardiogram with no evidence for coronary artery disease. A multidisciplinary discussion involving vascular surgeons, obstetricians, neonatologists, and anesthesiologists resulted in the decision to undertake an emergency cesarean delivery, which was both successful and uneventful. After the delivery, her blood pressure was well-controlled under the same antihypertensive agents. Eight days later, she developed severe abdominal pain and intestinal malperfusion diagnosed through a CTA. She was taken to the operating room for left subclavian to carotid transposition and thoracic endovascular aortic repair (TEVAR) by using a 26-mm (oversizing 10% based on the CTA images with central line analysis) TAG conformable thoracic stent graft (W. L. Gore & Associates, Flagstaff, AZ) landing in zone 1 (nondissected zone) of the aortic arch. The procedure was carried out uneventfully.<fig id=""fig1""><label>Fig 1</label><caption><p><bold>(A)</bold> Sagittal view from preoperative computed tomography angiography (CTA) showing the fetus (red arrow) and type B aortic dissection (TBAD) with an entry tear (white arrow) located in zone 3 and involving the visceral arteries (bleu arrow). <bold>(B)</bold> Sagittal view with central line demonstrates a bovine aortic arch and TBAD with no evidence of aortic root dilatation, intramural hematoma or aortopathy.</p></caption><graphic http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink href=""gr1""></graphic></fig> Three days after her aortic procedure, she developed a sudden onset of chest pain. The CTA showed a retrograde aortic dissection, which was treated by ascending aortic replacement with a branched Dacron graft (26 mm) and reimplantation of the innominate artery under cardiopulmonary bypass, partial hypothermic circulatory arrest at 28°C, and perfusing in an anterograde fashion into the left carotid and right subclavian arteries. The postoperative course was uneventful, and she was discharged home after 14 days. Mother and infant continue to do well. She was then on three antihypertensive medications and aspirin therapy. Histologic and genetic analyses confirmed the assumption of MFS with a heterozygote de novo mutation of the FBN1 gene caused by a frameshift mutation. After 6 months of follow-up, a CTA (<xref rid=""fig2"" ref-type=""fig"">Fig 2</xref>) revealed the patency of the aortic graft and the stability of the distal aortic dissection.<fig id=""fig2""><label>Fig 2</label><caption><p>Three-dimensional computed tomography angiogram (CTA) at 6 months of follow-up demonstrating the aortic reconstruction showing the left subclavian to carotid transposition and ascending aortic replacement with reimplantation of the innominate artery by a bypass graft.</p></caption><graphic http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink href=""gr2""></graphic></fig> According to a US population-based health care database, the incidence of AD during pregnancy and the puerperium has increased from 2002 to 2017 and has been reflected directly by the increase in the incidence of TBAD during pregnancy and the puerperium. More than one-half (58.8%) of these patients presented with AD during the third trimester.<xref rid=""bib3"" ref-type=""bibr""><sup>3</sup></xref> This study found that as many as 21.9% of pregnancy-related ADs were in patients with MFS, and that MFS was associated with an extremely high risk of developing AD during pregnancy and the puerperium. According to international guidelines, stable patients with uncomplicated TBAD should receive optimal medical treatment.<xref rid=""bib9"" ref-type=""bibr""><sup>9</sup></xref> However, the medical management of uncomplicated TBAD still confers a 30-day mortality rate of 10% and a decreased long-term survival rate. Interest remains in determining whether early endovascular intervention might decrease the risk of downstream complications or negative aortic remodeling, particularly in high-risk patients such as the present one. Ma et al<xref rid=""bib4"" ref-type=""bibr""><sup>4</sup></xref> reported their experience in treating female patients with MFS during pregnancy with TBAD. They recommended that medical therapy for uncomplicated TBAD and complicated TBAD should be managed urgently with a delivery-first strategy, followed by aortic repair.<xref rid=""bib4"" ref-type=""bibr""><sup>4</sup></xref> Saving the fetus is always a worthwhile and often attainable goal. However, aortic repair should be prioritized over delivery for patients with visceral ischemia and signs of contained or impending aortic rupture. In this work, the authors noted that the early fetal survival before 28 gestational weeks was significantly lower compared with that after 28 gestational weeks (<italic toggle=""yes"">P</italic> < .001).<xref rid=""bib4"" ref-type=""bibr""><sup>4</sup></xref> TEVAR for complicated TBAD has become the first-line treatment owing to its lower morbidity and mortality than conventional open surgical repair.<xref rid=""bib10"" ref-type=""bibr"">10</xref>, <xref rid=""bib11"" ref-type=""bibr"">11</xref>, <xref rid=""bib12"" ref-type=""bibr"">12</xref> The primary goal of TEVAR is true lumen expansion, reducing the pressure inside the false lumen and thrombosis by covering the intimal tear (entry) of the aorta.<xref rid=""bib13"" ref-type=""bibr""><sup>13</sup></xref> However, as illustrated here, in a situation wherein the aortic vessel wall is particularly fragile, TEVAR can trigger a RTAD, a potentially fatal complication, whose incidence ranges from 1.3% to 17.9% and mortality from 33.4% to 42.0%.<xref rid=""bib14"" ref-type=""bibr""><sup>14</sup></xref> In the presented case, the intimal tear presented in zone 3 of the aortic arch and, given the presence of a bovine aortic arch, the decision was made to land the stent graft as proximal as possible in a healthy nondissected aorta just after the innominate artery. Therefore, in our opinion, this strategy increased the risk of RTAD in this case. The operative strategies for the rescue of these patients from this complication are similar to those for acute type A dissection. Thus, treating these challenging cases in tertiary care centers is critical. Another controversial aspect of this case is the effect of radiation exposure during pregnancy. The fetus is most susceptible to radiation during organogenesis (2-7 weeks of gestation) and in the first trimester, and more resistant during the second and third trimesters.<xref rid=""bib15"" ref-type=""bibr""><sup>15</sup></xref> It is usually considered that the maternal benefit of an early and accurate diagnosis may outweigh the fetal risk of radiation exposure. Coordination with a radiologist is helpful in modifying the CT protocol to decrease the total radiation dose and the use of unnecessary multiphasic protocols. Here, after initial CTA and before child delivery after 48 hours of intensive care unit admission, angio-magnetic resonance imaging was performed at 48 hours to decrease the overall irradiation. This case highlights the potential morbidity of treating an aortic dissection in pregnant women with MFS. It is critical to identify improved methods to prevent pregnancy-related AD in patients with MFS. The existing literature suggests that women with high-risk pregnancies, such as those with MFS, should be closely monitored by a multidisciplinary team owing to the increased risk of aortic related complications especially in the third trimester, when the risk is highest.<xref rid=""bib4"" ref-type=""bibr""><sup>4</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid=""bib7"" ref-type=""bibr""><sup>7</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid=""bib8"" ref-type=""bibr""><sup>8</sup></xref> Follow-up of such patients should be realized in close vicinity of tertiary centers if possible.

Cerebral Microvascular Density, Permeability of the Blood-Brain Barrier, and Neuroinflammatory Responses Indicate Early Aging Characteristics in a Marfan Syndrome Mouse Model
","
Marfan Syndrome (MFS) is a connective tissue disorder due to mutations in fibrillin-1 (
<italic toggle=""yes"">Fbn1</italic>
), where a
<italic toggle=""yes"">Fbn1</italic>
missense mutation (
<italic toggle=""yes"">
Fbn1
<sup>C1039G/+</sup>
</italic>
) can result in systemic increases in the bioavailability and signaling of transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β). In a well-established mouse model of MFS (
<italic toggle=""yes"">
Fbn1
<sup>C1041G/+</sup>
</italic>
), pre-mature aging of the aortic wall and the progression of aortic root aneurysm are observed by 6-months-of-age. TGF-β signaling has been implicated in cerebrovascular dysfunction, loss of blood-brain barrier (BBB) integrity, and age-related neuroinflammation. We have reported that pre-mature vascular aging in MFS mice could extend to cerebrovasculature, where peak blood flow velocity in the posterior cerebral artery (PCA) of 6-month-old (6M) MFS mice was reduced, similarly to 12-month-old (12M) control mice. Case studies of MFS patients have documented neurovascular manifestations, including intracranial aneurysms, stroke, arterial tortuosity, as well as headaches and migraines, with reported incidence of pain and chronic fatigue. Despite these significant clinical observations, investigation into cerebrovascular dysfunction and neuropathology in MFS remains limited. Using 6M-control (
<italic toggle=""yes"">C57BL/6</italic>
) and 6M-MFS (
<italic toggle=""yes"">
Fbn1
<sup>C1041G/+</sup>
</italic>
) and healthy 12M-control male and female mice, we test the hypothesis that abnormal Fbn1 protein expression is associated with altered cerebral microvascular density, BBB permeability, and neuroinflammation in the PCA-perfused hippocampus, all indicative of a pre-mature aging brain phenotype.
 Using Glut1 staining, 6M-MFS mice and 12M-CTRL similarly present decreased microvascular density in the dentate gyrus (DG), cornu ammonis 1 (CA1), and cornu ammonis 3 (CA3) regions of the hippocampus. 6M-MFS mice exhibit increased BBB permeability in the DG, CA1, and CA3 as evident by Immunoglobulin G (IgG) staining, which was more comparable to 12M-CTRL mice. 6M-MFS mice show a higher number of microglia in the hippocampus compared to age-matched control mice, a pattern resembling that of 12M-CTRL mice. This study represents the first known investigation into neuropathology in a mouse model of MFS and indicates that the pathophysiology underlying MFS leads to a systemic pre-mature aging phenotype. This study is crucial for identifying and understanding MFS-associated neurovascular and neurological abnormalities, underscoring the need for research aimed at improving the quality of life and managing pre-mature aging symptoms in MFS and related connective tissue disorders.",Full text not available in PMC,N/A,02 7 2024

For the purpose of this study, a diverse dataset of facial images was assembled from several public sources: For non-Marfan faces, faces were excerpted from a public database of human faces provided by Flickr. For Marfan faces, faces were excerpted from pictures and videos relating to Marfan Syndrome primarily from the following sources: the Marfan Foundation (<ext-link ext-link-type=""uri"" http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink href=""https://marfan.org/"" id=""intref0025"">https://marfan.org/</ext-link>), the Marfan Trust (<ext-link ext-link-type=""uri"" http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink href=""https://www.marfantrust.org"" id=""intref0030"">https://www.marfantrust.org</ext-link>), You Tube, Standalone articles. In our data assembly process, we included any organization that dealt with Marfan Syndrome, including the Marfan Foundation, the Marfan Trust, and similar organizations. We methodically worked through all their sites' subpages for images identifying someone with MFS. Screenshots of the relevant faces on those pages and articles were taken. We searched for “Marfan syndrome” and “Marfan syndrome faces” on Google and interrogated all the results, which likely contained images of people with MFS. We acquired screenshots where the context article clarified that the people in question had MFS. Finally, we searched for videos on YouTube related to MFS, including medical videos discussing MFS and “living with MFS""-type videos and screen-snipped people's faces where the context made it clear that they had MFS. As for racial/ethnic breakdown, the dataset consisted of 83 % Caucasian/Hispanic subjects, 10 % black subjects, and 7 % Asian subjects. Non-Marfan images: The Flickr-Faces-HQ public database of human faces was utilized to obtain images of individuals not diagnosed with Marfan Syndrome. Given the low incidence rate of Marfan Syndrome, any mislabeled images within the Flickr database were considered to have a negligible impact on the study. The total number of non-Marfan patient images used was 490, notwithstanding that several hundred thousand sample images are available from this dataset. Inclusion and exclusion criteria: The inclusion criteria for the study were facial images of individuals either diagnosed with Marfan Syndrome (as described above) or those assumed not to have the syndrome (Flickr database). Images were required to clearly show the front of the face, to be free from obscuring facial coverings (although images where the subject was wearing glasses or goggles were not removed), and to be of adequate quality and resolution. Images were excluded if they failed to meet these criteria. No age limits were imposed, and the datasets include images of juveniles. The images were preprocessed, normalized to a uniform size, and augmented (reconfigured) to increase the dataset's size and diversity. The images were preprocessed using the TensorFlow library within a Python environment. This preprocessing included rescaling the pixel-intensity values to a value between 0 and 1, and resizing each image so that they would all have a uniform height of 450 pixels and uniform width of 250 pixels. Their backgrounds were also removed (converted to blank pixels) to ensure the model was learning from the facial features only and not from anything in the background. The images were also augmented (reconfigured) to increase the dataset's size and diversity. This is done by applying various transformations to the original images, creating multiple different versions of each image. In particular, the following augmentation techniques were applied.<list list-type=""simple"" id=""olist0010""><list-item id=""o0010""><label>1)</label><p id=""p0110"">rotation – images are rotated by a random angle</p></list-item><list-item id=""o0015""><label>2)</label><p id=""p0115"">zooming – randomly zooming into or out of an image</p></list-item><list-item id=""o0020""><label>3)</label><p id=""p0120"">brightness, contrast and saturation adjustment – randomly changing the brightness, contrast and saturation of an image</p></list-item><list-item id=""o0025""><label>4)</label><p id=""p0125"">noise addition – adding random noise to the image.</p></list-item></list> The following paragraphs describe the pattern-recognition methods used in this work. In this study, a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), a prominent architecture in deep learning, was used to identify and recognize the facial features relevant to the diagnosis Marfan Syndrome from facial images. CNNs diverge from traditional image analysis methods in their approach to processing and learning from image data. CNN's were chosen for this task because of their ability to recognize and learn useful features within images without requiring explicit guidance. This autonomous feature extraction capability significantly reduces the need for manual feature engineering, making CNNs highly efficient and effective in various applications, including medical image analysis [<xref rid=""bib12"" ref-type=""bibr"">12</xref>]. Moreover, CNNs are designed to be invariant to translations and rotations of the input image, meaning they can recognize features regardless of their position or orientation within the image. This is achieved through the use of convolutional and pooling layers, which allow the network to detect local patterns and spatial hierarchies. As a result, once a CNN learns a specific facial feature indicative of Marfan Syndrome, it can identify this feature in new images, even if the feature appears in different locations or orientations [<xref rid=""bib13"" ref-type=""bibr"">13</xref>]. Additionally, it is important to note that the features identified by CNNs may differ from those used by humans. CNNs often focus on local patterns and textures, which might not be the primary focus of human visual analysis. This difference highlights the unique way in which CNNs learn and apply heuristics, often leading to improved performance on specific tasks by leveraging different aspects of the visual data compared to human observers [<xref rid=""bib12"" ref-type=""bibr"">12</xref>]. In the context of our study, these high-level features could correspond to combinations of multiple facial characteristics distinctive of Marfan Syndrome, aligning with prior studies that underscore the value of assessing a combination of facial traits. The CNN model was trained on the preprocessed images, with each image labeled as ‘Marfan’ or ‘Non-Marfan’. The images were fed into the network, which then learned to identify and abstract relevant facial features associated with Marfan Syndrome, ultimately enabling it to classify unseen images effectively as “Marfan” or “non-Marfan”. To assess the model's performance, a variety of metrics were calculated. The model was trained using a random sample of 80 % of the images in the dataset (“the training dataset”). The remaining 20 % were held back to be used as unseen data on which to assess the model performance (“the validation dataset”). The statistical analysis for this study was performed using Python with the Pandas and scikit-learn libraries. The following metrics were calculated to evaluate the performance of our model in classifying Marfan and Non-Marfan cases.<list list-type=""simple"" id=""olist0015""><list-item id=""o0030""><label>1.</label><p id=""p0165"">Overall Accuracy: This metric is calculated as the ratio of correctly predicted instances (both true positives and true negatives) to the total instances.</p></list-item><list-item id=""o0035""><label>2.</label><p id=""p0170"">Precision: Precision was calculated separately for Marfan and Non-Marfan classes.</p></list-item><list-item id=""o0040""><label>3.</label><p id=""p0175"">Sensitivity (Recall): Sensitivity was calculated to gauge correct identification of Marfan and non-Marfan cases.</p></list-item><list-item id=""o0045""><label>4.</label><p id=""p0180"">F1 Score: The F1 score is the harmonic mean of precision and recall.

These include physical diagnosis, echocardiography, computerized tomography (CT), and genetic testing (in this era, usually via Whole Exome Sequencing (WES)). These components each play a vital role. Nonetheless, especially before WES or when WES is not available, uncertainty in precise diagnosis may prevail – a gap that the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model may help to fill, as an adjunct to traditional diagnostic methods. Also, this Artificial Intelligence technique may conceivably provide assistance in resolving the frequent conundrum represented by the frequent WES reports that a “Variant of Unknown. Significance (VUS) has been identified. A positive facial recognition test may suggest more likely veracity of the VUS. The present study underscores the substantial potential of AI, specifically CNNs, to provide alternative supplementary approaches to the diagnosis for genetic disorders like Marfan Syndrome. This experience has shown that CNNs can offer an extremely accurate assessment. These results were achieved instantly and non-invasively upon application of the CNN program. The non-invasive nature of the CNN model and the speed and ease with which the testing can be performed can be expected to hold significant clinical value. While the CNN model demonstrated impressive performance, it is crucial to address its limitations. The model's performance is contingent on the availability and quality of the input images, implying that varied lighting conditions and image quality could adversely affect diagnostic accuracy. Moreover, the model's reliance on observable facial features means that its utility may be limited in cases where the syndrome's facial manifestations are subtle or not yet fully apparent. With respect to the collection of facial images for Marfan subjects, images were included only if it was clear from the context in which the image was found that the subject has been diagnosed with Marfan Syndrome. However, it is frequently not clear how the diagnosis was made. This is an area where extensions of this research may be improved. It should also be noted that the images from which the Marfan subjects’ faces were excerpted were not originally intended for clinical application. Consequently, they include certain images with unusual orientation and facial expressions. However, the facial images for the non-Marfan group were also not collected for clinical application, and so exhibit similar shortcomings. As such, it is not expected that this should impact the reliability of the assessment of the model performance. Additionally, it remains to be seen how well the model's performance would generalize across various racial groups. Although no racial groups were excluded from the dataset used for training and testing the model considered in this paper, the vast majority of images obtained for Marfan subjects were Caucasian. Although the non-Marfan subjects were more racially diverse, that dataset obtained was also majority Caucasian. In order to ensure that the model could be used reliably on all racial groups, it would be necessary to supplement the dataset with subjects from non-Caucasian racial groups. In terms of overall perspective, due to lack of external/clinical validation and lack of patient characteristics, this manuscript should be considered as a preliminary pilot study whose utility in real-world application remains to be demonstrated. Despite these limitations, the CNN model's benefits, including its high accuracy, speed, and cost-effectiveness, make it a promising tool for augmenting traditional diagnostic protocols for Marfan Syndrome. Future studies should focus on refining the model to handle varied image conditions and on exploring methods to identify subtle facial manifestations more effectively. At present, it has not been established which particular facial features are utilized by the CNN to make its determination of whether a particular subject has Marfan Syndrome. <italic toggle=""yes"">Future Directions</italic>: While the results from this study are promising, further work is needed to fully realize the potential of CNNs in clinical practice. Future research should consider the real-world implementation of this CNN model, including the development of user-friendly interfaces for clinicians. Rigorous validation of the model on larger, more diverse datasets (in the dimensions of race and age, in particular) is also essential. Ethical considerations such as patient consent, data security, and privacy should be addressed before integrating this approach into routine healthcare practices. It would also be valuable to address the shortcomings of the current research presented in this paper, including.<list list-type=""simple"" id=""ulist0015""><list-item id=""u0030""><label>•</label><p id=""p0265""><italic toggle=""yes"">Improving the standardization of the images.</italic> It may be valuable to collect images for training CNN models that make use of standardized facial orientation (or orientations), distance from the camera, picture resolution and facial obstructions (i.e. removing spectacles or goggles).</p></list-item><list-item id=""u0035""><label>•</label><p id=""p0270""><italic toggle=""yes"">Ascertaining confirmed diagnosis of Marfan Syndrome.</italic> As mentioned above, the subjects included in the Marfan group were self-reported as having been diagnosed with Marfan Syndrome.

The analysis conducted shows that the CNN model can rival traditional diagnostic methods in terms of accuracy, while also offering advantages in speed and non-invasiveness. However, due to the limited and preliminary nature of this work, this should be viewed as only a pilot study. As AI continues to revolutionize healthcare, integrating such AI-based models into the diagnostic workflow could substantially enhance early detection and management of conditions like Marfan Syndrome. It may be possible to deploy such models to allow for screening in non-specialist settings, such as with general practitioners, nurses, schools and workplaces.
