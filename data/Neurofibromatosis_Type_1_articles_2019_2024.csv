Stimulator of interferon gene facilitates recruitment of effector CD8 T cells that drive neurofibromatosis type 1 nerve tumor initiation and maintenance,"Plexiform neurofibromas (PNFs) are benign nerve tumors driven by loss of the <italic toggle=""yes"">NF1</italic> tumor suppressor in Schwann cells. PNFs are rich in immune cells, but whether immune cells are necessary for tumorigenesis is unknown. We show that inhibition of stimulator of interferon gene (STING) reduces plasma CXCL10, tumor T cell and dendritic cell (DC) recruitment, and tumor formation. Further, mice lacking XCR-1<sup>+</sup> DCs showed reduced tumor-infiltrating T cells and PNF tumors. Antigen-presenting cells from tumor-bearing mice promoted CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell proliferation in vitro, and PNF T cells expressed high levels of CCL5, implicating T cell activation. Notably, tumors and nerve-associated macrophages were absent in Rag1<sup>−/−</sup>; Nf1<sup>f/f</sup>; DhhCre mice and adoptive transfer of CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells from tumor-bearing mice restored PNF initiation. In this setting, PNF shrunk upon subsequent T cell removal. Thus, STING pathway activation contributes to CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell–dependent inflammatory responses required for PNF initiation and maintenance. Infiltrating T cells drive NF1 nerve tumor development.","Inflammation is a hallmark of tumorigenesis (<xref rid=""R1"" ref-type=""bibr""><italic toggle=""yes"">1</italic></xref>) and a notable feature of the plexiform neurofibromas (PNFs). PNFs are peripheral nerve tumors that develop in 30 to 50% of individuals with neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) and can cause substantial morbidity (<xref rid=""R2"" ref-type=""bibr""><italic toggle=""yes"">2</italic></xref>). In mouse models, PNFs form months after loss of <italic toggle=""yes"">Nf1</italic> in nerve Schwann cells (SCs). Over time, macrophages, mast cells, and, subsequently, small numbers of T cells and dendritic cells (DCs) are recruited to the paraspinal ganglia and nerves, after which PNFs develop (<xref rid=""R3"" ref-type=""bibr""><italic toggle=""yes"">3</italic></xref>–<xref rid=""R5"" ref-type=""bibr""><italic toggle=""yes"">5</italic></xref>). Each of these immune cell types also accumulates in human PNF, providing a microenvironment that fosters benign tumor growth (<xref rid=""R5"" ref-type=""bibr""><italic toggle=""yes"">5</italic></xref>–<xref rid=""R7"" ref-type=""bibr""><italic toggle=""yes"">7</italic></xref>). SCs are the only cells within neurofibromas that contain biallelic pathogenic variants in the <italic toggle=""yes"">NF1</italic> tumor suppressor gene, which encodes a RAS–guanosine 5′-triphosphate (GAP), so that SCs have elevated levels of RAS-GTP (<xref rid=""R8"" ref-type=""bibr""><italic toggle=""yes"">8</italic></xref>). PNFs serve as a model of inflammation-driven tumors because immune cell infiltration and tumor formation are separable in time. In the 1960s, mast cells were identified in neurofibromas and suggested to be important for tumor development [reviewed in (<xref rid=""R9"" ref-type=""bibr""><italic toggle=""yes"">9</italic></xref>, <xref rid=""R10"" ref-type=""bibr""><italic toggle=""yes"">10</italic></xref>)]. Unexpectedly, however, mast cells were found to be dispensable for neurofibroma formation in murine models (<xref rid=""R11"" ref-type=""bibr""><italic toggle=""yes"">11</italic></xref>). It is now known that myeloid cells, largely, macrophages, are the dominant immune cells in neurofibromas (<xref rid=""R12"" ref-type=""bibr""><italic toggle=""yes"">12</italic></xref>); DCs and T cells are also present (<xref rid=""R5"" ref-type=""bibr""><italic toggle=""yes"">5</italic></xref>–<xref rid=""R7"" ref-type=""bibr""><italic toggle=""yes"">7</italic></xref>). A requirement for immune cells in PNF formation was underscored by the finding that, when <italic toggle=""yes"">Nf1</italic> was lost in populations of SCs (Krox20-Cre;Nf1<sup>f/f</sup>), tumors formed after engrafting Nf1<sup>+/−</sup> hematopoietic cells (<xref rid=""R13"" ref-type=""bibr""><italic toggle=""yes"">13</italic></xref>). In addition, when <italic toggle=""yes"">Nf1</italic> was lost in populations of SCs (P0-Cre;Nf1<sup>f/f</sup>), tumors formed after wound-related influx of wild-type (WT) or Nf1<sup>+/−</sup> immune cells (<xref rid=""R14"" ref-type=""bibr""><italic toggle=""yes"">14</italic></xref>). In the Nf1<sup>f/f</sup>; DhhCre model, all immune cells are WT at the Nf1 locus, and PNFs form in all mice. In this model, DC and T cells express the chemokine receptor CXCR3, and deletion of CXCR3 prevented PNF formation (<xref rid=""R15"" ref-type=""bibr""><italic toggle=""yes"">15</italic></xref>). Together, these gain- and loss-of-function studies strongly support the idea that mutant SCs require immune cells, likely DCs and/or T cells, for PNF initiation and growth. Whether T cells and/or DCs contribute to neurofibroma development has not been studied. Given the importance of CXCR3 in PNF initiation, it is of interest that CXCR3-expressing cells migrate toward the CXCR3 ligands CXCL9 and/or CXCL10 and that CXCL10 is expressed by <italic toggle=""yes"">Nf1<sup>−/−</sup></italic> SCs before tumor formation (<xref rid=""R3"" ref-type=""bibr""><italic toggle=""yes"">3</italic></xref>). The stimulator of interferon gene (STING) activation generally occurs when cells sense damage-related signals including double-stranded RNAs/DNAs, and STING activation promotes expression of cytokines including CXCL10 via induction of type I interferons (<xref rid=""R16"" ref-type=""bibr""><italic toggle=""yes"">16</italic></xref>, <xref rid=""R17"" ref-type=""bibr""><italic toggle=""yes"">17</italic></xref>). Neurofibroma cells show evidence of damage, with an increase in SCs containing DNA damage foci compared to that in SCs in normal nerves (<xref rid=""R18"" ref-type=""bibr""><italic toggle=""yes"">18</italic></xref>). Damage likely occurs, at least, in part, because loss of <italic toggle=""yes"">Nf1</italic> in SCs leads to elevated RAS-GTP, and acute elevation of RAS-GTP in cells can lead to cell damage, cell senescence, or cell death (<xref rid=""R16"" ref-type=""bibr""><italic toggle=""yes"">16</italic></xref>). We posited that, after SC-specific loss of <italic toggle=""yes"">NF1</italic>, STING activation increases cytokines and chemokines that modulate the tumor microenvironment via DC and/or T cell recruitment, resulting in tumorigenesis. T cells have been implicated in promoting tumor formation. For example, CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells induced proliferation of epithelial cells in benign prostatic hyperplasia (<xref rid=""R19"" ref-type=""bibr""><italic toggle=""yes"">19</italic></xref>). Conversely, T cell depletion delayed tumor formation in a mouse model of inflammation induced hepatocellular carcinoma (<xref rid=""R20"" ref-type=""bibr""><italic toggle=""yes"">20</italic></xref>). In addition, the absence of a subset of T cells (γδT cells) significantly decreased the incidence of chemically induced papilloma (<xref rid=""R21"" ref-type=""bibr""><italic toggle=""yes"">21</italic></xref>). Notably, reconstitution of tumor-prone mice with bone marrow lacking T cells (Rag2<sup>−/−</sup> or δTCR<sup>−/−</sup>) profoundly reduced tumor formation (<xref rid=""R22"" ref-type=""bibr""><italic toggle=""yes"">22</italic></xref>). How tumor cells recruit T cells and how T cells become activated in these models are poorly understood. Through their T cell receptors, CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells are primed by DCs presenting antigenic peptides in the context of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules. Although peptides presented by class I MHC molecules are generally derived from inside the cell, specialized conventional type I DC (cDC1) cells have the capability of presenting extracellular antigens on class I MHC, via a process known as cross-presentation (<xref rid=""R23"" ref-type=""bibr""><italic toggle=""yes"">23</italic></xref>). In the context of tumors, cDC1 cells, marked by expression of Xcr-1, are highly efficient in the uptake and presentation of tumor associated antigens on class I MHC to tumor-specific CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells (<xref rid=""R24"" ref-type=""bibr""><italic toggle=""yes"">24</italic></xref>). This “cross-priming” of T cells promotes their initial activation and enables their effector programs that normally facilitate tumor killing. We show that <italic toggle=""yes"">Nf1</italic> loss in SCs results in STING activation. STING activity contributes to production of CXCL10 and, therefore, to recruitment by SCs of CXCR3-expressing DC1, DC2, and T cells. Antigen-presenting cells (APCs) from tumor-bearing mice are sufficient to promote T cell proliferation and within tumors, T cells show evidence of activation. Last, we found that CD8 T cells are required for tumor formation and for tumor maintenance, demonstrating a previously unknown role for T cells in promoting tumorigenesis.  This study identifies the innate immune regulator STING as increased in <italic toggle=""yes"">NF1</italic> SCs. STING contributes to CXCL10 elevation and, thus, to T cell infiltration and T cell activation in PNF. In the Nf1<sup>f/f</sup>; DhhCre model of neurofibroma formation studied here, all immune cells are WT at the Nf1 locus. Therefore, <italic toggle=""yes"">Nf1</italic>-mutant SCs recruit WT immune cells that support PNF initiation and growth (<xref rid=""R32"" ref-type=""bibr""><italic toggle=""yes"">32</italic></xref>). Our series of genetic crosses revealed a contribution of WT cDC1 to tumor number and size and demonstrate that mice lacking T cells have no tumors. Thus, infiltrating T cells, a component of the adaptive immune system, are necessary for the development of benign NF1-associated PNF. Our data are consistent with prior work showing that inflammation contributes to neurofibroma development (<xref rid=""R3"" ref-type=""bibr""><italic toggle=""yes"">3</italic></xref>, <xref rid=""R11"" ref-type=""bibr""><italic toggle=""yes"">11</italic></xref>) and extends it by demonstrating that T cells are the critical immune cell type driving tumor formation. The data reveal a pathway in which loss of <italic toggle=""yes"">NF1</italic> in SCs leads to SC activation of STING, which itself promotes expression of STING inducible cytokines. One such cytokine, CXCL10, drives recruitment of DCs and T cells that ultimately drive neurofibroma development, likely through T cell recognition of antigen. In contrast to effects on tumors, the absence of adaptive immune cells failed to restore abnormal Remak bundle structure that is a characteristic of nerves and tumors containing SCs lacking <italic toggle=""yes"">NF1</italic> (<xref rid=""R33"" ref-type=""bibr""><italic toggle=""yes"">33</italic></xref>, <xref rid=""R34"" ref-type=""bibr""><italic toggle=""yes"">34</italic></xref>). Therefore, some effects of cell <italic toggle=""yes"">Nf1</italic> loss of function in vivo are independent of tumor-driving components of the adaptive immune system. Intriguingly, in contrast, the deletion of Cxcr3 in the Nf1<sup>f/f</sup>; DhhCre mice prevented tumor formation and rescued nerve ultrastructure (<xref rid=""R15"" ref-type=""bibr""><italic toggle=""yes"">15</italic></xref>). In addition, as STING inhibition or deletion only partially blocked neurofibroma initiation and growth, additional inputs must cooperate with STING activation after an initiating <italic toggle=""yes"">Nf1</italic> insult. We suggest that stressed <italic toggle=""yes"">Nf1<sup>−/−</sup></italic> SCs, via STING, increase expression of CXCL10, which recruits T cells and DCs, enabling PNF initiation, given that STING activation contributes to circulating CXCL10 protein levels, in which pharmacologic suppression of STING in established tumors reduces PNF number and size. Genetic deletion of STING also reduced tumor number and size. Consistent with our findings, in a model of inflammation-induced skin carcinogenesis, after DMBA application, STING became activated, preceding papilloma formation, and STING activation resulted in production of cytokines and inflammation (<xref rid=""R35"" ref-type=""bibr""><italic toggle=""yes"">35</italic></xref>). These results suggest the generalizability of a STING-tumor initiation pathway across tumor types and emphasize the potential utility of STING pathway antagonism at early stages in cell transformation. STING antagonism is also being tested to block cancer-related metastasis (<xref rid=""R25"" ref-type=""bibr""><italic toggle=""yes"">25</italic></xref>, <xref rid=""R36"" ref-type=""bibr""><italic toggle=""yes"">36</italic></xref>). In contrast, however, STING agonists are being tested clinically in efforts to activate immune cells, including effector T lymphocytes, for antitumor effects (<xref rid=""R37"" ref-type=""bibr""><italic toggle=""yes"">37</italic></xref>). In a murine model of malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor, a recent study showed that STING agonist potentiated the antitumor effects of anti-PD1 (<xref rid=""R38"" ref-type=""bibr""><italic toggle=""yes"">38</italic></xref>). How activating or inactivating the STING pathway affects specific stages of transformation to malignancy needs further study. Flow cytometry analysis identified a MHCII<sup>hi</sup>; CD11b<sup>−</sup>; CD11c<sup>+</sup>;Xcr-1<sup>+</sup> cDC1 population among PNF immune cells. cDC1s are key regulators of tumor antigen trafficking and CD8 T cell recruitment/activation (<xref rid=""R23"" ref-type=""bibr""><italic toggle=""yes"">23</italic></xref>, <xref rid=""R39"" ref-type=""bibr""><italic toggle=""yes"">39</italic></xref>–<xref rid=""R41"" ref-type=""bibr""><italic toggle=""yes"">41</italic></xref>). The deficiency of Batf3<sup>+</sup> cDC1 cells attenuated PNF formation and reduced tumor number. Batf3 deficiency also resulted in decreased TCRβ<sup>+</sup> CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells and T cell activation. This finding is consistent with a role for cDC1 cells in promoting CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell responses (<xref rid=""R42"" ref-type=""bibr""><italic toggle=""yes"">42</italic></xref>). Batf3 may also contribute to memory CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell survival, so future experiments will need to distinguish between roles of Batf3 in cDC1 versus T cells during PNF formation. In PNF, <italic toggle=""yes"">Batf3</italic>-dependent cDC1 might present antigens to cause activation of T cells in neurofibroma, as cDC1s are APCs that efficiently cross-present antigen to T cells, stimulating their proliferation. However, given that the deficiency of cDC1 cells did not completely prevent neurofibroma formation, additional APCs may also contribute to cross-presentation of antigen to T lymphocytes. cDC2 can also cross-prime T cells (<xref rid=""R43"" ref-type=""bibr""><italic toggle=""yes"">43</italic></xref>), so deletion of both cDC1 and cDC2 cells may be required to mimic the marked effects of T cell loss on PNF initiation and growth. Other DC or macrophage populations may also present antigen, albeit at lower levels than do cDC1. In addition, in peripheral nerve inflammation, neuropathic disorder, and after injury, SCs themselves are capable APCs and might augment and/or compensate for the loss of cDC1 cells (<xref rid=""R44"" ref-type=""bibr""><italic toggle=""yes"">44</italic></xref>–<xref rid=""R46"" ref-type=""bibr""><italic toggle=""yes"">46</italic></xref>). T cell activity is regulated by the complex interactions of T cells with DCs and other APCs. These interactions are mediated by both soluble cytokines and cell-cell complexes (<xref rid=""R47"" ref-type=""bibr""><italic toggle=""yes"">47</italic></xref>). Spleen cells from tumor-bearing mice promoted expansion of T cells in vitro, suggesting that antigens play roles in neurofibroma formation. In a murine model of Nf1-driven low-grade glioma, depletion of CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells attenuated tumor cell proliferation; the authors suggested that T cells produce cytokines that indirectly support tumor growth (<xref rid=""R48"" ref-type=""bibr""><italic toggle=""yes"">48</italic></xref>). It is plausible that antigens and DCs also play roles in these benign Nf1-driven nervous system tumors. The idea that antigens or antibodies are involved in tumor formation was suggested by seminal studies of (<xref rid=""R49"" ref-type=""bibr""><italic toggle=""yes"">49</italic></xref>). In that study, however, transfer of B cells or serum from tumor-bearing mice, not transfer of T cells, enabled chronic inflammation and tumor cell proliferation in a model of HPV16-driven skin carcinogenesis. Thus, diverse tumor types may use divergent mechanisms to sustain immune cell activation for tumor initiation. We presented four lines of evidence supporting antigen priming of PNF T cells. First, culture of T cells from Nf1<sup>f/f</sup>; DhhCre mice showed evidence of proliferation in response to APC, a marker of primed T cells responding to antigen. Second, within PNF, CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells expressed high levels of CD44, an activation/memory marker, as well as CD69, another acute activation marker. Third, PNF tumor-resident CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells expressed CCL5 protein. This is suggestive of recent TCR stimulation as quiescent memory T cells express high levels of CCL5 mRNA, but not protein, unless given a TCR stimulus (<xref rid=""R31"" ref-type=""bibr""><italic toggle=""yes"">31</italic></xref>). Fourth, after adoptive transfer of CD4 and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells into Rag1<sup>−/−</sup> mice, CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells expanded and became preferentially enriched over their CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell counterparts. Combined, these data strongly support the scenario whereby CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells primed during development of NF1 tumors undergo activation, clonal expansion, and acquisition of effector function in a manner that promotes tumor development. Expression of CCL5 by PNF T cells is also consistent with literature, suggesting that STING modulates inflammation via altering cytokine/chemokine production, contributing to tumor development (<xref rid=""R50"" ref-type=""bibr""><italic toggle=""yes"">50</italic></xref>, <xref rid=""R51"" ref-type=""bibr""><italic toggle=""yes"">51</italic></xref>). When CCL5-expressing T cells are absent in Rag1<sup>−/−</sup>; Nf1<sup>f/f</sup>; DhhCre mice, we observed a profound decrease in nerve macrophages and the resolution of nerve inflammation. PNF CCL5 (RANTES) may contribute to the T cell–driven maintenance of macrophages in PNF through known RANTES effects on cell migration and matrix remodeling and/or altering immune cell phenotypes such as polarizing macrophages toward immunosuppressive phenotypes (<xref rid=""R52"" ref-type=""bibr""><italic toggle=""yes"">52</italic></xref>). CCL5 is also present in an Nf1 low-grade glioma model, albeit produced by microglia, and depletion of CD3<sup>+</sup> or CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells using blocking antibodies attenuated tumor cell proliferation in that system, suggesting relevance of CCL5 and T cells to other NF1-mutant tumors (<xref rid=""R48"" ref-type=""bibr""><italic toggle=""yes"">48</italic></xref>). The CCL5/CCR5 axis may be targetable as numerous clinical trials of antagonists are ongoing (<xref rid=""R53"" ref-type=""bibr""><italic toggle=""yes"">53</italic></xref>). This is important as suppressing all T cell functions is not advisable, and selective modulation of T cell function aimed at slowing or ablating tumor formation might be tolerable in the setting of predisposition to neurofibroma. The absence of T cells abrogates PNF formation, and the adoptive transfer of CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells from tumor-bearing mice elicits PNF formation. These findings are consistent with pro-tumorigenic functions of CD8 T cells described in some models of low-grade or premalignant tumor types (<xref rid=""R19"" ref-type=""bibr""><italic toggle=""yes"">19</italic></xref>–<xref rid=""R21"" ref-type=""bibr""><italic toggle=""yes"">21</italic></xref>, <xref rid=""R48"" ref-type=""bibr""><italic toggle=""yes"">48</italic></xref>, <xref rid=""R54"" ref-type=""bibr""><italic toggle=""yes"">54</italic></xref>). Notably, however, pro-tumorigenic roles of CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells have been described in other tumorigenesis models (<xref rid=""R55"" ref-type=""bibr""><italic toggle=""yes"">55</italic></xref>–<xref rid=""R58"" ref-type=""bibr""><italic toggle=""yes"">58</italic></xref>). In neurofibromas, it remains necessary to formally exclude roles of CD4 T cells in tumorigenesis, given that transplantation of >98% pure CD4 T cells into Rag1<sup>−/−</sup>; Nf1<sup>f/f</sup>; DhhCre mice resulted in expansion of a residual CD8<sup>+</sup> cell population. However, given that CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells alone promoted neurofibroma formation, we conclude that CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells are sufficient to promote the transition from nerve inflammation to PNF formation. In other models of tumor initiation, it will be of interest to study the early roles of STING and antigen and the effects on tumor myeloid cells. In conclusion, T cells play a critical role in promoting the formation of NF1-associated PNFs and for driving the expansion of an inflammatory environment. Identification of molecules involved in T cell activation and trafficking and whether T cell activation is dependent on specific antigens or cytokines warrant further study. Intercepting the pro-inflammatory cooperation of immune cells, including APC–T cell signals that contribute to the formation of tumors is anticipated to provide new therapeutic approaches toward management and/or prevention of NF1 tumors.

Proof of Concept for Genome Profiling of the Neurofibroma/Sarcoma Sequence in Neurofibromatosis Type 1,"Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) is an autosomal dominant genetic disorder characterized by the predisposition to develop tumors such as malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors (MPNSTs) which represents the primary cause of death for NF1-affected patients. Regardless of the high incidence and mortality, the molecular mechanisms underneath MPNST growth and metastatic progression remain poorly understood. In this proof-of-concept study, we performed somatic whole-exome sequencing (WES) to profile the genomic alterations in four samples from a patient with NF1-associated MPNST, consisting of a benign plexiform neurofibroma, a primary MPNST, and metastases from lung and skin tissues. By comparing genomic patterns, we identified a high level of variability across samples with distinctive genetic changes which allow for the definition of profiles of the early phase with respect to the late metastatic stages. Pathogenic and likely pathogenic variants were abundant in the primary tumor, whereas the metastatic samples exhibited a high level of copy-number variations (CNVs), highlighting a possible genomic instability in the late phases. The most known MPNST-related genes, such as <italic toggle=""yes"">TP53</italic> and <italic toggle=""yes"">SUZ12</italic>, were identified in CNVs observed within the primary tumor. Pathway analysis of altered early genes in MPNST pointed to a potential role in cell motility, division and metabolism. Moreover, we employed survival analysis with the <italic toggle=""yes"">TCGA</italic> sarcoma genomic dataset on 262 affected patients, in order to corroborate the predictive significance of the identified early and metastatic MPNST driver genes. Specifically, the expression changes related to the mutated genes, such as in <italic toggle=""yes"">RBMX</italic>, <italic toggle=""yes"">PNPLA6</italic> and <italic toggle=""yes"">AGAP2</italic>, were associated with reduced patient survival, distinguishing them as potential prognostic biomarkers. This study underlines the relevance of integrating genomic results with clinical information for early diagnosis and prognostic understanding of tumor aggressiveness.","Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) is a neurocutaneous autosomal dominant disorder, with a birth incidence of 1:3500, caused by a heterozygous inactivating mutation in the tumor suppressor NF1 gene (17q11.2) [<xref rid=""B1-ijms-25-10822"" ref-type=""bibr"">1</xref>,<xref rid=""B2-ijms-25-10822"" ref-type=""bibr"">2</xref>,<xref rid=""B3-ijms-25-10822"" ref-type=""bibr"">3</xref>]. Clinical manifestations of NF1 are highly variable, mainly consisting in multiple café-au-lait macules (CALMs), axillary and inguinal freckling, Lisch nodules, and cutaneous and plexiform neurofibromas. Some individuals also develop skeletal abnormalities, intellective disabilities and attention deficits, brain tumors and malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor (MPNST) [<xref rid=""B2-ijms-25-10822"" ref-type=""bibr"">2</xref>,<xref rid=""B4-ijms-25-10822"" ref-type=""bibr"">4</xref>]. Indeed, <italic toggle=""yes"">NF1</italic> is a tumor suppressor gene which encodes for Neurofibromin, a GTPase-activating protein (GAP) for the RAS family of proto-oncogenes, which induces a conformational change that stimulates the intrinsic GTPasic activity of the Ras protein [<xref rid=""B1-ijms-25-10822"" ref-type=""bibr"">1</xref>,<xref rid=""B5-ijms-25-10822"" ref-type=""bibr"">5</xref>]. Loss of neurofibromin leads to persistent RAS signaling and uncontrolled cellular growth through downstream RAF, MEK, and ERK signaling [<xref rid=""B6-ijms-25-10822"" ref-type=""bibr"">6</xref>]. Malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor (MPNST) is a rare soft tissue sarcoma, with an incidence in the general population of 1.46/100,000, originating from Schwann cells [<xref rid=""B7-ijms-25-10822"" ref-type=""bibr"">7</xref>]. MPNST may occur sporadically in 45% of cases, while half of these tumors are associated with the NF1 [<xref rid=""B8-ijms-25-10822"" ref-type=""bibr"">8</xref>]. Similarly to other soft-tissue sarcomas, surgical resection is currently the first-choice treatment. Nonetheless, it is often compromised by the large size of the tumors, usually due to late diagnosis, and by their proximity to complex nerve networks [<xref rid=""B1-ijms-25-10822"" ref-type=""bibr"">1</xref>,<xref rid=""B9-ijms-25-10822"" ref-type=""bibr"">9</xref>]. Due to its invasive growth and propensity to metastasize, MPNSTs have a poor prognosis and represent the primary cause of mortality for NF1-affected patients. The primary risk factors for developing MPNST rely on existing plexiform neurofibromas (PN), histologically benign tumors, which develop from Schwann cell biallelic <italic toggle=""yes"">NF1</italic> inactivation occurring in nearly 30–50% of NF1 patients [<xref rid=""B1-ijms-25-10822"" ref-type=""bibr"">1</xref>,<xref rid=""B5-ijms-25-10822"" ref-type=""bibr"">5</xref>,<xref rid=""B7-ijms-25-10822"" ref-type=""bibr"">7</xref>,<xref rid=""B8-ijms-25-10822"" ref-type=""bibr"">8</xref>]. A fundamental aspect of clinical practice for NF1 patients is monitoring PN for signs of transformation to MPNST, which occurs in 8–15% of patients [<xref rid=""B10-ijms-25-10822"" ref-type=""bibr"">10</xref>]. However, malignant transformation from PN to MPNST is difficult to diagnose because of the impossibility of performing serial PN biopsies for NF1 patients who, in many cases, have multiple PNs and, furthermore, cross-sectional imaging cannot distinguish MPNST from PN with adequate specificity [<xref rid=""B11-ijms-25-10822"" ref-type=""bibr"">11</xref>,<xref rid=""B12-ijms-25-10822"" ref-type=""bibr"">12</xref>,<xref rid=""B13-ijms-25-10822"" ref-type=""bibr"">13</xref>,<xref rid=""B14-ijms-25-10822"" ref-type=""bibr"">14</xref>]. Despite the high incidence and mortality of MPNST in the NF1 population, screening for malignant transformation and monitoring of MPNST is challenging. Currently, there is no clear understanding of the molecular mechanisms involved in the tumor transformation of MPNSTs. Major efforts are focused on the use of next-generation sequencing techniques, which have identified additional mutations or copy-number alterations of genes such as <italic toggle=""yes"">TP53</italic>, <italic toggle=""yes"">SUZ12</italic>, <italic toggle=""yes"">EGFR</italic>, <italic toggle=""yes"">CDKN2A</italic>, and <italic toggle=""yes"">TERT</italic>, not present in the benign form of PN, representing alterations associated with advanced progression to the atypical neurofibroma (AN) and MPNST [<xref rid=""B6-ijms-25-10822"" ref-type=""bibr"">6</xref>,<xref rid=""B15-ijms-25-10822"" ref-type=""bibr"">15</xref>,<xref rid=""B16-ijms-25-10822"" ref-type=""bibr"">16</xref>,<xref rid=""B17-ijms-25-10822"" ref-type=""bibr"">17</xref>,<xref rid=""B18-ijms-25-10822"" ref-type=""bibr"">18</xref>,<xref rid=""B19-ijms-25-10822"" ref-type=""bibr"">19</xref>,<xref rid=""B20-ijms-25-10822"" ref-type=""bibr"">20</xref>,<xref rid=""B21-ijms-25-10822"" ref-type=""bibr"">21</xref>,<xref rid=""B22-ijms-25-10822"" ref-type=""bibr"">22</xref>]. Therefore, high variability of the genomic context of MPNSTs, due to intra-tumor and substantial interpatient tumor heterogeneity, makes it difficult to identify a unique molecular signature [<xref rid=""B23-ijms-25-10822"" ref-type=""bibr"">23</xref>,<xref rid=""B24-ijms-25-10822"" ref-type=""bibr"">24</xref>]. In this work, we present a deep genomic characterization to implement an analytical model for the identification and evaluation of early molecular drivers in MPNST. Therefore, we performed whole exome sequencing (WES) on four tumor samples from a patient with MPNST-NF1-associated diagnosis—a benign sample, a primary tumor, a lung metastasis and a skin metastasis—and tested tumor-normal match approaches, with the aim of delineating the molecular alterations that contribute to the progression and metastasis of MPNST. Our results provide a basis for new studies, serving as a proof of concept, and reveal the necessity of systematically analyzing MPNSTs, combining pathology with genomic results, for improved early diagnosis.  In this study, we performed a genomic analysis of four samples from a single patient to detect driver genes associated with malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor (MPNST) and to identify a genetic signature specific for sporadic MPNST. Moreover, we propose a data mining approach to unravel the genetic complexity of this tumor, allowing us to determine and validate pathogenic variants and target pathways associated with its onset and growth. The investigation of whole exome sequencing data matching benign and tumor samples resulted in the identification of a different set of variants, as well as of biologically relevant genes and pathways associated with MPNST. Both the primary tumor and the metastatic samples resulted in an expected core of missense variants, with an enrichment for non-coding variants in the lung and skin metastasis. A small amount of evidence is currently available regarding the contribution of non-coding variants to NF1-associated tumors, which was argued for the first time by Sedant and colleagues [<xref rid=""B30-ijms-25-10822"" ref-type=""bibr"">30</xref>] and was just very recently reported by Liot and colleagues in Tenascin-X expression [<xref rid=""B31-ijms-25-10822"" ref-type=""bibr"">31</xref>] and by Tritto and colleagues in the Antisense non-coding RNA in the INK4 locus (ANRIL) [<xref rid=""B32-ijms-25-10822"" ref-type=""bibr"">32</xref>]. However, the contribution of non-coding variants to metastasis is increasingly observed in several types of cancers, such as adenocarcinoma [<xref rid=""B33-ijms-25-10822"" ref-type=""bibr"">33</xref>], gastric cancer [<xref rid=""B34-ijms-25-10822"" ref-type=""bibr"">34</xref>] and prostate cancer [<xref rid=""B35-ijms-25-10822"" ref-type=""bibr"">35</xref>]. Hence, our results are aligned with this observed trend and may shed light on novel targets for a specific MPNST signature. The tumor samples showed significant differences in the number of genes harboring pathogenic or likely pathogenic single-nucleotide variants. On the one hand, the primary tumor sample displayed the highest number of genes having a great overlap with those already reported to be associated with MPNST, such as the MET Proto-Oncogene, Receptor Tyrosine Kinase (<italic toggle=""yes"">MET</italic>), the Hepatocyte Growth Factor (<italic toggle=""yes"">HGF</italic>), and others. On the other hand, the limited knowledge currently available on MPNST metastasis was evident in the small number of genes already reported to be associated with MPNST, in other studies. Among them, five genes were shared between the two metastases: the DAZ-associated protein 1 (<italic toggle=""yes"">DAZAP1</italic>), the Lysine Methyltransferase 2C (<italic toggle=""yes"">KMT2C</italic>), the Mucin 12 (<italic toggle=""yes"">MUC12</italic>), the Myosin heavy chain 9 (<italic toggle=""yes"">MYH9</italic>), and the Supervillin (<italic toggle=""yes"">SVIL</italic>); these genes were already identified as taking part in metastasis progression in different types of cancer [<xref rid=""B36-ijms-25-10822"" ref-type=""bibr"">36</xref>,<xref rid=""B37-ijms-25-10822"" ref-type=""bibr"">37</xref>]. Moreover, the large number of variants identified in the primary tumor is likely attributed to its high heterogeneity, which may reflect the generation of numerous tumor clones. These clones, in turn, are likely selected in metastasis for their increased aggressiveness. Given the current limited knowledge of molecular mechanisms and genes involved in MPNST pathogenesis, the comparison of candidate genes selected for pathogenicity criteria (ACMG and AMP) in the primary tumor with those found in the literature has allowed the identification of not only genes with recurrent mutations, such as <italic toggle=""yes"">NF1</italic>, but also other genes potentially involved in the pathogenesis of the MPNST, including ATRX chromatin remodeler (<italic toggle=""yes"">ATRX</italic>) [<xref rid=""B20-ijms-25-10822"" ref-type=""bibr"">20</xref>,<xref rid=""B27-ijms-25-10822"" ref-type=""bibr"">27</xref>], Picolo Presynaptic Cytomatrix Protein (<italic toggle=""yes"">PCLO</italic>) [<xref rid=""B21-ijms-25-10822"" ref-type=""bibr"">21</xref>,<xref rid=""B27-ijms-25-10822"" ref-type=""bibr"">27</xref>], Low-Density Lipoprotein Receptor-Related Protein 1B (<italic toggle=""yes"">LRP1B</italic>) [<xref rid=""B20-ijms-25-10822"" ref-type=""bibr"">20</xref>,<xref rid=""B21-ijms-25-10822"" ref-type=""bibr"">21</xref>,<xref rid=""B25-ijms-25-10822"" ref-type=""bibr"">25</xref>,<xref rid=""B27-ijms-25-10822"" ref-type=""bibr"">27</xref>], Breast Cancer 2 (<italic toggle=""yes"">BRCA2)</italic> [<xref rid=""B21-ijms-25-10822"" ref-type=""bibr"">21</xref>], Erb-B2 Receptor Tyrosine Kinase 4 (<italic toggle=""yes"">ERBB4</italic>) [<xref rid=""B28-ijms-25-10822"" ref-type=""bibr"">28</xref>], and Laminin Subunit Alpha 2 (<italic toggle=""yes"">LAMA2</italic>) (Laminin Subunit Alpha 2) [<xref rid=""B20-ijms-25-10822"" ref-type=""bibr"">20</xref>,<xref rid=""B21-ijms-25-10822"" ref-type=""bibr"">21</xref>]. Except for <italic toggle=""yes"">ERBB4</italic>, known to promote the pathogenesis of malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor (MPNST) through mechanisms independent of Ras, [<xref rid=""B38-ijms-25-10822"" ref-type=""bibr"">38</xref>], all the remaining genes are well-known for taking part in types of cancer [<xref rid=""B39-ijms-25-10822"" ref-type=""bibr"">39</xref>,<xref rid=""B40-ijms-25-10822"" ref-type=""bibr"">40</xref>,<xref rid=""B41-ijms-25-10822"" ref-type=""bibr"">41</xref>,<xref rid=""B42-ijms-25-10822"" ref-type=""bibr"">42</xref>,<xref rid=""B43-ijms-25-10822"" ref-type=""bibr"">43</xref>], and could be promising targets for future studies. Moreover, our investigation was able to identify not only short variants, but also copy-number variations. CNV analyses reflected the tumor environment and its genomic instability: these variations were mostly identified in lung and skin metastasis, rather than in the primary tumor. In the primary tumor, CNVs were identified only in two genes that were already reported to be associated with MPNST: the Tumor protein 53 (<italic toggle=""yes"">TP53</italic>) and the SUZ12 polycomb repressive complex 2 subunit (<italic toggle=""yes"">SUZ12</italic>) [<xref rid=""B20-ijms-25-10822"" ref-type=""bibr"">20</xref>]. Despite the well-known role of TP53 in different types of cancer, the role of <italic toggle=""yes"">SUZ12</italic> was assessed in the last decade: alterations and losses in the polycomb repressive complex 2, of which <italic toggle=""yes"">SUZ12</italic> is a key component, cause signaling dysregulation and contribute to oncogenesis through cell proliferation and growth [<xref rid=""B44-ijms-25-10822"" ref-type=""bibr"">44</xref>,<xref rid=""B45-ijms-25-10822"" ref-type=""bibr"">45</xref>]. A great number of CNVs were observed in metastatic tumors, characterized by higher levels of instability and underlining tumor aggressiveness. A comparison between primary and metastatic tumor samples resulted in the identification of an opposite trend: the primary tumor shows an increased number of SNVs and small INDELs, rather than of CNVs; the metastatic tumors show an increase in the number of CNVs. According to various studies [<xref rid=""B46-ijms-25-10822"" ref-type=""bibr"">46</xref>,<xref rid=""B47-ijms-25-10822"" ref-type=""bibr"">47</xref>,<xref rid=""B48-ijms-25-10822"" ref-type=""bibr"">48</xref>], a high number of CNVs and a lower number of short variants (either SNVs or and small INDELs) in the metastases suggest a higher genomic plasticity during disease progression, which might reflect different mechanisms of tumor evolution. Furthermore, by investigating the type of molecular changes, we observed a great number of synonymous variants and variants with a low level of impact on the protein sequence, particularly in the primary tumors. Thereby, we tested different criteria based on ACMG pathogenic guidelines, AMP druggable variants, and predictive scores, to select candidate variants which may represent the tumor driver signature to validate in the next step of functional analysis. Novel candidate genes were also tested by survival analysis, mediated by expressional changes in genes carrying only pathogenic or likely pathogenic variants. The expressional changes of nine genes were found to significantly decrease patient survival in all the tumor samples, highlighting the reliability of our candidate gene list as putative drivers of pathogenic mechanisms. In the primary tumor, these changes were triggered by six genes, namely Patatin-Like Phospholipase Domain Containing 6 (<italic toggle=""yes"">PNPLA6</italic>), Complement C1s (<italic toggle=""yes"">C1S</italic>), Laminin Subunit Beta 3 (<italic toggle=""yes"">LAMB3</italic>), the Structural Maintenance Of Chromosomes 1A (<italic toggle=""yes"">SMC1A</italic>), and the Procollagen-Lysine,2-Oxoglutarate 5-Dioxygenase 2 (<italic toggle=""yes"">PLOD2</italic>); in the metastatic samples, these genes comprised the Arf GAP With GTPase Domain, Ankyrin Repeat And PH Domain 2 (<italic toggle=""yes"">AGAP2</italic>), the V-Set And Immunoglobulin Domain Containing 8 (<italic toggle=""yes"">VISG8</italic>), and the Serine Protease 2 (<italic toggle=""yes"">PRSS2</italic>) genes; the RNA Binding Motif Protein X-Linked (<italic toggle=""yes"">RBMX</italic>) was common to the primary and metastatic tumors. Apparently, these genes seemed unrelated to either NF1 or MPNST; however, both their biological roles and functional associations made them novel candidates for MPNST. Some of them are involved in the development of the nervous system and in neuron growth and differentiation, such as <italic toggle=""yes"">PNPLA6</italic> and <italic toggle=""yes"">AGAP2</italic>; others take part in the defense of our organisms, such as <italic toggle=""yes"">C1S</italic>, <italic toggle=""yes"">AGAP2</italic> and <italic toggle=""yes"">PRSS2</italic> in the immune system, and <italic toggle=""yes"">SMC1A</italic> and <italic toggle=""yes"">RBMX</italic> in DNA damage and repair. From a pathological perspective, all these genes were already reported to be associated with disorders similar or related to NF1 and MPNST. Among these, <italic toggle=""yes"">PNPLA6</italic> and <italic toggle=""yes"">RBMX</italic> are described in polyneuropathies and neurological disorders. Among the genes resulting from the primary tumor, <italic toggle=""yes"">LAMB3</italic> was already associated with nervus and brachial plexus neoplasms, conditions closely related to MPNST. On the other hand, genes resulting from skin and lung metastases were already reported to be associated with diseases in the respective tissues, such as <italic toggle=""yes"">AGAP2</italic> with skin cancer [<xref rid=""B49-ijms-25-10822"" ref-type=""bibr"">49</xref>] and <italic toggle=""yes"">VSIG8</italic> with respiratory syndromes [<xref rid=""B50-ijms-25-10822"" ref-type=""bibr"">50</xref>]. However, other candidate genes that do not significantly impact on patients’ survival were observed to be present in genomic sarcoma databases, representing a genomic scar of the MPNST. This significant overlap between the genomic profile of the primary tumor and the various datasets highlights the congruence between our sample and what is currently available on peripheral nerve sheath tumor, supporting the biological relevance of our observations. On the other hand, the low number of genes present in the dataset in common with the metastatic samples may be due to data being obtained specifically from nerve sheath tumor samples, which are therefore more relevant for the primary tumor than for metastasis. Pathways analysis confirmed the biological relevance of all the identified genes, either already reported to be associated with MPNST or novel findings. Among the most significant results, a cluster pointed at physiological cellular functions, such as cell motility and cell division. This is complemented by the results of the gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) conducted by Stricker et al., which demonstrated an enrichment of gene sets related to the G2-M checkpoint and chromosome condensation on MPNSTs [<xref rid=""B51-ijms-25-10822"" ref-type=""bibr"">51</xref>], and by Pemov et al.2017 [<xref rid=""B52-ijms-25-10822"" ref-type=""bibr"">52</xref>], which underlined critical pathways involved in processes such as the start of DNA replication, filament elongation, telomere maintenance and cell proliferation and differentiation already in the plexiform neurofibroma. These functions are also fundamental for tumor growth and development: when the functions of the associated genes are altered, these pathways become oncogenic, and thus might represent an oncogenic signature specific to the MPNST primary tumor or metastasis. The pathway of actin cytoskeleton regulation and focal adhesions plays a crucial role in tumor migration and metastasizing. However, it seems that these biological and cellular processes are already altered in the plexiform neurofibroma, as demonstrated by Grit et al., due to methylation events that alter the expression of the genes involved [<xref rid=""B53-ijms-25-10822"" ref-type=""bibr"">53</xref>]. Moreover, cell signaling and metabolism-related functions are associated with the candidate genes, confirming the importance of the metabolic switch observed in more aggressive tumors.  In summary, this work presented a deep genomic characterization of MPNST samples that underwent whole exome sequencing. This study represents an omni-comprehensive genomic approach to identify early molecular drivers in MPNST. Despite the small number of analyzed samples and the limits of using tissues from a single patient, this approach offers a proof of concept which might represent a standard procedure to investigate NF1-related tumors. To date, little knowledge exists regarding MPNST in terms of both molecular mechanisms and genetic variability. To unravel this rare complex tumor, different worldwide research centers gathered in the Genomics of MPNST (GeM) Consortium, to understand the genetic of MPNST from a multi-omics perspective [<xref rid=""B24-ijms-25-10822"" ref-type=""bibr"">24</xref>]. Overall, this investigation confirmed previously reported genes, as well as identifying novel candidate genes, proposing a prognostic oncogenic signature specifically tailored for MPNST.",N/A,09 10 2024
8251 The Silent Thief: Neurofibromatosis Type 1 (NF1) Leading to Severe Osteoporosis and Recurrent Bone Fractures,"
<bold>Disclosure:</bold> D.H. Sacoto: None. K. Madani: None. D. Patel: None. A. De Rosairo: None. G. Rai: None. A.A. Franco-Akel: None. R. Belokovskaya: None. 
<bold>Introduction:</bold> NF1 is an autosomal dominant disorder known to cause a remarkable reduction in bone mineral density (BMD) with almost a fivefold increase in fracture risk. Since fractures are associated with a high disability burden, early identification, prompt treatment, and consideration of prophylactic measures are important. We present a case of NF1 complicated with osteoporosis and recurrent bone fractures. <bold>Case presentation:</bold> An 85-year-old female with a history of NF1 complicated with a malignant left ankle Peripheral Nerve Sheet Tumor came in after a mechanical fall. Vital signs were stable. Examination demonstrated short stature, widespread cutaneous neurofibromas, and café au lait macules. Complain of generalized bone pain, in addition, to diffuse osseous demineralization on imaging and mild alkaline phosphatase elevation (141 U/L), led to further investigation, which revealed osteomalacia due to severe vitamin D deficiency (9.8 ng/mL) in the setting of malnutrition (albumin:3.4 mg/dL). Otherwise, normal renal function, phosphorus (3.7mg/dL) and calcium corrected for albumin (8.9 mg/dL). Previous records identified a right humerus close proximal fracture three years ago. At that time, a DEXA scan demonstrated severe osteoporosis with a lumbar T-score of -4.8 and dual femur of -3.7. She was started on Vitamin D supplementation, with questionable compliance. Bisphosphonates and denosumab were not prescribed due to the lack of guidelines on NF1 population. During the last two years, she experienced three more fractures, including a left femoral greater trochanteric, right 8th rib, and non-displaced pubic ramus fractures. One month ago, unfortunately, it expired due to septic shock. <bold>Discussion:</bold> Osteoporosis is found in 20–50% of NF1 patients, and it is associated with reduced serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D primarily due to a reduced expression of Vitamin D Receptor on neurofibromas in addition to reduced sun exposure and poor physical activity. At the molecular level, the loss of neurofibromin function causes a pathological increase in intracellular Ras activity, leading to an induction of osteoclastic activity and inhibition of osteoblastic differentiation. Currently, NF1 patients are resistant to bisphosphonate-induced apoptotic signals, and there are no guidelines for the use of denosumab in NF1 with osteoporosis. However, a recent clinical trial involving 141 NF1 adults identified that weight-bearing exercise, optimizing calcium and 25-hydroxyvitamin D intake and increased sun exposure can minimize BMD loss. However, guidelines for the management of bone abnormalities in NF1, including earlier screening and prophylactic therapy with vitamin D, are needed.

<bold>Introduction:</bold> Pheochromocytomas and paragangliomas (PPGLs) are the tumors with the highest heritability in adult patients, with identification of a germline mutation in more than 30% of cases. Up to 20 susceptibility genes for PPGLs are known, including <italic toggle=""yes"">NF1</italic>. Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) is an inherited disease affecting approximately 1 in 3000 people that predisposes to the development of tumors, such as pheochromocytomas (PHEO). Up to recently, the diagnosis of NF1 was mainly based on clinical manifestations and <italic toggle=""yes"">NF1</italic> genetic characterization was not systematically performed. <bold>Objectives:</bold> To characterize germline pathogenic variants in the <italic toggle=""yes"">NF1</italic> gene in patients with NF1 developing and PHEO. <bold>Methods:</bold> We reviewed the charts of patients with a pathology-proven diagnosis of PHEOs that were investigated at Centre hospitalier de l’Université de Montréal (CHUM) between 2000 and May 2023. Genetic analysis included gene sequencing by Sanger method or multigene sequencing by NGS with a panel (Invitae, CA) <bold>Results:</bold> In our cohort of 220 PHEOs, 15 patients (6.8%) (Males: 6, Females: 9) had a diagnosis of NF1. Mean age at diagnosis of PHEO in NF1 patients was 48 ± 13.6 years, contrasting to the mean age of 38,7 ± 15.2 years in patients carrying germline mutations in non-NF1 genes, most likely reflecting lack of systematic biochemically screening of PHEO in NF1. Urinary metanephrines were elevated in 9/15 patients. 2/15 (15.4%) NF1 patients had bilateral PHEO and 1/15 (7,7%) metastatic disease. Mean tumour diameter was 4.64cm (min-max 1.5 – 12.5 cm). Eight out of 15 NF1 patients underwent <italic toggle=""yes"">NF1</italic> genetic analysis. Heterozygous <italic toggle=""yes"">NF1</italic> germline pathogenic variants were found in all of them: 3 deletions (c.7379delG, c.5844_5845delAA and one encompassing the entire gene), 3 premature stop codons leading to truncated proteins or loss of function (c.7549C>T, c.3916C>T, c.1246C>T), and 2 splicing defects (c.4269+1 G>A, c.1885G>A). <bold>Conclusions:</bold> We report a large cohort of patients with NF1 and PHEO. The older age at diagnosis of PHEO in NF1 is expected based on lack of systematic biochemical screening for PHEO in NF1 clinical guidelines. We report 8 germline <italic toggle=""yes"">NF1</italic> mutations associated with PHEOs. Further studies are required to fully understand the impact of genetic pathogenic variants in this population and to unravel a possible genotype-phenotype correlation.

<italic toggle=""yes"">Introduction</italic>. Aside from other manifestations, neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) entails an increased risk for various neoplasms. Multiple cases of pituitary neuroendocrine tumors (PitNETs) in the setting of NF1 have been documented in the literature. Based on these findings, a role for <italic toggle=""yes"">NF1</italic> (17q11.2) loss-of-function (LOF) variants in pituitary tumorigenesis has been hypothesized, but causality remains unclear. <italic toggle=""yes"">Aim</italic>. To report a case of a PitNET associated with a germline <italic toggle=""yes"">NF1</italic> defect and to characterize the <italic toggle=""yes"">NF1</italic> genotype and expression in this lesion.<italic toggle=""yes"">Methods</italic>. The patient was recruited via an ongoing prospective study of individuals with neuroendocrine neoplasms. Genetic testing was carried out by means of two next generation sequencing (NGS) panels. DNA and/or RNA were extracted from blood and PitNET samples. Loss-of-heterozygosity was investigated via Sanger sequencing and <italic toggle=""yes"">NF1</italic> expression was analyzed via droplet digital polymerase chain reaction (ddPCR). Similar cases were searched in the literature. <italic toggle=""yes"">Results</italic>. A 54-year-old-man underwent a magnetic resonance imaging due to new-onset seizures. The study identified a 16 mm pituitary lesion, which was clinically non-functioning. A transsphenoidal resection was performed uneventfully, with histopathological report of a plurihormonal PitNET (positive for prolactin, GH, and ACTH) with Ki67<1%. This individual had a personal and family history compatible with NF1, and carried a germline pathogenic <italic toggle=""yes"">NF1</italic> variant (NM_001042492.3: c.147C>A, p.Y49*), detected via targeted NGS. The same heterozygous defect was confirmed in DNA from peripheral blood and both fresh frozen and FFPE tumor tissue. Additional NGS ruled out germline defects in PitNET-associated genes. By ddPCR, <italic toggle=""yes"">NF1</italic> was significantly overexpressed in the tumor, compared with another non-functioning PitNET (<italic toggle=""yes"">ACTB-</italic>normalized absolute quantification 0.07 vs 0.03, <italic toggle=""yes"">P</italic>=0.0381), but not in blood (<italic toggle=""yes"">P</italic>=0.4063). At least 14 well-documented cases of PitNETs occurring in the context of NF1 exist in the literature, with mean age at diagnosis of 34.7 ±21.5 years. Nine tumors were macroadenomas, seven were somatotropinomas, and all patients, except one, had clinical NF1. The diagnosis was genetically confirmed in seven cases and LOH was negative in the two cases where it was investigated. Two individuals developed multiple endocrine neoplasia-like phenotypes, but tested negative for other relevant genetic defects. <italic toggle=""yes"">Conclusions</italic>. We found <italic toggle=""yes"">NF1</italic> upregulation in the PitNET tissue, probably due compensatory increased transcription of the normal allele. Preserved heterozygosity at the affected locus was also observed, in line with previous data showing that LOH is not required for the development of benign tumors in this setting. Further research is required to determine if <italic toggle=""yes"">NF1</italic> defects might indeed drive pituitary tumorigenesis.

A successful combined spinal-epidural anesthesia for cesarean section in a patient with neurofibromatosis type 1-associated dural ectasia,,"Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF-1) is an autosomal dominant disorder that affects the ectodermal and mesodermal tissues [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR1"">1</xref>]. NF-1 patients present various clinical manifestations, including in the spine and nervous system [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR1"">1</xref>, <xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR2"">2</xref>]. The presence of scoliosis or spinal cord tumors renders the use of neuraxial anesthesia difficult [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR1"">1</xref>]. Dural ectasia, defined as ballooning or widening of the dural sac, is one of the common neuraxial manifestations of NF-1 [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR2"">2</xref>, <xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR3"">3</xref>]. While the association between dural ectasia in patients with Marfan syndrome and spinal anesthesia failure is well documented [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR4"">4</xref>, <xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR5"">5</xref>], similar occurrences in NF-1 have not been reported. We herein report a case of cesarean section (C-section) in an NF-1 patient with dural ectasia who had a history of failed spinal anesthesia during the previous C-section. A 34-year-old parturient (158 cm, 49.8 kg, gravida 2, para 1) was referred and admitted to our hospital for severe preeclampsia at 24 weeks’ gestation. During childhood, she was diagnosed with NF-1 but did not receive any follow-up care. During her previous pregnancy at 31 years old, she underwent a C-section at 38 weeks’ gestation due to a breech presentation at a different medical facility, where spinal anesthesia was converted to general anesthesia due to an inadequate block. At 32 years old, she underwent right total hip replacement for osteoarthritis under general anesthesia at a different medical facility. In anticipation of a repeat C-section, she was referred for a preanesthesia consultation at 25 weeks’ gestation. Her blood pressure was controlled within the goal range with oral nifedipine. Blood and urine tests ruled out pheochromocytoma, a possible NF-1 complication. She had cutaneous neurofibromas and café-au-lait spots on the trunk. Neurological examination was normal, and no sensory or motor deficit was observed. Ultrasound examination revealed no subcutaneous masses that would interfere with the neuraxial anesthesia procedures. The distance from the skin to the posterior complex at the L3-4 level was 3 cm. We performed magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to explore the possibility of spinal tumors. The MRI images showed no spinal tumors but revealed dilatation of the dural sac, posterior scalloping of the vertebral bodies, and a radicular cyst at the right L2-3 neural foramen (Fig. <xref rid=""Fig1"" ref-type=""fig"">1</xref>), which led to a diagnosis of dural ectasia. The dural ectasia, which may not have been previously detected, was suspected to be the cause of failed spinal anesthesia during the previous C-section. MRI imaging revealed an epidural space for possible epidural catheterization. The patient was informed of the risk–benefit of general versus neuraxial anesthesia, including the potential neurological complications associated with neuraxial anesthesia. After thoroughly explaining, we respected the patient’s preference to proceed with combined spinal-epidural anesthesia (CSEA) using the needle-through-needle technique.<fig id=""Fig1""><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p><bold>a</bold> Sagittal MRI showed widening of the dural sac and posterior scalloping of the vertebral bodies from L1 to L3 (arrows).

Local anesthesia with 1% lidocaine was administered under standard noninvasive monitoring and in the sitting position. An 18-gauge Tuohy needle (Smiths Medical Japan Ltd., Tokyo, Japan) was inserted into the epidural space at the L3–4 interspace. Subsequently, dural puncture was performed using a 27-gauge spinal needle (Smiths Medical Japan Ltd.). After checking aspiration for clear cerebrospinal fluid, 2.4 mL of 0.5% hyperbaric bupivacaine combined with 15 µg of fentanyl was intrathecally administered. Finally, an epidural catheter was placed 4 cm into the epidural space. As the bilateral sensory block level evaluated via a cold sensation was below L1 after 5 min, a total of 12 mL of 2% lidocaine with 1:200,000 epinephrine was administered in 3-mL increments through the epidural catheter. After confirming sensory block of the T6 level, the surgery was commenced. The patient delivered a 597-g infant with Apgar scores of 6 and 8 at 1 and 5 min, respectively. At the end of the surgery, the sensory block level was T4, and then the epidural catheter was removed before leaving the operating room. The postoperative course was uneventful without any complications, including postdural puncture headache, and the patient was discharged on postoperative day 7. We experienced a successful CSEA for a C-section of a patient with NF-1-associated dual ectasis. When performing neuraxial anesthesia in patients with NF-1, dural ectasia should be considered as a potential complication. CSEA can be a useful anesthetic option. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first case report of spinal anesthesia failure in an NF-1 patient due to dural ectasia. Dural ectasia has been extensively described in Marfan syndrome, with its prevalence ranging from 63 to 92% [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR6"">6</xref>, <xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR7"">7</xref>]. A previous review of NF-1 found a 25.7% incidence of dural ectasia [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR2"">2</xref>], suggesting that it is not a rare manifestation of NF-1. In cases of dural ectasia, spinal anesthesia failure is considered to be caused by increased cerebrospinal fluid volume in the distended dural sac, which restricts the spread of intrathecally injected local anesthetic [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR4"">4</xref>, <xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR5"">5</xref>]. The success of spinal anesthesia differs based on the extent of dural ectasia [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR8"">8</xref>]. Based on the grading system developed by Fattori et al. [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR7"">7</xref>], our patient, the MRI of whom revealed expanded dural sac and small radicular cyst, was classified as having mild dural ectasia. The present case showed that even the presence of mild dural ectasia does not guarantee the success of spinal anesthesia. Case reports describing CSEA in patients with Marfan syndrome having dural ectasia are scarce [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR5"">5</xref>, <xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR8"">8</xref>, <xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR9"">9</xref>]. These reports indicated that while spinal anesthesia failed to provide adequate block levels for elective C-sections, epidural anesthesia was successfully employed without complications. Epidural anesthesia is not an absolute contraindication in patients with dural ectasia; however, it requires careful consideration and skillful technique due to the increased risk of dural puncture in moderate-to-severe cases [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR8"">8</xref>]. In our case, the MRI images facilitated the selection of CSEA. In an NF-1 parturient, the necessity of neuraxial imaging before neuraxial anesthesia is controversial. During pregnancy, neurofibromas can increase in size [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR10"">10</xref>], and the possibility of spinal tumor growth is a potential risk of neuraxial anesthesia. Older publications recommended avoiding neuraxial anesthesia in the absence of neuraxial imaging [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR11"">11</xref>, <xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR12"">12</xref>]. Meanwhile, the practice guideline from the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics states that preanesthetic neuraxial imaging is probably not required [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR13"">13</xref>]. However, these recommendations do not mention dural ectasia. Patients with dural ectasia may present with low back pain, radicular pain in the buttocks or legs, or headache, but most, like our case, are asymptomatic [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR14"">14</xref>]. The lack of neuraxial imaging may lead to oversight of asymptomatic dural ectasia. Therefore, we consider that neuraxial imaging is beneficial to enhancing patient safety when performing neuraxial anesthesia in NF-1 patients. In a patient with increased intracranial pressure caused by an enlarged intracranial tumor, neuraxial anesthesia can result in brain herniation [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR11"">11</xref>]. In the present case, we did not perform brain MRI due to the absence of symptoms, such as headache, nausea, vomiting, and visual disturbances. If there are concerns, a brain MRI may be advisable for safety assurance.",N/A,1 10 2024
Coronary Artery Aneurysm Thrombosis Causing Acute Myocardial Infarction in an Adolescent With Neurofibromatosis Type 1,"Acute myocardial infarction is a rare though possible occurrence in young patients, especially with predisposing conditions, and the treatment is still debated. We present the case of a teenager known to have neurofibromatosis type 1 with acute coronary syndrome caused by coronary aneurysms and thrombotic occlusion of the left circumflex artery treated with a stent-sparing strategy. ","The patient’s family history revealed that both the mother and the twin brother were affected by neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF-1). The patient had received that diagnosis at the age of 6 years following the onset of dermatologic manifestations. There was no history of fever or recent infection, so suspicion of myocardial or pericardial involvement was unlikely. The patient underwent cardiovascular assessment through physical examination, electrocardiogram (ECG), and transthoracic echocardiography, without any pathologic finding. No other relevant comorbidities were reported, and the patient was not taking any medication. His weight at admission was 48 kg.

Transthoracic echocardiography showed a moderate reduction in left ventricular ejection fraction (40%), with inferior and posterior wall akinesia and mild functional mitral regurgitation; there was no pericardial effusion; right ventricular function was normal; and congenital heart defects were excluded. Blood tests showed an initial rise in high-sensitive troponin I, which was 0.36 ng/mL (normal value: <0.034 ng/mL), blood count was normal, and there was no rise in C-reactive protein level.<fig id=""fig1""><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Clinical Presentation and Baseline Coronary Angiography</p><p>At hospital admission, electrocardiogram shows posterior myocardial infarction.

Cold Atmospheric Plasma Induces Growth Arrest and Apoptosis in Neurofibromatosis Type 1-Associated Peripheral Nerve Sheath Tumor Cells,"Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) is an autosomal dominant disorder resulting from mutations in the <italic toggle=""yes"">NF1</italic> gene. Patients harboring these mutations are predisposed to a spectrum of peripheral nerve sheath tumors (PNSTs) originating from Schwann cells, of which malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors (MPNSTs) are the deadliest, with limited treatment options. Therefore, an unmet need still exists for more effective therapies directed at these aggressive malignancies. Cold atmospheric plasma (CAP) is a reactive oxygen species (ROS) and reactive nitrogen species (RNS) generating ionized gas that has been proposed to be a potential therapeutic modality for cancer. In this study, we sought to determine the effects of CAP on NF1-associated PNSTs. Utilizing established mouse and human cell lines to interrogate the effects of CAP in both in vitro and in vivo settings, we found that NF1-associated PNSTs were highly sensitive to CAP exposure, resulting in cell death. To our knowledge, this is the first application of CAP to NF1-associated PNSTs and provides a unique opportunity to study the complex biology of NF1-associated tumors.","Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) is an autosomal dominant disorder stemming from mutations in the <italic toggle=""yes"">NF1</italic> gene on chromosome 17q11.2, which leads to a hyperactive RAS signaling pathway. Affecting 1 in 3000 individuals worldwide, approximately 50% of NF1 patients develop plexiform neurofibromas (PNs), a histologically benign heterogeneous nervous sheath tumor arising from Schwann cells that display harbor a biallelic <italic toggle=""yes"">NF1</italic> inactivation. PNs can be painful and disfiguring, adversely impacting quality of life. Of greater concern are the 8–15% of PNs that can spontaneously transform into malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors (MPNSTs), which are aggressive cancers with a dismal prognosis [<xref rid=""B1-biomedicines-12-01986"" ref-type=""bibr"">1</xref>]. Despite maximal multimodal therapies, including chemotherapy, surgery, and radiotherapy, MPNSTs are the primary driver of mortality in NF1 patients who lack reliable therapeutic options [<xref rid=""B2-biomedicines-12-01986"" ref-type=""bibr"">2</xref>]. Surgery is the primary treatment for these tumors, but it can be challenging depending on their anatomical location, and complete resection is generally recommended to prevent tumor regrowth [<xref rid=""B3-biomedicines-12-01986"" ref-type=""bibr"">3</xref>]. Despite the recent approval of selumetinib, a MEK inhibitor for symptomatic and inoperable PNs, it is not curative and it is unknown whether MEK inhibition prevents transformation of PNs to MPNSTs [<xref rid=""B4-biomedicines-12-01986"" ref-type=""bibr"">4</xref>]. Cold atmospheric plasma (CAP) offers a new solution for selective anticancer therapy, where a noble gas such as helium is fed into a high-voltage environment, leading to an ionized gas (<xref rid=""biomedicines-12-01986-f001"" ref-type=""fig"">Figure 1</xref>) [<xref rid=""B5-biomedicines-12-01986"" ref-type=""bibr"">5</xref>]. Existing in a state of non-thermal equilibrium at room temperature, CAP contains reactive oxygen and nitrogen species (RONS) that can be applied to living tissues. CAP has shown promise in many aggressive and difficult-to-treat cancers either directly to the tissue or indirectly via an intermediate medium [<xref rid=""B6-biomedicines-12-01986"" ref-type=""bibr"">6</xref>,<xref rid=""B7-biomedicines-12-01986"" ref-type=""bibr"">7</xref>]. In the context of solid tumors, CAP has exhibited efficacy across diverse types, even in recurrent cases where traditional multimodal therapies have limited effectiveness [<xref rid=""B8-biomedicines-12-01986"" ref-type=""bibr"">8</xref>,<xref rid=""B9-biomedicines-12-01986"" ref-type=""bibr"">9</xref>]. Furthermore, it has been postulated that CAP could offer more selective cytotoxicity in cancer cells compared to normal cells [<xref rid=""B10-biomedicines-12-01986"" ref-type=""bibr"">10</xref>]. Despite its promise as a potential therapeutic option, to date, CAP has not been tested in NF1-associated peripheral nerve sheath tumors (PNSTs), including PNs and MPNSTs. Due to the prevalence of these lesions in patients with NF1 and that not all PNs can be surgically excised, it is crucial to explore and develop alternative novel treatment modalities. Therefore, we hypothesized that CAP could also be applied to NF1-associated tumors. To investigate the role of CAP in NF1-associated PNSTs, we conducted a dose–response assessment of CAP exposure in multiple established NF1-associated cell lines. We report that NF1-associated cell lines have a dose–response effect with CAP exposure, providing novel clues for its mechanism of action. We also demonstrate the in vivo efficacy of CAP exposure for MPNST xenografted tumors, demonstrating that CAP exposure could be a promising therapeutic solution for NF1 patients. <bold>CAP device and treatment.</bold> A single electrode found within a plastic tapered shell formed from a pipette tip was used as a delivery tool [<xref rid=""B11-biomedicines-12-01986"" ref-type=""bibr"">11</xref>,<xref rid=""B12-biomedicines-12-01986"" ref-type=""bibr"">12</xref>,<xref rid=""B13-biomedicines-12-01986"" ref-type=""bibr"">13</xref>]. The shell directs the flow of high-purity helium down the length of the electrode to the tip, where it was ionized, and out to the target (<xref rid=""biomedicines-12-01986-f001"" ref-type=""fig"">Figure 1</xref>). The electrode, formed from sharpened copper wire, was supplied with a 1.4 kV peak-to-peak sinusoidal voltage oscillating at 52 kHz. The electrode had a thin insulating coating above the tip. Helium flow was set to 1.21 L/min throughout the experiments. The electronic signal supplied to the electrode was generated using custom step-up electronics in combination with a BK Precision 4013 DDS Sweep Function Generator (BK Precision Corporation, Yorba Linda, CA, USA) and a CPX400DP—Dual 420 Watt PowerFlex DC PSU (Aim-TTi, Cambridgeshire, England, UK). The tip of the CAP shell was placed about 1 cm above the sample throughout the experiments. Two experimental delivery methods were tested: (1) direct CAP (dCAP), where both cells and medium are exposed to CAP together, and (2) indirect CAP (iCAP), where the culture medium only is exposed to CAP to create a plasma-conditioned medium (PCM), which is then transferred to cell-containing wells (<xref rid=""biomedicines-12-01986-f001"" ref-type=""fig"">Figure 1</xref>).  <bold>Cell lines and culture.</bold> The ESC-FC1208NF1 (<italic toggle=""yes"">Nf1</italic><sup>−/−</sup>) and ESC-FH1208NF1 (<italic toggle=""yes"">Nf1</italic>-WT) cell lines were derived from <italic toggle=""yes"">Nf1<sup>flox</sup></italic><sup>/<italic toggle=""yes"">flox</italic></sup> mouse embryonic primary Schwann cell cultures that were (ESC-FC1208NF1) or were not (ESC-FH1208NF1) infected with Adenovirus-Cre and cultured in N2 medium, as previously described [<xref rid=""B14-biomedicines-12-01986"" ref-type=""bibr"">14</xref>,<xref rid=""B15-biomedicines-12-01986"" ref-type=""bibr"">15</xref>]. The NF1-mutated plexiform neurofibromas (CRL-3387, CRL-3389, CRL-3390) cell lines, human NF1<sup>+/−</sup> (CRL-3391), and NF1 WT (CRL-3392) Schwann cell lines were purchased from ATCC through the Neurofibromatosis Therapeutic Acceleration Program (NTAP) [<xref rid=""B16-biomedicines-12-01986"" ref-type=""bibr"">16</xref>].

Cells were cultured in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (DMEM) (Invitrogen, Waltham, MA, USA) with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) (Invitrogen) and 1% penicillin/streptomycin (100 U/mL; Invitrogen) at 37°C in 5% CO<sub>2</sub>.  <bold>in vitro cell viability.</bold> Cell lines were seeded in a 96-well plate at a density that would lead to 70–80% confluence per well at 48 h after CAP exposure.

Cell viability was measured using the ATPlite 1-Step Luminescence Assay System (Perkin-Elmer, Boston, MA, USA) following the manufacturer’s protocol. Each experimental condition was tested in triplicate, and results were normalized to untreated wells.  <bold>Assessment of apoptosis and necrosis.</bold> Cells were seeded in 200 µL of growth medium in white 96-well microtiter plates at the concentration of 6000 cells per well in 4 technical replicates. Control wells with cell culture medium only to determine background luminescence and background fluorescence were included. In addition, control wells with cells without CAP exposure were also included. In a separate 96 well plate, 200 µL of CAP was exposed for 180 s, and then 100 µL were transferred to the cell-containing wells. Serial dilution, per manufacturer’s instructions, was then performed. In total, 50 µL of 2× concentrated RealTime-Glo™ Annexin V Apoptosis and Necrosis Detection Reagent (ProMega, Madison, WI, USA) in growth medium was added to each well. Cells were incubated in a covered 96-well assay plate at 37 °C 5% CO<sub>2</sub> in a humidified cell culture incubator.

The subcutaneous <italic toggle=""yes"">NF1<sup>−</sup><sup>/−</sup></italic> S462TY human MPNST xenograft model has been previously described [<xref rid=""B18-biomedicines-12-01986"" ref-type=""bibr"">18</xref>]. The iCAP method was evaluated on mice using the S462TY MPNST cell line xenografted subcutaneously into their flank (1 × 10<sup>7</sup> cells). Mice weight and tumor volume measurements were taken 3 times per week. Volume was assessed using perpendicular measurements with a caliper and was calculated using the formula: Length × Width<sup>2</sup> × (π/6). Tumors were allowed to establish until their volume reached 100 mm<sup>3</sup>, at which point CAP exposure was performed. The mice were randomized to the control or iCAP groups based on tumor volume by ordering them from largest to smallest volume to ensure there was no statistically significant difference between the two groups (<xref rid=""app1-biomedicines-12-01986"" ref-type=""app"">Figure S1</xref>). The mice were anesthetically induced by inhalation of isoflurane. For iCAP exposure, 200 µL of PBS was exposed for 180 s in a 96-well plate, and 100 µL of the CAP-exposed medium was immediately injected in the middle of the tumor mass. For control mice, 100 µL of PBS after 180 s of helium exposure was injected in the middle of the tumor mass. Weight and tumor volume measurements were taken from mice during approximately four weeks post-exposure before euthanasia and excision of the tumor. Tissues were fixed for 24 h in formalin and embedded in paraffin, following standard protocols. <bold>Cleaved caspase 3 histologic staining.</bold> Paraffin-embedded sections were cut at 4 μm thickness. The paraffin was subsequently removed with xylene and rehydrated through graded ethanol. Endogenous peroxidase activity was blocked with 3% hydrogen peroxide in methanol for 10 min. Heat-induced epitope retrieval (HIER) was carried out for all sections in AR9 buffer (AR9001KT, Akoya Biosciences, Menlo Park, CA, USA) using a Biocare Decloaker at 95 <sup>o</sup>C for 25 min. The slides were then stained with Cleaved Caspase-3 (Asp175) (#9661, Cell Signaling, Boston, MA, USA) at room temperature for 1 h. The Cleaved Caspase-3 signal was detected using the Dakocytomation Envision + System Labelled Polymer HRP anti-rabbit (K400311-2, Agilent, Santa Clara, CA, USA). All sections were visualized via the diaminobenzidine reaction and counterstained with hematoxylin. <bold>Ki67 histologic staining.</bold> For Ki67 staining, automated detection was performed using a Leica Bond RX processor with the following steps based on Protocol F using the Bond Polymer Refine Detection kit (DS9800, Leica Biosystems, Deer Park, IL, USA). Briefly, the “Bake and Dewax” protocol on the Leica BOND System was utilized. Subsequently, HIER using the ER2 (BOND Epitope Retrieval Solution 2, Leica Biosystems, Cat# AR9640) buffer was performed at 100 °C for 20 min. After a 5 min peroxide block, slides were washed with BOND wash buffer three times followed by a 60 min incubation with the Ki67 primary antibody (Ab 92742, Abcam, Cambridge, UK). BOND wash buffer was applied three times in conjunction with a 10 min incubation period with Dakocytomation Envision System Labelled Polymer Horseradish Peroxidase (HRP) anti-rabbit (K400311-2, Agilent, Santa Clara, CA, USA). After incubation with the polymer, BOND wash buffer was placed on the slides five times, washed with deionized water, and incubated with Mixed DAB Refine for 10 min. Slides were subsequently washed with deionized water three times, incubated with hematoxylin for 10 min, washed with BOND wash buffer three times, and then washed again with deionized water. Slides were then dehydrated in series of alcohols, cleared with histoclear, and mounted with Permount. <bold>Histological analysis.</bold> Cleaved Caspase 3 and Ki67 slides were scanned and analyzed using digital pathology software QuPath 0.4.4. The area of quantification for each slide was manually selected to cover the whole tissue area while avoiding analysis of necrosed regions and artifacts. The positive cell detection function was utilized for determining the percentage of stained cells. Parameters were set up for the optical density sum with a pixel size of 0.5 µm and a background radius of 8 µm. The single intensity threshold was set at 0.4 for Cleaved Caspase 3 and 0.2 for Ki67, the sigma level was 1.5 µm, and the cell area range was from 10 µm<sup>2</sup> to 400 µm<sup>2</sup>. <bold>Statistical Analysis.</bold> All results are presented as means ± SEM. Tukey post hoc tests and one-way or two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) tests were used for multiple comparisons (when more than two groups or 2 variables were compared). Student’s t-test was used for comparisons between two groups. All statistical analyses were carried out with the Prism software package (Prism 10.2.3, GraphPad Software, 2024). The threshold for statistical significance was <italic toggle=""yes"">p</italic> ≤ 0.05. <bold>NF1-associated tumor cell lines are sensitive to CAP</bold>. We sought to explore the efficacy of CAP in NF1-associated tumors. As such, to study the impact of CAP on NF1-associated tumor cell death, we first evaluated cell death in vitro at different CAP exposure times at 10, 30, 60, 90, and 180 s, utilizing dCAP and iCAP (<xref rid=""biomedicines-12-01986-f001"" ref-type=""fig"">Figure 1</xref>b) [<xref rid=""B19-biomedicines-12-01986"" ref-type=""bibr"">19</xref>]. Cell viability was assessed at 48 h after CAP exposure using the ATPlite 1-Step Luminescence Assay and was normalized to untreated controls. Across all NF1 cell lines, there was a progressive dose–response effect with lower cell viability at longer CAP exposure, and there was no difference between dCAP and iCAP (<xref rid=""biomedicines-12-01986-f002"" ref-type=""fig"">Figure 2</xref>). Furthermore, we observed a significant lower viability of the mouse <italic toggle=""yes"">NF1<sup>−</sup></italic><sup>/<italic toggle=""yes"">−</italic></sup> compared to the mouse <italic toggle=""yes"">NF1</italic>-wild-type (WT) Schwann cell lines (<xref rid=""biomedicines-12-01986-f002"" ref-type=""fig"">Figure 2</xref>a,b).  We next assessed the role of CAP on human Schwann cells, the cell of origin for NF1-associated PNST in patients. We observed that the <italic toggle=""yes"">NF1</italic>-heterozygous human Schwann cells is more sensitive to iCAP treatment than <italic toggle=""yes"">NF1</italic>-WT human Schwann cells (<xref rid=""biomedicines-12-01986-f002"" ref-type=""fig"">Figure 2</xref>c,d). Cell viability of three NF1-associated PNs with different <italic toggle=""yes"">NF1</italic> genetic mutations was also affected by CAP treatment, although it showed individual differences in the extent of sensitivity (<xref rid=""biomedicines-12-01986-f002"" ref-type=""fig"">Figure 2</xref>e,f). Finally, three MPNST cell lines showed sensitivity to both dCAP and iCAP, with difference in response observed between the two NF1-associated MPNSTs (S462TY and 88-14), likely due to tumor heterogeneity (<xref rid=""biomedicines-12-01986-f002"" ref-type=""fig"">Figure 2</xref>g,h).

However, to date, no study has investigated the mechanism of CAP-induced cell death in NF1-associated PNSTs. To gain insight into how CAP affects PNST cells, NF1-associated PNST cell lines were exposed to 180 s of iCAP, and quantitative analysis was conducted utilizing the RealTime-Glo Annexin V Apoptosis and Necrosis Assay. We observed that across all cell lines, tumor cell death after CAP treatment occurred mainly through apoptosis rather than necrosis, as validated with a positive control (Staurosporine) and a negative control (no CAP exposure) (<xref rid=""biomedicines-12-01986-f003"" ref-type=""fig"">Figure 3</xref>, <xref rid=""app1-biomedicines-12-01986"" ref-type=""app"">Figures S1 and S2</xref>).

For the <italic toggle=""yes"">NF1<sup>+</sup></italic><sup>/<italic toggle=""yes"">−</italic></sup> Schwann cell, wild-type Schwann cell, and NF1-associated plexiform neurofibroma (CRL-3387), there was no significant difference in all cell cycle phases after CAP exposure (<xref rid=""biomedicines-12-01986-f004"" ref-type=""fig"">Figure 4</xref>a–f). For the NF1-associated MPNST cell line S462TY, there were proportionally more cells in the G1 phase at the 24 h mark, suggesting that cells arrested in the G1 phase are prone to apoptosis, cell death, and increased cellular debris (<xref rid=""biomedicines-12-01986-f004"" ref-type=""fig"">Figure 4</xref>h). To ensure that these findings were not due to artifacts, cell imaging was performed in parallel with no aggregates or mislabeled cells observed (<xref rid=""app1-biomedicines-12-01986"" ref-type=""app"">Figure S3</xref>).  <bold>iCAP treatment inhibits in vivo tumor growth in an NF1-associated MPNST xenograft mouse model.</bold> Based on these results, we next evaluated the in vivo antitumor activity of iCAP. We utilized an NF1-associated MPNST cell line, S462TY (<xref rid=""biomedicines-12-01986-f005"" ref-type=""fig"">Figure 5</xref>a)<bold>.</bold> Longitudinal measurements of tumor volume demonstrated that tumor growth was abrogated in the treatment group, although this effect did not become statistically significant until Day 27 (<xref rid=""biomedicines-12-01986-f005"" ref-type=""fig"">Figure 5</xref>b and <xref rid=""app1-biomedicines-12-01986"" ref-type=""app"">Figure S8</xref>). Tumor growth started to slow down in the CAP-treated group at day 10 post CAP exposure, but was not statistically significant. To confirm the mechanism involved in CAP treatment, the expression of the Ki67 protein and cleaved Caspase 3 was analyzed using immunohistochemical staining, which showed significantly increased cleaved Caspase 3 and attenuated Ki67 staining in the CAP-exposed xenografts (<xref rid=""biomedicines-12-01986-f005"" ref-type=""fig"">Figure 5</xref>c,d).  Although our current understanding of CAP and its anti-tumoral effects have yet to be fully elucidated, our studies indicate that NF1-associated PNST cell lines are sensitive to CAP-induced cell death. This observation has been made in other contexts, where increased CAP time exposure leads to greater cell death [<xref rid=""B20-biomedicines-12-01986"" ref-type=""bibr"">20</xref>]. Previous work has shown that cells did not survive beyond 180 s of CAP exposure [<xref rid=""B21-biomedicines-12-01986"" ref-type=""bibr"">21</xref>,<xref rid=""B22-biomedicines-12-01986"" ref-type=""bibr"">22</xref>]. We have observed that apoptosis is a primary driver of cell death in these NF1 tumors following CAP exposure, similarly to other groups [<xref rid=""B23-biomedicines-12-01986"" ref-type=""bibr"">23</xref>,<xref rid=""B24-biomedicines-12-01986"" ref-type=""bibr"">24</xref>,<xref rid=""B25-biomedicines-12-01986"" ref-type=""bibr"">25</xref>]. However, these cells may be remnants surviving after the initial CAP-triggered cell death, which was particularly evident after the 48 h threshold when assessing cell viability. Therefore, the observed reduction in cell proliferation could be attributed to a combination of induced cell death and cell cycle arrest, particularly in the MPNST cell line. This observation suggests the need for multiple consecutive CAP treatments to efficiently target cycling tumor cells in NF1-associated MPNSTs, but may not be necessary for NF1-associated PNs. Interestingly, we noted that <italic toggle=""yes"">NF1</italic>-mutated cells were more sensitive to CAP-induced apoptosis than in the <italic toggle=""yes"">NF1</italic>-WT genetic background, and further work will need to assess the therapeutic window of CAP to avoid secondary toxicity, especially as our cell viability results demonstrated dose–response cellular death. Previous studies have targeted the generation of ROS in NF1-associated MPNSTs, but clinical trials have thus far not proven to be successful, likely due to therapeutic bioavailability [<xref rid=""B26-biomedicines-12-01986"" ref-type=""bibr"">26</xref>,<xref rid=""B27-biomedicines-12-01986"" ref-type=""bibr"">27</xref>]. The potential clinical applications of CAP are multifold, where it can be used as an adjunctive treatment to existing modalities and promote cancer cell death. Because NF1-associated PNSTs are heterogeneous, determining the appropriate dosage and frequency of CAP will likely need to be personalized. For NF1-associated MPNSTs, our results demonstrate that Caspase 3, which is part of the extrinsic apoptotic pathway, is cleaved in the CAP-mediated in vivo setting [<xref rid=""B28-biomedicines-12-01986"" ref-type=""bibr"">28</xref>]. To determine the mechanism of apoptotic cell death, we examined the cell cycle and found that CAP-mediated apoptotic cell death was more prominent in cells arrested in the G1 phase [<xref rid=""B29-biomedicines-12-01986"" ref-type=""bibr"">29</xref>,<xref rid=""B30-biomedicines-12-01986"" ref-type=""bibr"">30</xref>,<xref rid=""B31-biomedicines-12-01986"" ref-type=""bibr"">31</xref>]. To that end, other groups have also demonstrated that CAP induces cell cycle arrest, pointing to CAP’s role in cell cycle mediation as a mechanism of cancer cell death [<xref rid=""B32-biomedicines-12-01986"" ref-type=""bibr"">32</xref>,<xref rid=""B33-biomedicines-12-01986"" ref-type=""bibr"">33</xref>,<xref rid=""B34-biomedicines-12-01986"" ref-type=""bibr"">34</xref>]. Therefore, future studies could examine the synergistic role of current anti-cancer therapies and CAP in enhancing cancer cytotoxicity.  Interestingly, we found that <italic toggle=""yes"">NF1-</italic>mutated cells were more sensitive to CAP-induced apoptosis in comparison to the wild type cells, including the human <italic toggle=""yes"">NF1</italic>-heterozygous Schwann cell line. <italic toggle=""yes"">NF1</italic> genetic mutations induce a hyperactive RAS/MEK/ERK pathway, which has led to the approval of selumetinib, a MEK inhibitor, for NF1-associated plexiform neurofibromas [<xref rid=""B35-biomedicines-12-01986"" ref-type=""bibr"">35</xref>]. With the understanding that the MEK/ERK pathway can potentially be pro-apoptotic, there may be a lower threshold for apoptosis in <italic toggle=""yes"">NF1</italic>-mutated cells, although <italic toggle=""yes"">NF1</italic>-heterozygous cells do not have a hyperactive RAS/MEK/ERK pathway [<xref rid=""B36-biomedicines-12-01986"" ref-type=""bibr"">36</xref>]. However, other groups have shown that CAP downregulates the MEK/ERK pathway to induce apoptosis [<xref rid=""B37-biomedicines-12-01986"" ref-type=""bibr"">37</xref>,<xref rid=""B38-biomedicines-12-01986"" ref-type=""bibr"">38</xref>]. Further studies are necessary to clarify the role of <italic toggle=""yes"">NF1</italic> mutations in CAP-induced apoptosis to refine the parameters of CAP treatment and its effect within different <italic toggle=""yes"">NF1</italic> gene mutation contexts.  From an engineering standpoint, a translational hurdle to overcome is the ability to effectively monitor and regulate exposure that may affect the operation of CAP as well as determining the consistency and effectiveness of treatments in real time [<xref rid=""B39-biomedicines-12-01986"" ref-type=""bibr"">39</xref>,<xref rid=""B40-biomedicines-12-01986"" ref-type=""bibr"">40</xref>]. Several groups have attempted to introduce methods for feedback control and predictive modeling for CAP treatments to compensate for this variability [<xref rid=""B41-biomedicines-12-01986"" ref-type=""bibr"">41</xref>]. As CAP is used in a large variety of applications, developing a control system that works across all fields has proven to be challenging. In addition, RONS are reactive, making these CAP-associated products difficult to detect in real time effectively and determine potential downstream mechanisms. In our studies, we utilized two experimentally established parameters for CAP treatment by using a CAP jet and helium as the carrier gas; however, further work is needed to develop standardized protocols that effectively translate this tool for widespread use in clinical settings [<xref rid=""B42-biomedicines-12-01986"" ref-type=""bibr"">42</xref>,<xref rid=""B43-biomedicines-12-01986"" ref-type=""bibr"">43</xref>]. Other limitations for CAP are the depth of delivery and dosage frequency for tumor treatment. Like the other groups’ findings, there was no significant difference in dCAP versus iCAP in the in vitro setting in NF1-associated tumors [<xref rid=""B44-biomedicines-12-01986"" ref-type=""bibr"">44</xref>]. However, it is well known that dCAP can only induce apoptosis superficially due to penetration depth; our group has previously shown the use of a microneedle patch to address this constraint in the context of a melanoma [<xref rid=""B45-biomedicines-12-01986"" ref-type=""bibr"">45</xref>,<xref rid=""B46-biomedicines-12-01986"" ref-type=""bibr"">46</xref>]. In this study, we delivered PCM intratumorally and achieved anti-tumor effects in the in vivo setting. Although the difference in volume was not statistically significant until Day 27, one tumor in the control group was smaller, which may have affected the average volume in the control group. Nevertheless, given the efficacy of CAP in the in vitro setting, outstanding questions remain in uniformly delivering CAP in the context of individual clinical situations and determining PCM efficacy, as there is an inherent delay between CAP exposure and delivery [<xref rid=""B47-biomedicines-12-01986"" ref-type=""bibr"">47</xref>]. Strategies to address these questions could include device development, such as laser interstitial thermal therapy (LITT) used for deep-seated intracranial lesions and CAP-containing nanoparticles. To our knowledge, we are the first to demonstrate CAP as a potential treatment modality for NF1-associated PNSTs, and our findings are consistent with the findings of others that identify RONS-induced apoptosis as the mechanism by which CAP exerts its anti-cancer effects through the Caspase 3 pathway. This in vitro observation is supported by Ki67 attenuation in an established NF1-associated MPNST xenograft mouse model. One proposed mechanism by which cell death occurs upon CAP exposure is DNA damage leading to cell cycle arrest. Ultimately, this study offers evidence suggesting that CAP exposure could present a new therapeutic avenue for NF1-associated PNSTs, potentially complementing existing treatment modalities.",N/A,02 9 2024

The impact of cutaneous neurofibromas on quality of life and mental health in neurofibromatosis type 1,"The skin manifestations of neurofibromatosis 1 significantly reduce health‐related quality‐of‐life. However, data on the utility of existing surveys in capturing neurofibromatosis 1 skin treatment outcomes are lacking. This quantitative study examined the relationship between clinician‐rated severity and visibility and patient‐rated itch and quality‐of‐life (QoL) to (1) establish baseline levels of skin‐ and condition‐specific‐related QoL, itch, depression and anxiety; (2) identify patient concerns to inform the development and evaluation of skin interventions; and (3) compare the sensitivity of different QoL measures. Validated scales included Skindex‐29, Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI), Neurofibromatosis 1‐adult quality‐of‐life (NF1‐AdQOL) questionnaire, and the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS). We recruited 100 participants (response rate: 95%). Of these, 42% reported itch and 23% had probable clinical anxiety. Our cohort had higher levels of anxiety and total HADS scores compared to a control population. Using multivariate regression analysis, increasing visibility significantly predicted poorer QoL using the Skindex‐29, NF1‐AdQOL, and DLQI (<italic toggle=""no"">p</italic> < 0.05); and itch significantly predicted worse QoL in Skindex‐29 and NF1‐AdQOL (<italic toggle=""no"">p</italic> < 0.05). The highest mean scoring questions in Skindex‐29 and NF1‐AdQOL concerned worry about worsening skin disease and embarrassment. The highest mean scoring questions in DLQI were regarding itch, pain, and embarrassment. Items asking specifically about cutaneous neurofibromas (cNF) scored higher than comparable skin‐specific questions (<italic toggle=""no"">t</italic>‐test <italic toggle=""no"">p</italic> value <0.05). In summary, this study provides insights into the factors contributing to impaired QoL, anxiety, and mood in NF1 patients with cutaneous neurofibromas. Key factors identified for use in cNF measures include visibility, itch, anxiety, embarrassment, fears of worsening skin disease, and cNF‐specific questions.","Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1 OMIM:162200), is a progressive, autosomal dominant tumor predisposition disorder.<xref rid=""jde17276-bib-0001"" ref-type=""bibr"">

</xref> Therefore, it is important to identify the best skin‐, NF1‐ or cNF‐related Qol items to be used to assess cNF treatment outcomes. The primary aim of this study was to establish baseline levels of skin‐ and NF1‐related QoL, itch, depression, and anxiety in patients with NF1 presenting for treatment for cNFs at an NF1 skin clinic using a variety of commonly used QoL measures. A secondary aim was to identify important patient concerns to inform the development and evaluation of skin interventions for individuals with NF1. Third, we sought to compare the sensitivity of different validated scales to patient concerns and clinical factors, to inform the utility of existing survey tools in NF1. A cross‐sectional cohort study examined the health and QoL of adults with NF1 attending a clinical genetics and dermatology clinic in Australia. Laser treatments and surgical excisions of primarily cNFs are performed at this clinic. This research was approved by the Northern Sydney Local Health District Ethics Committee (reference 2019/ETH08177). All participants provided written informed consent. After excluding two patients because of significant language barriers, 105 patients were invited to participate in the study. A total of 100 patients completed the surveys, a 95% response rate. Because of cognitive difficulties, two patients received help from family members to complete the surveys. The mean (standard deviation) age of participants was 42.9 (SD 13.0) years; range, 18–78 years and 68% were female (Table <xref rid=""jde17276-tbl-0001"" ref-type=""table"">1</xref>).

 Itch was an important predictor of worsening Skindex‐29 and NF1‐related QoL scores.

 Measures of cNF disease burden are paramount to the design of cNF treatment measures. In this study, the burden of cNFs was determined in three different ways: clinician‐rated visibility using the Ablon scale, clinician‐estimated number of cNFs, and presence or absence of facial cNFs. The Ablon visibility score and clinician‐estimated number of cNFs correlated strongly (Table <xref rid=""jde17276-supitem-0001"" ref-type=""supplementary-material"">S1</xref>), and we found them to have comparable impacts on QoL scores. Interestingly, the presence of facial neurofibromas did not predict worsening QoL scores in any measure. After controlling for confounders (age, gender and itch), the Ablon score was an important predictor of reduced skin‐related and overall QoL, similar to previous studies.<xref rid=""jde17276-bib-0002"" ref-type=""bibr"">

</xref> is an essential and powerful tool for use in future studies. While not cNF‐specific, the brevity of DLQI and the fact it has been extensively used and was sensitive to visibility changes while not impacted by gender, age or itch, makes it a measure with key strengths relevant to cNF trials. Despite a national referral base, this research was undertaken in a single, tertiary hospital with a predominance of female patients. Patient‐rated disease visibility was not collected and may better reflect the patient experience and more accurately capture impact of skin disease and treatment on patient's QoL and mental health.

 Disease visibility and itch are associated with poorer skin‐ and NF1‐related QoL in individuals seeking cNF treatment and are, therefore, important to address clinically. We show the large emotional impact of cNF appearance, which highlights the value of patient reported QoL measures evaluating the impact of the emotional burden of the disease and the need for both patient and clinician ratings of visibility in the evaluation of skin treatments. We found higher levels of likely clinical anxiety than previously reported,<xref rid=""jde17276-bib-0006"" ref-type=""bibr"">

Outcome measures used in cNF therapeutic trials and further research should include evaluation of visibility, patient‐reported QoL, itch, and anxiety. This work creates a foundation for further research into the sensitivity of individual survey items to detect meaningful treatment outcomes for individuals with bothersome cNFs. None declared.

Spontaneous Tension Hemothorax in a Patient With Neurofibromatosis Type 1,"Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1), also known as von Recklinghausen disease, is the most common phacomatosis. It is characterized by neurofibromas but also manifests vascular complications including stenosis, arterial ectasia, and aneurysms. We report the case of an otherwise healthy 45-year-old male who developed a fatal tension hemothorax due to bleeding from the left costocervical artery. Tension hemothorax without trauma is rare except in cases with a rupture of an aortic aneurysm; we successfully treated the patient by promptly diagnosing tension hemothorax and performing chest drainage, as well as timely transcatheter arterial embolization (TAE) to control bleeding. When encountering shock patients with NF1, clinicians should be mindful of the potential for non-traumatic hemorrhagic complications due to vascular malformation.","Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1), the most common phacomatosis, was first described by von Recklinghausen in 1882 [<xref rid=""REF1"" ref-type=""bibr"">1</xref>]. NF1 is characterized by neurofibromas but also manifests other organ lesions such as musculoskeletal abnormalities, skin disorders, and vascular disorders [<xref rid=""REF2"" ref-type=""bibr"">2</xref>]. Vascular lesions are less well-documented in NF1, with reports indicating that they occur in only 1-3% of cases [<xref rid=""REF3"" ref-type=""bibr"">3</xref>]. They can present in various ways, including stenosis, aneurysm formation, arteriovenous fistula, vascular proliferation, and invasion, or compression by neural tumors. One of the symptoms of NF1 vascular disorders is spontaneous haemothorax, which is one of the more severe manifestations of NF1, with a low incidence and the potential for fatal outcomes [<xref rid=""REF4"" ref-type=""bibr"">4</xref>]. While spontaneous hemothorax does not involve a traumatic mechanism, it can lead to tension hemothorax in some cases, and there have been reports of fatalities associated with this condition [<xref rid=""REF5"" ref-type=""bibr"">5</xref>]. We discuss a case of a patient with NF1 admitted for spontaneous tension hemothorax. A 45-year-old male with a history of NF1 presented to the emergency department with sudden-onset dyspnea. He had been in his usual state of health until three days before the presentation when he noticed discomfort in his left shoulder. He had a history of NF1 and had been followed up as an outpatient at another hospital. He had no history of trauma and was neither on anticoagulant nor antiplatelet therapy. At his admission to the emergency department, he was hemodynamically unstable and in respiratory distress. His vital signs were as follows: respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute, a heart rate of 130 beats per minute, a blood pressure of 54/28 mmHg, a body temperature of 35 °C, and oxygen saturation level of 95% on O<sub>2</sub> 10L. Physical examination revealed absent breathing sound of the left lung and jugular vein distension. Laboratory evaluation revealed white blood cell counts (WBCs) of 13,600/mm<sup>3</sup>, hemoglobin of 12.2 g/dl, red blood cell counts (RBCs) of 4.08 × 10<sup>6</sup>/mm<sup>3</sup>, platelet counts of 185 × 10<sup>3</sup>/mm<sup>3</sup>, creatinine of 1.4 mg/dl, prothrombin time of 12.9 seconds (reference range: 9.8-12.1 seconds), and activated partial thromboplastin time of 21.6 seconds (reference range: 23.5-31.5 seconds) (Table <xref rid=""TAB1"" ref-type=""table"">1</xref>). Chest X-rays showed total opacification of the left thorax, accompanied by a mediastinal shift toward the right (Figure <xref rid=""FIG1"" ref-type=""fig"">1</xref>). As the patient’s blood pressure was unresponsive to fluid administration and noradrenalin, intubation and thoracic cavity drainage were performed. After draining 1,500 milliliters of hemorrhagic pleural effusion by a chest tube insertion into the left thorax, his blood pressure recovered to 110/50 mmHg. After hemodynamics were stabilized, contrast-enhanced CT (CECT) was performed, which revealed massive hemothorax on the left chest cavity with extravasation in hematoma on the pulmonary apex region (Figure <xref rid=""FIG2"" ref-type=""fig"">2</xref>). Transcatheter arterial embolization (TAE) using the micro-coaxial catheter technique was performed after a transfusion of six units of RBC and six units of fresh-frozen plasma (FFP). Angiography of the left subclavian artery revealed a pseudoaneurysm in the left costocervical artery, which was embolized using n-butyl-2-cyanoacrylate (Figure <xref rid=""FIG3"" ref-type=""fig"">3</xref>). TAE improved the patient's hypotension and anemia, and he was extubated three days after admission. The chest tube was removed six days after admission. The patient was fully recovered and discharged after eight days of hospitalization. NF1, first described by von Recklinghausen in 1882, is the most common phacomatosis [<xref rid=""REF1"" ref-type=""bibr"">1</xref>]. The incidence of NF1 is estimated to be 1:2600 to 1:3000 individuals. Around 50% of the cases are inherited [<xref rid=""REF6"" ref-type=""bibr"">6</xref>]. The genes responsible for NF1 are pathogenic variants in the NF1 gene, which is located on chromosome 17q11.2 [<xref rid=""REF7"" ref-type=""bibr"">7</xref>]. Clinically, NF1 is typically characterized by café-au-lait macules, axillary and/or inguinal freckling, Lisch nodules, and neurofibromas. Vascular lesions are less common in NF1 (1-3% of cases) [<xref rid=""REF3"" ref-type=""bibr"">3</xref>]. Vascular lesions reported include arterial stenosis, aneurysms, spontaneous arterial rupture, and arteriovenous fistulae. Several mechanisms have been proposed regarding the pathogenesis of vascular lesions in patients with NF1. It is believed that large vessels are directly infiltrated by neighboring tumors, such as schwannomas, leading to intimal proliferation, media thinning, and fragmentation of elastic tissue. These changes can result in stenosis or the formation of aneurysms. It is believed that smaller vessels exhibit wall dysplasia characterized by fibro-hyaline thickening of the intima and muscularis, leading to stenosis and a consequent marked weakening of the arterial wall [<xref rid=""REF8"" ref-type=""bibr"">8</xref>]. Reports of massive hemothorax in NF1 patients are rare. Spontaneous hemothorax, a rare but often fatal complication of NF1, may arise from the bleeding of dysplastic small vessels or the rupture of an aneurysm in a major intrathoracic artery. The mortality rate for such events is reported to be up to 36%, and the operative mortality rate is reported to be 33% [<xref rid=""REF4"" ref-type=""bibr"">4</xref>]. It is noteworthy that this case involved not only massive hemothorax but also tension hemothorax. A tension hemothorax is a serious condition that can cause obstructive shock and, if not treated promptly, can result in cardiac arrest. This report involves the second case of a tension-type hemothorax due to NF1, following the report by Bidad et al. [<xref rid=""REF5"" ref-type=""bibr"">5</xref>]. We believe that our patient's survival was aided significantly by the prompt diagnosis of tension hemothorax and chest drainage, which prevented cardiac arrest, and timely TAE to control bleeding. In the case of an NF1 patient who is in shock, it is important to consider the possibility of non-traumatic hemorrhagic complications due to vascular malformations, as this enables a rapid response to a potentially fatal condition. Spontaneous hemothorax is an extremely rare but potentially life-threatening complication in patients with NF1 and should be taken seriously during the management of NF1 patients. The prompt diagnosis of tension hemothorax and chest drainage and timely TAE to control bleeding can save these patients. All ER physicians should be aware that in patients with NF1 who are in shock, there is a potential for non-traumatic hemorrhagic complications due to vascular malformation.",N/A,14 10 2024
Duodenal ampulla neuroendocrine tumor and gastrointestinal stromal tumors in a case of neurofibromatosis type 1: a case report,"Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF-1) is commonly associated with a variety of rare tumors. However, no case of multiple gastric gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GISTs) or duodenal ampulla neuroendocrine tumors (NETs) with multiple liver metastases in a patient with NF-1 has yet been reported. Here, we describe a case of a 55-year-old female patient with NF-1 whose serum Pro-Gastrin-Releasing Peptide (pro-GRP) levels were elevated. Gastrointestinal endoscopy and biopsy showed duodenal papilla space-occupying mass, and the pathological diagnosis turned out to be neuroendocrine tumors (NETs). During surgical exploration, multiple tumors were found on the serosal surface of the stomach and numerous miliary metastases in the liver. Following histopathological examination, it was determined that the liver metastases were NF-1 and the tumors in the gastric wall were GISTs. The patient benefited from targeted therapy and had an uneventful hospital stay. In this case, we emphasize treating patients with neurofibromatosis type 1 who exhibit abdominal symptoms with a high degree of clinical suspicion and performing thorough evaluations to rule out multiple tumors.","Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF-1) is an autosomal dominant neurocutaneous disorder with a prevalence of 1 per 4,000 individuals, which arises as a result of <italic toggle=""yes"">NF1</italic> gene mutation, located on chromosome 17q11.2 (<xref rid=""B1"" ref-type=""bibr"">1</xref>). NF-1 increases the risk of malignancy and decreases life expectancy, in addition to being associated with a broad range of clinical presentations. Café-au-lait spots and peripheral neurofibromas are commonly observed (<xref rid=""B2"" ref-type=""bibr"">2</xref>). Previous studies have reported that <italic toggle=""yes"">NF1</italic> gene mutation can lead to Ras pathway abnormalities, which may also result in peripheral neurilemmomas, central nervous system tumors, stromal tumors, neuroendocrine tumors, and other benign and malignant tumors. Gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GISTs) are intestinal stromal tumors originating from the interstitial cells of Cajal, which are found in the intestine. GISTs are relatively common, with prevalences estimated to vary from 5% to 30% in patients with NF-1, usually affecting elderly individuals with a median age of approximately 60–65 years (<xref rid=""B3"" ref-type=""bibr"">3</xref>). GISTs can develop anywhere in the gastrointestinal tract. The stomach accounts for approximately 60% of all cases, while the duodenum and rectum account for only approximately 5% (<xref rid=""B4"" ref-type=""bibr"">4</xref>). However, in the case of NF-1, approximately 90% of GISTs are found in the small intestine, while only 5.4% are located in the stomach (<xref rid=""B5"" ref-type=""bibr"">5</xref>). NETs arise from the endocrine cells of the gastrointestinal tract, which are enterochromaffin cells derived from the crypts of Lieberkühn in the mucosa and submucosa (<xref rid=""B6"" ref-type=""bibr"">6</xref>). NETs typically originate in the gastroenteropancreatic system. Duodenal ampulla NETs are extremely uncommon, with an incidence of <1% (<xref rid=""B7"" ref-type=""bibr"">7</xref>). We report an extremely rare case of multiple gastric GISTs and duodenal ampulla NETs, along with multiple liver metastases, in a patient with NF-1. While instances of these tumor types have been documented in individuals with NF-1, the coexistence of both NETs on the duodenal ampulla and GISTs in the stomach is exceedingly uncommon. A 55-year-old female patient with NF-1 presented to our hospital due to a suspected space-occupying lesion in the ampulla. The presence of café-au-lait spots on the body and limbs, multiple neurofibromas over the trunk and face, her <italic toggle=""yes"">NF1</italic> gene mutation, and family history of NF-1 in a first-degree relative (sister) confirmed the diagnosis of NF-1. The patient denied nausea, emesis, chest pain, shortness of breath, syncope, or other symptoms at the time. Physical examination revealed generalized icterus, but no palpable abdominal lump was detected and Murphy’s sign was negative. Initial laboratory analysis of this patient showed high levels of total bilirubin (TBIL), 28.4 µmol/L; direct bilirubin (DBIL),19.1 µmol/L; ALT, 226 µmol/L; AST, 229 µmol/L; ALP, 610 µmol/L; GGT, 933 µmol/L; blood ammonia, 76.5 µmol/L; and pro-GRP, 334 pg/mL. Gastrointestinal endoscopy and biopsy revealed the presence of a duodenal papilla that occupied space and exhibited depression and erosion at the raised opening. Pathological diagnosis confirmed the presence of NETs (G1) (<xref rid=""f1"" ref-type=""fig"">
<bold>Figure 1</bold>
</xref>). Computed tomography (CT) of the abdomen with contrast revealed several lesions in the duodenal ampulla area, along with dilation of both intrahepatic and extrahepatic bile ducts and pancreatic ducts (<xref rid=""f2"" ref-type=""fig"">
<bold>Figure 2A</bold>
</xref>). Additionally, numerous calcifications were detected in the liver. The diagnosis of NF-1 was further confirmed by the presence of soft tissue nodules and mass shadows on the skin and subcutaneous areas of the head, neck, and chest. The results of nuclear magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) indicated an abnormal signal in the pancreatic head region, which suggested a diagnosis of NETs (<xref rid=""f2"" ref-type=""fig"">
<bold>Figure 2B</bold>

<bold>Figure 2C</bold>
</xref>). The patient was clinically diagnosed with GISTs and NETs in NF-1. The patient underwent laparoscopic pancreatoduodenectomy after providing written informed consent. During the exploratory operation, we discovered several tumors on the serosal surface of the stomach and multiple miliary metastases (0.5–0.8 cm) in the liver (<xref rid=""f2"" ref-type=""fig"">
<bold>Figure 2D</bold>
</xref>). Two liver lesions and one gastric wall tumor were surgically excised to obtain a pathological diagnosis. Histopathological examinations revealed that the liver metastases were composed of NETs with a Ki67 value of 1%, indicating a low grade (<xref rid=""f3"" ref-type=""fig"">
<bold>Figure 3</bold>
</xref>). The tumors observed in the gastric wall were identified as GISTs (<xref rid=""f4"" ref-type=""fig"">
<bold>Figure 4</bold>
</xref>). Surgical resection could not be performed due to the presence of multiple developed metastatic tumors. The patient was transferred to the internal medicine department for treatment. Blood tests showed high levels of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) (215.0 pg/mL) and pro-GRP (334.9 pg/mL). The patient underwent targeted therapy with 300 mg of surufatinib daily and symptomatic treatment based on the results of the examination and the patient’s condition. GISTs are predominant mesenchymal tumors observed in individuals with NF-1. Individuals with NF-1 are more likely to develop GISTs (7%) than the general population. It mostly occurs in the small intestine (<xref rid=""B8"" ref-type=""bibr"">8</xref>). However, our case involved GISTs localized to the stomach with multiple lesions. Ampullary NETs are reported to be exceedingly rare, with an incidence <0.05% among GI NETs (<xref rid=""B9"" ref-type=""bibr"">9</xref>). Approximately 26% of NETs are associated with neurofibromatosis (<xref rid=""B10"" ref-type=""bibr"">10</xref>). Although both NETs and GISTs are uncommon tumors, their coexistence is even rarer, with only two reported cases (<xref rid=""B11"" ref-type=""bibr"">11</xref>, <xref rid=""B12"" ref-type=""bibr"">12</xref>). These clinical entities should be considered when patients are diagnosed with NF-1. Ampullary NETs have a higher tendency to exhibit high-grade tumors and lymph node metastases (<xref rid=""B7"" ref-type=""bibr"">7</xref>). Jaundice (65%) and pain (31%) are the most frequently reported symptoms (<xref rid=""B13"" ref-type=""bibr"">13</xref>). Our finding of gastrinoma contrasts with the most prevalent type of peri-ampullary NETs observed in patients with NF-1, which is somatostatinoma (40%). Compared to duodenal NETs, ampullary NETs are associated with poorer overall survival rates. Pancreaticoduodenectomy is the recommended therapeutic approach for well-differentiated ampullary carcinoid tumors measuring more than 2 cm and for ampullary neuroendocrine carcinomas (<xref rid=""B14"" ref-type=""bibr"">14</xref>). GISTs in NF-1 usually involve multiple occurrences in the small bowel rather than sporadic GISTs (<xref rid=""B15"" ref-type=""bibr"">15</xref>). Spindle cell morphology is observed in the majority of tumors, along with a lower mitotic rate and Ki67 index, as per histological examination (<xref rid=""B16"" ref-type=""bibr"">16</xref>). Due to their resistance to imatinib mesylate therapy caused by the absence of c-kit mutations, surgical intervention remains the sole curative treatment option (<xref rid=""B17"" ref-type=""bibr"">17</xref>). In this study, we presented a unique case of gastric GISTs associated with NF-1. The patient underwent imatinib mesylate therapy followed by surgical intervention. Currently, there are no screening guidelines for gastrointestinal tumors in patients with NF-1, and surgery is the preferred treatment for GISTs and NETs in NF-1. However, if surgical treatment is not administered, the treatment options become significantly limited. Gastrointestinal manifestations in individuals with NF-1 typically occur in middle-aged and older individuals. GISTs and NETs in NF-1 are usually asymptomatic in the initial stages, often diagnosed at an advanced cancer stage; thus, patients miss the chance for surgical intervention. In the present work, the patient exhibited multiple tumors, including GISTs and NETs. She was initially asymptomatic and therefore missed the optimal treatment window, leading to an unfavorable prognosis. Considering the potential concealment and elevated risk of tumor development resulting from genetic abnormalities, we recommend conducting regular examinations on elderly patients even in the absence of adequate clinical evidence supporting this screening practice. Contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), along with the presence of other potential diagnostic tumor biomarkers, are highly sensitive diagnostic modalities. Despite the general rarity of these tumors, it is crucial to maintain a high level of suspicion and ensure early diagnosis in asymptomatic patients with NF-1. Furthermore, our case highlights one challenge inherent in the diagnosis of gastrointestinal tumors associated with NF-1. Proper diagnosis of abdominal manifestations of NF-1 is essential to finding appropriate treatment and preventing severe organic complications associated with tumor masses. The definitive diagnosis of GISTs or NETs is typically confirmed through immunohistochemistry following a tissue biopsy. Due to the potential development of various rare tumors in NF-1, obtaining biopsies from multiple locations is recommended for definitive histopathological diagnosis. In this study, it was found that during the early stages, GISTs and NETs in patients with NF-1 often remain asymptomatic but tended to have already metastasized by the time patients sought treatment. Despite the lack of current screening guidelines for gastrointestinal tumors in patients with NF-1, early diagnosis and management play a crucial role in reducing both mortality and morbidity. While the definitive diagnosis of GISTs or NETs is typically confirmed through immunohistochemistry after a tissue biopsy, it is advisable to obtain biopsies from multiple locations to achieve a conclusive histopathological diagnosis.",N/A,30 9 2024
Recurrence of spinal schwannomas in a patient with neurofibromatosis type 1: a case report,,"Schwannomas are benign, well-circumscribed tumors usually attached to peripheral nerves, consisting of a clonal population of Schwann cells<sup><xref rid=""R1"" ref-type=""bibr"">1</xref></sup>. Spinal schwannomas account for about 25% of primary intradural spinal cord tumors in adults<sup><xref rid=""R2"" ref-type=""bibr"">2</xref></sup>. In the vast majority of cases, schwannomas are solitary and sporadic, while multiple schwannomas are associated with neurofibromatosis type 2 (NF2) and schwannomatosis. Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) is an autosomal dominant neurocutaneous disorder that predominantly affects the skin, bone and nervous system. NF1 is distinct on clinical and genetic grounds from neurofibromatosis type 2, a rare disorder characterized by bilateral vestibular schwannomas and other benign nervous system tumors<sup><xref rid=""R3"" ref-type=""bibr"">3</xref></sup>. The gold standard treatment for symptomatic spinal schwannomas is complete surgical resection, which stops symptoms progression, helps recovery in most patients, and decreases the rate of recurrence. Radiotherapy can be considered as second-choice treatment in patients who are not good candidates for surgery, or for recurrent tumors<sup><xref rid=""R4"" ref-type=""bibr"">4</xref></sup>. The recurrence rate for spinal schwannomas ranges from 4.08 to 9.4% and depends on size, extent of tumor and genetic associations rather than the location of the tumor<sup><xref rid=""R5"" ref-type=""bibr"">5</xref>,<xref rid=""R6"" ref-type=""bibr"">6</xref></sup>. This case has been reported in line with the SCARE 2023 criteria<sup><xref rid=""R7"" ref-type=""bibr"">7</xref></sup>. A 50-year-old female presented to OPD with complains of back pain and weakness of lower limbs for 3 months. The pain was insidious in onset, gradually progressing and later radiating to bilateral lower limbs. It was associated with weakness of lower limbs in the form of difficulty in walking and inability to stand for prolonged periods of time that had increased to the extent that she had been unable to walk without support. She had urge incontinence as she could not control her bladder and bowel once she had sensation. There is also a past history of being operated 1 year back after she was diagnosed with spinal schwannoma; she had undergone laminectomy with total resection for the spinal schwannoma extending from L5–S1. On examination, there was skin patch over her left hand measuring 2 cm, axillary freckling along with multiple fibromas over her back; suggestive of NF type 1. Genetic studies were not performed. The diagnostic criteria utilized to make a diagnosis is NIH criteria for neurofibromatosis 1<sup><xref rid=""R8"" ref-type=""bibr"">8</xref></sup>. Her higher mental function was intact, cranial nerves were intact. There was no motor or sensory deficit over both upper limbs. The power of the right lower and left lower limb were 3/5 and 4/5, respectively. There was sensory impairment of all modalities below the hip region (right >>left). Her recent MRI revealed a single right-sided intradural extramedullary, homogenously enhancing, well-marginated mass at D9 level (Fig. <xref rid=""F1"" ref-type=""fig"">1</xref>). Other laboratory parameters were within normal range. She underwent bilateral laminectomies of D9, following the durotomy. A well-defined solid yellowish lesion was visualized adjacent to the D9 vertebrae; it was then completely resected (Fig. <xref rid=""F2"" ref-type=""fig"">2</xref>). Neuromonitoring potentials remained unchanged. The tumor was sent for histopathology and was later confirmed as benign spinal schwannoma. The patient recovered postoperatively with a gradual increase in the strength of lower limbs and was discharged on 3rd postoperative day. Recurrence is defined as reappearance after definite surgical excision or symptomatic increase in size of a residual tumor on follow-up imaging studies. Local recurrence means reappearance in the same place as the original tumor or very close to it. Regional recurrence means reappearance into lymph nodes or tissues near the original tumor. Distant recurrence means reappearance in organs or tissues far from the original tumor<sup><xref rid=""R9"" ref-type=""bibr"">9</xref></sup>. Spinal schwannoma is a solid, encapsulated, mostly benign and intradural-extramedullary tumor. They may occur spontaneously, or in the context of a familial tumor syndrome such as NF2, schwannomatosis and Carney’s complex<sup><xref rid=""R1"" ref-type=""bibr"">1</xref></sup>. However, the occurrence of spinal schwannomas in neurofibromatosis type 1 is not well established and such phenomenon is rare finding in itself. But as in other causes of spinal schwannomas, gross total resection (GTR) with preservation of neurological functions is the best treatment to relieve patients’ complaints and to reduce the recurrence rate<sup><xref rid=""R6"" ref-type=""bibr"">6</xref></sup>. Analyzing our case, the patient developed spinal schwannomas at two different locations at different periods of time and at both instances, she underwent laminectomy with removal of schwannoma with good postoperative recovery. Recurrence is common in schwannoma if the residual tumor is left during excision but at the same site of the initial lesion<sup><xref rid=""R10"" ref-type=""bibr"">10</xref></sup>. There should be high degree of suspicion to consider the recurrence of spinal schwannoma, especially if the patient has been previously operated for the same condition. Chordomas, Giant cell tumors, Meningioma and Chondroblastoma are part of the differential diagnoses for spinal schwannomas, and each should be carefully excluded to reach a diagnosis of spinal schwannoma. Laboratory tests combined with MRI have a good sensitivity and specificity for spinal schwannoma. Laminectomy has normally been used as a standard approach for intradural spinal tumors but this procedure is associated with spinal instability and deformity. Laminoplasty was developed to overcome these complications<sup><xref rid=""R11"" ref-type=""bibr"">11</xref></sup>. However, studies have not demonstrated laminoplasty to have any better functional outcome compared to laminectomy in the resection of intradural lesions<sup><xref rid=""R12"" ref-type=""bibr"">12</xref>,<xref rid=""R13"" ref-type=""bibr"">13</xref></sup>. Since schwannoma is a slow-growing, benign neoplasm, the expected interval between two episodes can be years but the patient developed two different neoplasms within a period of 1 year; the cause of which cannot be linked to other than neurofibromatosis type 1. The neurofibromatosis type 1 is typically associated with the occurrence of plexiform neurofibromas and less commonly central nervous system gliomas<sup><xref rid=""R14"" ref-type=""bibr"">14</xref></sup>. There is no literature describing the recurrence of spinal schwannomas in neurofibromatosis type 1. Thereby, the spinal schwannoma is a rare occurrence in neurofibromatosis type 1 and needs further study to establish a link between these two entities. Thus, although there is well-established association between spinal schwannomas and neurofibromatosis type 2; the diagnosis should be considered in a patient with neurofibromatosis type 1 whenever the patient develops symptoms or the symptoms worsens followed by proper investigation to identify/ rule out the diagnosis. The occurrence of spinal schwannomas in a patient with neurofibromatosis type 1 is a rare phenomenon and in the absence of well-established association between spinal schwannoma and neurofibromatosis type 1, it becomes difficult for clinicians to consider the diagnosis especially when there is recurrence following the initial surgery. Thus, further study is needed between neurofibromatosis type 1 and spinal schwannomas to establish an association between them so that it would help clinicians to consider the diagnosis when the patient presents with such symptoms.

Malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumour presenting as pathological fracture of proximal femur in neurofibromatosis type-1: a case report with brief literature search,"Neurofibromas, in association with NF-1, can undergo a malignant transformation, giving rise to Malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumours (MPNSTs), a relatively rare entity. Clinically, it presents with non-specific symptoms like pain and numbness, distinguishing it from other nerve lesions difficult. There is a lack of data on the occurrence of MPNST in NF-1 in children and adults, and distant metastasis to the brain and bones is reported only in a few cases. In this case report, we present the unusual presentation of MPNST with metastasis to the proximal femur and liver in a patient with NF-1 and its management. Patients and clinicians should be made aware of the relatively high risk of MPNST in NF-1, which is characterized by pain and rapid growth, and regular follow-up is needed for NF-1 patients for early diagnosis of malignant transformation. So, this case report is presented to enhance the understanding and awareness regarding this rare presentation.",Full text not available in PMC,N/A,2024
Consensus recommendations on management of selumetinib-associated adverse events in pediatric patients with neurofibromatosis type 1 and plexiform neurofibromas,,"A modified Delphi approach was used to develop expert-led consensus statements for the prevention and management of AEs (<xref rid=""F2"" ref-type=""fig"">Figure 2A</xref>). The panel of 10 experts refined the statements and rated the extent to which they agreed with them in 2 sessions and a follow-up survey. Unlike a traditional Delphi approach, initial statements were developed based on a literature review of current management recommendations and regulatory reports, in particular recommendations for MEK inhibitor use by Klesse et al. (2020) and the selumetinib Summary of Product Characteristics (SmPC).<sup><xref rid=""CIT0009"" ref-type=""bibr"">9</xref>,<xref rid=""CIT0020"" ref-type=""bibr"">20</xref></sup> Ten experts participated: 2 pediatric neuro-oncologists, 1 pediatric oncologist, 1 pediatrician, 1 neuropediatrician, 1 oncologist, 1 neurologist, 2 psychologists, and 1 dermatologist. Three experts were from Austria, 2 were from Italy, and 1 each was from Germany, France, Spain, Portugal, and the UK. The panel was divided into 2 sessions separated by 1 week. In the first session, experts validated and prioritized the key AEs reported in the initial approved selumetinib label based on their experience and began voting on and revising initial statements on AE management. The second session focused entirely on voting on and revising statements. When referring to the severity of an AE, these are described as per the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) (ie, grade 1, mild; grade 2, moderate; grade 3, severe; grade 4, life-threatening; grade 5, death related to an AE).<sup><xref rid=""CIT0021"" ref-type=""bibr"">21</xref></sup> The experts voted on closed statements using a Likert scale (1–9), whereby 1 indicated they “strongly disagree” with the statement, and 9 indicated they “strongly agree” (<xref rid=""F2"" ref-type=""fig"">Figure 2B</xref>). Consensus was defined as ≥75% of the panel rating their agreement as 7 or higher. In the follow-up survey, the panel voted on modified statements, noted example products to use, and provided additional detail relating to the statements. If they disagreed with the statements, they had an opportunity to elaborate on their rationale for disagreement. In the first session of the panel, the experts reached consensus on the relative observed frequency of AEs potentially associated with selumetinib, and their impact on patients (<xref rid=""F3"" ref-type=""fig"">Figure 3</xref>), based on expert experience and as reported in the SPRINT Phase II trial (Stratum 1), in which AEs were assessed in 50 pediatric patients with symptomatic and inoperable PN.<sup><xref rid=""CIT0011"" ref-type=""bibr"">11</xref></sup> On completion of the follow-up survey, consensus-level agreement had been reached for 36 statements regarding the prevention and management of AEs potentially associated with selumetinib (<xref rid=""T1"" ref-type=""table"">Table 1</xref>). Statements that did not reach consensus-level agreement are shown in <xref rid=""sup1"" ref-type=""supplementary-material"">Supplementary Table 1</xref>. Experts recommended treatments for AEs based on their experience. However, physicians should follow local guidelines and determine availability and accessibility when choosing a particular treatment for their patients, and use should reflect the severity of the AEs, as defined by CTCAE grade.<sup><xref rid=""CIT0021"" ref-type=""bibr"">21</xref></sup> When possible, management of AEs should be conducted using multidisciplinary consultation with relevant specialists. The selumetinib SmPC provides recommendations for dose reduction, interruption, and modification when required for management of AEs, and is considered the primary reference document for clinicians when prescribing selumetinib (<xref rid=""sup1"" ref-type=""supplementary-material"">Supplementary Table 2</xref>). The following sections reflect the recommendations of the expert panel and outline the consensus statements for each of the selected AEs. Specific examples of recommended treatment regimens for each AE (where applicable) are provided in <xref rid=""T1"" ref-type=""table"">Table 1</xref>. A Plain Language Summary can be found in the <xref rid=""sup1"" ref-type=""supplementary-material"">Supplementary Material</xref>. Selumetinib is an oral MEK1/2 inhibitor approved for the treatment of pediatric patients with NF1-PN,<sup><xref rid=""CIT0009"" ref-type=""bibr"">9</xref>,<xref rid=""CIT0010"" ref-type=""bibr"">10</xref></sup> and has demonstrated a clinically meaningful reduction in PN volume, extended progression-free survival, and improved health-related QoL and other patient-reported outcomes.<sup><xref rid=""CIT0011"" ref-type=""bibr"">11</xref></sup> Selumetinib has a manageable safety profile, in line with that of other MEK inhibitors, and associated AEs are mostly mild to moderate, with few patients requiring dose modifications or discontinuation due to AEs.<sup><xref rid=""CIT0011"" ref-type=""bibr"">11</xref></sup> The most common AEs in the SPRINT Phase II trial were nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, asymptomatic CPK elevation, acneiform rash, and paronychia.<sup><xref rid=""CIT0011"" ref-type=""bibr"">11</xref></sup> However, expert recommendations on how to appropriately and effectively prevent and manage AEs during selumetinib treatment are lacking. It is known that by improving tolerability through appropriate AE management, the clinical benefit of a drug can be increased. Here, we used a modified Delphi approach with a multidisciplinary panel to develop consensus statements on the prevention, early detection, and management of AEs that frequently occur during selumetinib treatment, and/or those that have the greatest impact on patients. Although it is important to have recommendations on all AEs that can occur during selumetinib treatment, the panel agreed that particular focus should be given to AEs that, in their experience, have the highest frequency and/or patient impact. When discussing the prioritization of AEs, the panel experts agreed that physicians are typically concerned about high-impact AEs that may lead to discontinuation, whereas patients are likely most concerned about dermatologic AEs, which can affect their appearance and have a social impact. Therefore, it is important to consider these different perspectives when determining an approach to managing and preventing AEs. In the first part of this panel discussion, the experts agreed on the relative frequency and impact of AEs potentially associated with selumetinib. From this, consensus statements and expert recommendations were provided for priority AEs. Dermatologic AEs with MEK inhibitors are well documented,<sup><xref rid=""CIT0014"" ref-type=""bibr"">14</xref>,<xref rid=""CIT0027"" ref-type=""bibr"">27</xref>,<xref rid=""CIT0042"" ref-type=""bibr"">42</xref></sup> and the panel agreed that, because of their frequency and impact on patients, these should be prioritized for selumetinib. The frequency of specific dermatologic AEs was noted to vary by age group, with acneiform rash more commonly seen in adolescents than young children. Of all dermatologic AEs, paronychia was seen as the most challenging to address, with the panel noting that it should be managed aggressively and be a key focus for healthcare practitioners. To prevent dermatologic AEs such as rashes or paronychia, patients should use emollients, practice sun safety, and prevent potential traumas to the hands or feet, for example by avoiding tight shoes. The psychological burden of AEs was also highlighted because it is high in most patients, can be worsened if there are underlying psychological issues, and has the potential to affect treatment compliance, especially in certain age groups. Gastrointestinal AEs were also considered a priority because they are one of the most commonly reported AEs potentially associated with selumetinib, including nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea.<sup><xref rid=""CIT0011"" ref-type=""bibr"">11</xref></sup> As of February 2024, the FDA and EMA approvals state that selumetinib can be taken with or without food because studies have shown that taking selumetinib with a meal has no clinically relevant impact on GI-related AEs.<sup><xref rid=""CIT0009"" ref-type=""bibr"">9</xref></sup> Although GI-related AEs are mostly mild (grade 1 or 2), such symptoms can negatively impact QoL, disrupting school, family, and social activities.<sup><xref rid=""CIT0033"" ref-type=""bibr"">33</xref></sup> Stomatitis was considered an important AE to manage since it can be associated with considerable pain and have a great impact on a patient’s daily life.<sup><xref rid=""CIT0032"" ref-type=""bibr"">32</xref></sup> Alongside strategies including oral healthcare regimens and topical treatments, oral examinations are recommended if the patient shows any symptoms. For nausea and vomiting, it is important for patients to maintain a healthy, low-fat diet. The panel agreed that visual and cardiac AEs have a high burden if encountered. While there may not be any measures to prevent cardiac or visual AEs, patients should try to adhere to the monitoring frequencies outlined in this report to ensure that AEs are detected and managed early if they do occur. However, little can be done to manage such AEs aside from considering dose reduction or discontinuation. This is consistent with authors of other studies of MEK inhibitors, who recommend periodic evaluations at regular intervals to facilitate early detection.<sup><xref rid=""CIT0037"" ref-type=""bibr"">37</xref></sup> Other AEs included fatigue, peripheral edema, and weight gain. However, consensus statements were not developed for these AEs, as the panel agreed that they are either relatively rare or low grade; for example, nearly all incidences of fatigue are grade 1 or 2 in severity. This report presents a strong level of consensus from a multidisciplinary group to support previous recommendations<sup><xref rid=""CIT0020"" ref-type=""bibr"">20</xref></sup> regarding several aspects of the prevention and management of AEs potentially associated with selumetinib. It is worth noting that, although it would have been beneficial to include representatives from all countries where selumetinib is approved, it would have been logistically difficult to reach a consensus on each statement between all representatives. Therefore, discussions were limited to the 10 European experts, which may limit worldwide application of these recommendations. As an additional limitation, although the Delphi consensus included recommendations on managing a wide range of AEs associated with selumetinib, it was not exhaustive of all possible scenarios (eg, issues of weight gain, liver toxicity in children with fatty liver disease, the need for prophylactic management of conditions pre-existing before selumetinib initiation such as acneiform rash). When pediatric patients start selumetinib treatment, various preventative measures and monitoring for early signs of toxicity should be taken to reduce the risk of AEs, to ensure treatment can continue, and to minimize the need for dose reduction (and potential reduced efficacy). To proactively prevent discontinuation due to AEs, it is important that patients and caregivers are informed about potential AEs and are aware of the various prevention and management strategies. If selumetinib is discontinued, it is important that patients can cope with the psychological burden of AEs upon reinitiation. For this reason, reinitiation can occur but the patient should be monitored for AEs after a guided break by an interdisciplinary team or upon new data available on rechallenge. The development of a variety of consensus statements indicates expert agreement on best practices for the prevention and management of AEs potentially associated with selumetinib in pediatric patients with NF1-PN. These events are generally manageable<sup><xref rid=""CIT0043"" ref-type=""bibr"">43</xref></sup> and should be considered alongside the overall treatment benefit. Information must be shared among healthcare professionals as further selumetinib experience is gained.

Interferon-Induced Transmembrane Protein 1 (IFITM1) Is Downregulated in Neurofibromatosis Type 1-Associated Malignant Peripheral Nerve Sheath Tumors,"Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1), an autosomal dominant genetic disorder, is caused by mutations in the <italic toggle=""yes"">NF1</italic> gene, which encodes the GTPase-activating protein neurofibromin. The pathogenesis of the tumor progression of benign plexiform neurofibromas (PNs) and malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors (MPNSTs) remain unclear. Here, we found that interferon-induced transmembrane protein 1 (IFITM1) was downregulated in MPNST tissues compared to those in PN tissues from patients with NF1. Overexpression of IFITM1 in NF1-associated MPNST cells resulted in a significant decrease in Ras activation (GTP-Ras) and downstream extracellular regulatory kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2) phosphorylation, whereas downregulation of IFITM1 via treatment with small interfering RNA in normal Schwann cells had the opposite result, indicating that expression levels of IFITM1 are closely associated with tumor progression in NF1. Treatment of MPNST cells with interferon-gamma (IFN-γ) significantly augmented the expression of IFITM1, thereby leading to a decrease in Ras and ERK1/2 activation. Despite the small number of patient samples, these findings may potentially provide a new target for chemotherapy in patients with NF1-associated MPNSTs. In xenograft mice injected with MPNST cells, <italic toggle=""yes"">IFN-</italic>γ treatment successfully suppressed tumor progression with increased IFITM1 expression and decreased Ras and ERK1/2 activation in tumor tissues. Collectively, these results suggest that IFITM1 is closely involved in MPNST pathogenesis and that IFN-γ is a good candidate for the therapeutic treatment of MPNSTs in NF1.","Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1), also known as von Recklinghausen disease, is an autosomal dominant genetic disorder that affects 1 in approximately 3500 individuals worldwide [<xref rid=""B1-ijms-25-09265"" ref-type=""bibr"">1</xref>,<xref rid=""B2-ijms-25-09265"" ref-type=""bibr"">2</xref>]. Common clinical manifestations of NF1 include Lisch nodules, bone dysplasia, café-au-lait spots, axillary freckling, optic nerve glioma, and nerve sheath tumors [<xref rid=""B3-ijms-25-09265"" ref-type=""bibr"">3</xref>]. NF1 is caused by a mutation in <italic toggle=""yes"">NF1</italic>, which encodes the Ras-GTPase tumor suppressor neurofibromin [<xref rid=""B4-ijms-25-09265"" ref-type=""bibr"">4</xref>]. Malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor (MPNST) is a highly invasive sarcoma of soft tissues, with a 5-year overall survival rate of 15–66% in patients with NF1; however, surgical resection is the only treatment that can increase the survival rate [<xref rid=""B5-ijms-25-09265"" ref-type=""bibr"">5</xref>,<xref rid=""B6-ijms-25-09265"" ref-type=""bibr"">6</xref>]. The possibility of patients with NF1 developing MPNST has been estimated to be 8–13% [<xref rid=""B7-ijms-25-09265"" ref-type=""bibr"">7</xref>] and 5.9–10.3% [<xref rid=""B8-ijms-25-09265"" ref-type=""bibr"">8</xref>]. MPNSTs are strongly associated with internal plexiform neurofibromas (PNs) [<xref rid=""B9-ijms-25-09265"" ref-type=""bibr"">9</xref>], indicating that tumor progression is a major concern in patients with NF1 [<xref rid=""B10-ijms-25-09265"" ref-type=""bibr"">10</xref>]. Previous studies suggested that loss of heterozygosity (LOH) of the <italic toggle=""yes"">NF1</italic> gene in Schwann cells is a key factor in developing neurofibromas [<xref rid=""B11-ijms-25-09265"" ref-type=""bibr"">11</xref>,<xref rid=""B12-ijms-25-09265"" ref-type=""bibr"">12</xref>].

Many studies noted that genetic mutations or changes in the expression of tumor protein of key genes are commonly found in MPNSTs, including P53 (<italic toggle=""yes"">TP53</italic>), epidermal growth factor receptor (<italic toggle=""yes"">EGFR</italic>), cell surface glycoprotein (<italic toggle=""yes"">CD44</italic>), hepatocyte growth factor (<italic toggle=""yes"">HGF</italic>), cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 2a (<italic toggle=""yes"">CDKN2A</italic>), C-X-C chemokine receptor 4 (<italic toggle=""yes"">CXCR4</italic>), MET proto-oncogene (<italic toggle=""yes"">MET</italic>), platelet-derived growth factor receptors alpha and beta (<italic toggle=""yes"">PDGFRA</italic> and <italic toggle=""yes"">PDGFRB</italic>), RB transcriptional corepressor 1 (<italic toggle=""yes"">RB1</italic>), and SRY-box transcription factor 9 (<italic toggle=""yes"">SOX9</italic>) [<xref rid=""B14-ijms-25-09265"" ref-type=""bibr"">14</xref>,<xref rid=""B15-ijms-25-09265"" ref-type=""bibr"">15</xref>,<xref rid=""B16-ijms-25-09265"" ref-type=""bibr"">16</xref>,<xref rid=""B17-ijms-25-09265"" ref-type=""bibr"">17</xref>,<xref rid=""B18-ijms-25-09265"" ref-type=""bibr"">18</xref>].

However, the other key factors closely involved in the progression of benign PNs to MPNSTs remain unclear. In our previous study, based on reverse transcription–polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR)-based differential display analysis, we found that interferon-induced transmembrane protein 1 (IFITM1) was downregulated in MPNST tissues of patients with NF1 compared to that in benign tumor tissues [<xref rid=""B29-ijms-25-09265"" ref-type=""bibr"">29</xref>]. Although several studies have suggested that interferon-inducible IFITM1 may play a role in antiproliferation and in cell adhesion signals [<xref rid=""B30-ijms-25-09265"" ref-type=""bibr"">30</xref>,<xref rid=""B31-ijms-25-09265"" ref-type=""bibr"">31</xref>,<xref rid=""B32-ijms-25-09265"" ref-type=""bibr"">32</xref>], the involvement of IFITM1 in MPNST pathogenesis remains unexplored. In this study, we investigated the hypothesis that the reduction of IFITM1 in MPNSTs is associated with the activation of the Ras/ERK signaling pathway, which is known to be involved in the malignant transformation of NF1. First, we assessed the basal expression levels of IFITM1 in the PN and MPNST tissues of six patients with NF1 and NF1-associated Schwann cell lines. Next, we examined whether IFITM1 levels were inversely correlated with Ras/ERK signaling activation by manipulating IFTM1 expression in normal and NF1-associated MPNST cells. Finally, we demonstrated that interferon-gamma (IFN-γ), which is known to induce IFITM1 expression, suppressed tumor progression in xenograft mice injected with MPNST cells.  Previous studies reported that IFITM1 expression is responsive to IFNs α and γ and that downregulation of IFITM1 was detected in cervical cancer and hepatocellular carcinoma [<xref rid=""B31-ijms-25-09265"" ref-type=""bibr"">31</xref>,<xref rid=""B32-ijms-25-09265"" ref-type=""bibr"">32</xref>]. IFN-γ induces a decrease in the intracellular calcium pump and consequently causes antiproliferative effects in cytokine-induced human salivary gland cells [<xref rid=""B44-ijms-25-09265"" ref-type=""bibr"">44</xref>]. Elevated IFITM1 levels were associated with improved survival outcomes in patients with chronic myeloid leukemia and glioblastoma [<xref rid=""B30-ijms-25-09265"" ref-type=""bibr"">30</xref>,<xref rid=""B45-ijms-25-09265"" ref-type=""bibr"">45</xref>]. In NF1 studies, several data showed that IFN-γ treatment or IFN-γ gene transfection directly inhibited the proliferation of NF1-associated MPNSTs or neurofibroma cells [<xref rid=""B46-ijms-25-09265"" ref-type=""bibr"">46</xref>,<xref rid=""B47-ijms-25-09265"" ref-type=""bibr"">47</xref>,<xref rid=""B48-ijms-25-09265"" ref-type=""bibr"">48</xref>].  However, the molecular function of IFN-γ-mediated IFITM1 at the cellular level during tumor progression remains controversial. Several studies have shown the involvement of IFITM1 in the progression of colorectal cancer and resected gastric and esophageal adenocarcinomas [<xref rid=""B49-ijms-25-09265"" ref-type=""bibr"">49</xref>,<xref rid=""B50-ijms-25-09265"" ref-type=""bibr"">50</xref>,<xref rid=""B51-ijms-25-09265"" ref-type=""bibr"">51</xref>]. These reports suggested that IFN-γ-responsive genes may have important roles in the malignant progression of tumors. These contrasting results may be explained by cell type specificity. Studies showing the positive role of IFITM1 in tumor progression have mainly used epithelial cells and fibroblasts. However, NF1 studies, including the current study, mainly used Schwann cells because they are considered the main cell type of tumor origin [<xref rid=""B52-ijms-25-09265"" ref-type=""bibr"">52</xref>]. Therefore, we focused on all experiments involving Schwann cells in tumor tissues and cell lines. IFITM1 expression in tumor tissues was examined in S100-positive Schwann cells.  In this study, we found that IFITM1 was downregulated in MPNST tumor tissue samples from patients with NF1 and NF1-associated MPNST Schwann cell lines (<xref rid=""ijms-25-09265-f001"" ref-type=""fig"">Figure 1</xref> and <xref rid=""ijms-25-09265-f002"" ref-type=""fig"">Figure 2</xref>). Overexpression of IFITM1 in <italic toggle=""yes"">NF1</italic>-associated MPNST cells caused a significant decrease in Ras activation (GTP-Ras) and downstream ERK1/2 phosphorylation, indicating that the expression level of IFITM1 was inversely correlated with tumor progression in NF1 (<xref rid=""ijms-25-09265-f002"" ref-type=""fig"">Figure 2</xref>). IFN-γ treatment significantly induced IFITM1 expression in MPNST cells and xenograft mice, and this IFN-γ-mediated IFITM1 upregulation may have caused the suppression of Ras and ERK1/2 (<xref rid=""ijms-25-09265-f003"" ref-type=""fig"">Figure 3</xref> and <xref rid=""ijms-25-09265-f004"" ref-type=""fig"">Figure 4</xref>).  MPNST is associated with a poor prognosis and is the leading cause of mortality in patients with NF1 [<xref rid=""B53-ijms-25-09265"" ref-type=""bibr"">53</xref>]. Owing to their aggressive and invasive nature and tendency for local relapse, the treatment of NF1-associated MPNSTs, which include surgery, radiotherapy, immunotherapy, and chemotherapy, lacks data regarding improved overall survival in patients [<xref rid=""B54-ijms-25-09265"" ref-type=""bibr"">54</xref>]. Chemotherapy alone or in combination with anticancer drugs, such as doxorubicin, carboplatin, dactinomycin, ifosfamide, gemcitabine, ocetaxel, etoposide, cisplatin, vincristine, cyclophosphamide, imidazole, and carboxamide, has been used; however, data on their efficacy are limited [<xref rid=""B54-ijms-25-09265"" ref-type=""bibr"">54</xref>]. As targeted therapeutic strategies, clinical trials with MEK inhibitors, such as sorafenib and selumetinib; the mTOR inhibitor sirolimus, the VEGF-A inhibitor bevacizumab; the Hsp90 inhibitor ganetespib; the selective c-KIT inhibitor pexidartinib; and the multi-kinase inhibitor pazopanib have been explored; however, effective response data are not available yet [<xref rid=""B54-ijms-25-09265"" ref-type=""bibr"">54</xref>]. Clinical trials of polyethylene glycolylated interferon-alpha-2b have been conducted in patients with NF1-related PN [<xref rid=""B55-ijms-25-09265"" ref-type=""bibr"">55</xref>]. However, clinical trials of IFN-γ for NF1 treatment have not been conducted. IFN-γ plays a key role in the activation of cellular immunity and stimulation of antitumor immune response [<xref rid=""B56-ijms-25-09265"" ref-type=""bibr"">56</xref>]. IFN-γ has been used in clinical trials because it contributes to the efficiency of cancer immunotherapy and enhances tumor senescence and apoptosis of cancer cells and inhibits metastasis and angiogenesis [<xref rid=""B56-ijms-25-09265"" ref-type=""bibr"">56</xref>]. Recently, results of a phase 1 study of the combination of IFN-γ and nivolumab for patients with advanced solid tumors have reported that the therapy was safe and revealed a modest benefit and that IFN-γ induction increased circulating chemokines [<xref rid=""B57-ijms-25-09265"" ref-type=""bibr"">57</xref>]. Based on our in vivo results in xenograft mice, IFN-γ, alone or in combination with other anticancer drugs, may be a promising clinical trial candidate for the treatment of NF1 patients with MPNSTs.  Collectively, our results suggest that IFITM1 acts as a negative regulator of Ras/ERK signaling in MPNST cells and xenograft mice. Therefore, IFITM1 may be a potential biomarker for evaluating tumor progression in NF1. More importantly, IFN-γ, which can effectively induce IFITM1 expression, may be a good candidate for the therapeutic treatment of MPNSTs in NF1.   IFITM1 is significantly downregulated in MPNST tissues from patients with NF1 and in NF1-associated MPNST cell lines. Treatment of MPNST cell lines and MPNST cell-injected xenograft mice with IFN-γ resulted in increased IFITM1 expression and decreased Ras and ERK1/2 activation. IFN-γ successfully inhibited tumor progression in the xenograft mice. These results suggest that IFITM1 is closely involved in MPNST pathogenesis and that IFN-γ can effectively suppress the progression of benign PN tumor to MPNST in NF1 through IFITM1 induction and subsequent negative regulation of the Ras/ERK signaling pathway.

The main features of NF1 are multiple café-au-lait macules (CALMs), lentiginous macules, and a predisposition to benign and malignant tumors<sup><xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR1"">1</xref></sup>. Cognitive and psychosocial problems, including learning disabilities, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, and autism spectrum disorders, are more prevalent in the NF1 population compared to the general population<sup><xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR2"">2</xref>,<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR3"">3</xref></sup>. Vasculopathy, such as hypertension and vascular abnormalities of the heart, brain, kidneys, or other major arteries, is an important cause of complications or even early death in patients with NF1. The life expectancy is about 10–15 years shorter than the general population and lifelong medical follow-up is advised, preferably by a specialized NF1 clinic. Diagnosis relies on clinical assessment according to standardized criteria<sup><xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR4"">4</xref>,<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR5"">5</xref></sup>. Sporadic patients with NF1 are diagnosed when presenting two or more of the most characteristic clinical NF1 features or with only one for children, usually CALMs, and an <italic toggle=""yes"">NF1</italic> pathogenic variant. For familial cases, the presence of one clinical NF1 feature, and an affected parent would be sufficient to clinically diagnose the patient, although a molecular test can be recommended to confirm the clinical diagnosis. The disease is marked by poor genotype–phenotype correlation, with the exception of a few specific variations<sup><xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR6"">6</xref>–<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR11"">11</xref></sup>, and high inter- and intra-familial variability<sup><xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR12"">12</xref>–<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR14"">14</xref></sup>. In more than 95% of cases, NF1 is caused by autosomal dominant loss-of-function variants in the <italic toggle=""yes"">NF1</italic> gene<sup><xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR15"">15</xref></sup>. <italic toggle=""yes"">NF1</italic> is located at 17q11.2 and encodes a GTPase-activating protein (neurofibromin) that acts as a negative regulator of the RAS-mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling cascade<sup><xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR16"">16</xref></sup>. The <italic toggle=""yes"">NF1</italic> gene shows one of the highest mutation rates, with >3700 different pathogenic variants referenced in public databases (Leiden Open Variation Database, LOVD, and Human Gene Mutation Database). The large spectrum of <italic toggle=""yes"">NF1</italic> pathogenic variants is distributed through the entire coding region and splice sites with no hotspot. Point mutations but also large deletions encompassing <italic toggle=""yes"">NF1</italic> and neighboring genes were described<sup><xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR11"">11</xref>,<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR17"">17</xref>–<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR20"">20</xref></sup>. More than 50% of <italic toggle=""yes"">NF1</italic> germline pathogenic variants arise de novo, and a relatively high frequency of mosaicism is observed in NF1 cohorts. There are different types of mosaicisms that describe which parts of the body harbor the mutated cells and the potential for transmission to offspring. These include isolated germline mosaicism (also called gonadal mosaicism), somatic mosaicism, and a combination of germline and somatic mosaicism<sup><xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR21"">21</xref>–<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR23"">23</xref></sup>. Although these classifications are useful in a practical sense, they cannot be conclusively assigned owing to the limitations of tissue sampling. Only somatic cells (mainly from blood and skin) are routinely used in genetic analyses, and a hint about possible germline mosaicism can be obtained only if somatic mosaicism is detected, or if more affected siblings are born with an identical de novo variant. Patients with mosaic NF1 may more often develop mild NF1 phenotypes or manifestations limited to the affected area of the body with often unilateral manifestations. The presence of mosaic NF1 can complicate molecular diagnosis (with a low variant allele frequency (VAF) of the pathogenic <italic toggle=""yes"">NF1</italic> variant) and specific criteria for mosaic NF1 have been defined, including neurofibroma analysis to help identify the causative <italic toggle=""yes"">NF1</italic> variation<sup><xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR4"">4</xref></sup>. It has been estimated that ~10% of sporadic NF1 patients have mosaic NF1 caused by postzygotic <italic toggle=""yes"">NF1</italic> mutations that are absent from, or present in, a very low proportion of blood lymphocytes<sup><xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR24"">24</xref></sup>. Genetic counseling, risk assessment, and fertility options for NF1 mosaic parents present clear challenges<sup><xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR25"">25</xref></sup>. Molecular analysis of the <italic toggle=""yes"">NF1</italic> gene is important in clinical practice to confirm the diagnosis, to differentiate from phenocopies (such as Legius syndrome; MIM#611431)<sup><xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR26"">26</xref></sup>, and to allow genetic counseling<sup><xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR27"">27</xref></sup>. Each child of an individual with NF1 has a 50% chance of inheriting the disease-causing variant. NF1 is considered to be fully penetrant; thus, a child who inherits an <italic toggle=""yes"">NF1</italic> pathogenic variant is expected to develop features of NF1, but the features may be considerably more (or less) severe in an affected child than in his or her affected parent. In fact, NF1 is considered fully penetrant by the age of eight years with extremely variable clinical manifestations, even within families carrying the same variant [7–8]. A clear genotype–phenotype correlation has only been established for a few <italic toggle=""yes"">NF1</italic> variants and remains an area of active research<sup><xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR6"">6</xref>–<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR8"">8</xref>,<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR10"">10</xref>,<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR18"">18</xref></sup>. The unpredictable clinical expression in offspring can complicate reproductive decision-making for NF1 patients and their partners<sup><xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR28"">28</xref>–<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR31"">31</xref></sup>. In France, one of the options for preventing the birth of an affected child is prenatal diagnosis (PND) by chorionic villus sampling (CVS) or amniocentesis, with the option to terminate the pregnancy if the fetus is affected. Another option is preimplantation genetic testing<sup><xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR32"">32</xref></sup>. PND and preimplantation genetic testing for a pregnancy at increased risk are possible if the disease-causing variant is known, or if there are multiple affected family members, and linkage has been established within the family<sup><xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR29"">29</xref></sup>; such testing is useful for establishing the presence of the parental mutation in the fetal DNA, but as noted, cannot make any prediction about disease severity. We report a retrospective 5-year study of PND (2017–2022) in a French diagnosis laboratory for NF1. In each family, the proband’s <italic toggle=""yes"">NF1</italic> pathogenic variant was identified using a targeted next-generation sequencing (NGS) approach. PND consisted of the combination of direct molecular diagnosis using Sanger sequencing or quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) and indirect diagnostics by linkage analysis based on microsatellite markers segregation in the family, when applicable. In addition, we present two cases of PND in women with mosaic NF1, including the germ line: by PND screening, we showed that the fetuses were not affected but nevertheless carried the risk haplotype associated with the <italic toggle=""yes"">NF1</italic> pathogenic variants in the mosaic-affected parent. This study illustrates the value of PND in NF1, with crucial consequences for medical and genetic counseling decisions. Our observations also point to the challenges that may be associated with germline mosaics.  As NF1 is inherited following an autosomal dominant pattern, the risk of an affected offspring for an NF1 patient is 50% in every pregnancy. To avoid transmission of the disorder, several reproductive options can be discussed with a couple throughout the process of genetic counseling, such as PND or preimplantation genetic testing for monogenic disorders, among others. In both cases, it is necessary that the NF1-causing variant has been determined in the affected parent<sup><xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR27"">27</xref></sup>. Genetic PND of monogenic disorders is a process involving the use of a variety of techniques for the molecular characterization of potential monogenic disease in the fetus during pregnancy. The study of familial segregation of polymorphic markers (microsatellites) initially made it possible to carry out PND by indirect diagnosis using linkage analysis when the causal <italic toggle=""yes"">NF1</italic> variant was unknown and the markers informative, and made it possible to identify and monitor the risk haplotype by familial segregation. Advances in genomic medicine, due to the advent of NGS, allowed direct PND by identification of the pathogenic variant in fetal tissues<sup><xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR41"">41</xref></sup>. The study of polymorphic markers has been maintained to confirm that (i) the tissue studied is indeed of fetal and not maternal origin and (ii) the haplotype corresponds to that expected according to the allele identified by direct genetic test. Indirect analysis uses four intragenic microsatellites that cover about 50 Kb of the gene, as well as three extragenic markers on both sides of the gene to check for recombination events. The microsatellites are highly polymorphic and are also useful for detecting de novo <italic toggle=""yes"">NF1</italic> locus deletion in sporadic cases. In the present study, we report on our 5-years (2017–2022) experience as a PND laboratory for NF1. The couples received and understood detailed information on the risk of transmission, the high clinical variability, and the clinical features of NF1. The multidisciplinary PND center authorized a PND test, considering the patients’ request and the strong probability and severity of the disease. Among the 205 NF1 PNDs in 146 women, the majority were performed through CVS biopsies vs amniocentesis (88% vs 12%). A higher proportion of unaffected than affected fetuses have been diagnosed (59% vs 41%), and the main outcomes were either the birth of an unaffected child (58%) or pregnancy terminations of affected fetuses (34%, Table <xref rid=""Tab1"" ref-type=""table"">1</xref>). Among the 85 pregnancies in which the PND showed that the fetus was a carrier of the pathogenic variant, 16 (18%) were carried to term. The 16 couples consisted of nine familial and seven sporadic NF1 in one parent, with 12 affected women and 4 affected men. Among NF1 couples requesting PND in our French cohort, the female was affected in most of the cases (Table <xref rid=""Tab1"" ref-type=""table"">1</xref>; 87% vs 13%). With genders being equally affected, a possible explanation could be that reproductive counseling gets more attention from women with a hereditary condition compared to men, making women more aware of their reproductive options. Another factor could be the influence of the gender of the affected partner in the reproductive decision-making itself. A previous qualitative interview study showed that in reproductive decision-making between partners, the woman’s influence is considered greater since she is the individual undergoing the treatment and/or carrying the pregnancy<sup><xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR42"">42</xref></sup>. Finally, some studies have suggested that male fertility might be reduced in NF1 patients, which could also account for a lower proportion of affected fathers<sup><xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR43"">43</xref></sup> We observed a different attitude towards PND in women with an NF1 family history (mother or father and/or other family members affected) than in women who represented sporadic cases, as previously described<sup><xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR29"">29</xref></sup>: the majority of PND requests came from patients with sporadic NF1 in themselves or in a first affected child, and fewer from couples in which one of the parents had inherited the disease (Table <xref rid=""Tab1"" ref-type=""table"">1</xref>; 60% vs 40%). In the NF1 family history group, familiarity with the disease, coupled with increased knowledge and a feeling that complications can be managed, could be reasons for not wishing PND. In the sporadic group, the uncertainty of the clinical outcome and the fear of serious complications could explain for requesting PND. In this report, genetic PND was performed by invasive (CVS or amniocentesis) methods. Recent advances in the exploration of circulating fetal DNA (cfDNA) have made it possible to carry out a non-invasive prenatal test (NIPT)<sup><xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR44"">44</xref></sup><sup>,</sup><sup><xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR45"">45</xref></sup> where the sample is maternal peripheral blood. NIPT is mostly limited to the exclusion of either paternal or de novo mutations. Determination of fetal status with respect to maternal pathogenic variants remains more challenging, because haploidentical maternal and fetal sequences cannot be easily distinguished. Based on the study of maternal haplotype imbalance in cfDNA, relative haplotype dosage (RHDO) was developed to address this challenge. The analysis of the thousands of single nucleotide variants (SNVs) used in RHDO allows both maternal and paternal inheritance to be determined. RHDO assay tracks the inheritance of haplotypes rather than testing for a familial pathogenic variant directly<sup><xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR46"">46</xref></sup>: SNV counts obtained from cfDNA NGS are used to determine if the fetus has inherited the reference or alternative haplotype by grouping informative SNVs into statistically significant haplotype blocks. As the NIPT assay tracks the inheritance of haplotypes, it does not account for the possibility that the risk haplotype does not carry the pathogenic variant in the fetus, in the rare context of maternal germline mosaicism. It is important that practitioners using NIPT are aware of this specific and rare point. In the present cohort, two cases (2/146 tested women) illustrated the pitfall for indirect diagnosis that maternal germline mosaics can represent. In families 1 and 2 presented in Fig. <xref rid=""Fig1"" ref-type=""fig"">1</xref>, the two women with NF1, who opted for PND, had a mosaic NF1. In both families, direct PND analysis (CVS) showed the absence of the maternal <italic toggle=""yes"">NF1</italic> pathogenic variant in the fetus. However, microsatellite markers analysis showed that the risk haplotype (associated with the <italic toggle=""yes"">NF1</italic> pathogenic variant in the affected parent) had been transmitted. These rare cases of germline mosaicism (which are nevertheless observed in a relatively common disease such as NF1 in which half the cases are de novo) illustrate the pitfall of indirect PND or NIPT-RHDO approaches. Estimating the prevalence and levels of parental mosaicism and consequently, the recurrence risk is important. For an individual family with a child with a genetic disorder caused by an apparent de novo pathogenic variant, the uncertainty about the presence and the level of parental mosaicism makes counseling about recurrence risk challenging and imprecise. Moreover, the recurrence risk also depends on whether the parental mosaic mutation is present in the paternal or maternal germline and on the proportion of germ cells that harbor the mutation<sup><xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR47"">47</xref>,<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR48"">48</xref></sup>. However, only in an affected man, the existence of a germline mosaic can be demonstrated by screening for the <italic toggle=""yes"">NF1</italic> pathogenic variant in a sperm sample<sup><xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR47"">47</xref>,<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR49"">49</xref></sup>, as limitations prevent detection in maternal germ cells. The PND techniques currently available are varied and increasingly complex, which poses new analytical, legal, and ethical challenges<sup><xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR50"">50</xref></sup>. These rapid changes in practices offer new possibilities for non-invasive analyses, such as NIPT-RHDO for monogenic diseases of maternal transmission, which aims to adopt an indirect approach without identifying the pathogenic variant. However, certain specific cases (such as dominant diseases with several potentially mosaic de novo cases) need to be considered to prevent the risk of mistakes that could result from the absence of direct identification of the pathogenic variant. The complexity of the workflow for PND and NIPT-RHDO will necessitate increased communication between reproductive medicine specialists, clinical geneticists, obstetricians involved in PND, and the molecular genetics team to ensure that details regarding embryo/fetal genetic diagnosis are understood by all parties involved in the care of these unique cases.

   This is the first study to compare different 3D imaging systems to identify the most suitable imaging system and cNF measurement parameter for evaluation of cNFs in clinical trials. The three 3D imaging systems investigated in this study were all effective and reliable tools for providing quantitative measurements of cNF size. Each device possesses distinct strengths and limitations that may impact their utility when used in a clinical setting. Based on our findings and experience with each device, the LifeViz Micro demonstrated best precision for surface area measurements, and the shortest time for image acquisition and analysis. For quantitative analysis in clinical trials, change in cNF surface area is recommended as the primary endpoint, since this was one of the most consistent and reliable measurement parameters examined. The use of 3D imaging is a reliable and effective tool for quantitative analysis of cNFs, enabling objective assessment of treatment outcomes. We identify cNF surface area as the most suitable primary endpoint for cNF imaging. The Vectra H1, LifeViz Micro and Cherry Imaging each possess distinct strengths and limitations that need to be considered. The authors declare that there are no conflicts of interest.

Unraveling neuronal and metabolic alterations in neurofibromatosis type 1,"Neurofibromatosis type 1 (OMIM 162200) affects ~ 1 in 3,000 individuals worldwide and is one of the most common monogenetic neurogenetic disorders that impacts brain function. The disorder affects various organ systems, including the central nervous system, resulting in a spectrum of clinical manifestations. Significant progress has been made in understanding the disorder’s pathophysiology, yet gaps persist in understanding how the complex signaling and systemic interactions affect the disorder. Two features of the disorder are alterations in neuronal function and metabolism, and emerging evidence suggests a potential relationship between them. This review summarizes neurofibromatosis type 1 features and recent research findings on disease mechanisms, with an emphasis on neuronal and metabolic features.","Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) is a multisystemic autosomal-dominant condition affecting ~ 1 in 3,000 live births worldwide [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR1"">1</xref>–<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR4"">4</xref>]. Historical recognition of the disorder dates to ancient Egypt [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR5"">5</xref>, <xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR6"">6</xref>], with Friedrich Daniel von Recklinghausen providing the first comprehensive clinical description in 1882. Initially termed “von Recklinghausen disease,” it is now known as neurofibromatosis type 1 [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR7"">7</xref>, <xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR8"">8</xref>]. Significant progress has been made in understanding NF1’s genetic underpinnings. The disorder is caused by mutations in a single gene, neurofibromin 1 (<italic toggle=""yes"">NF1</italic>) [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR9"">9</xref>], which encodes the protein neurofibromin (Nf1). Several pivotal discoveries made in the late 1990s include the establishment of diagnostic criteria for accurate NF1 diagnosis [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR10"">10</xref>, <xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR11"">11</xref>], mapping of the <italic toggle=""yes"">NF1</italic> gene to chromosome 17q11.2 [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR12"">12</xref>–<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR14"">14</xref>], and the identification of its protein product [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR12"">12</xref>, <xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR15"">15</xref>–<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR19"">19</xref>]. Despite these advances (and more since then), gaps persist in our understanding of the disorder and its underlying genetic, cellular, and systemic mechanisms. Features of the disorder include alterations in neuronal and brain function as well as metabolic alterations [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR20"">20</xref>–<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR24"">24</xref>]. Some of the features of the disorder, including the brain/cognitive symptoms, could be influenced by the metabolic alterations. Here we review the mechanisms of NF1 pathophysiology, with a focus on the emerging understanding of neuronal and metabolic alterations. NF1 is characterized by a broad spectrum of clinical manifestations that begin in infancy and progressively worsen (Fig. <xref rid=""Fig1"" ref-type=""fig"">1</xref>) [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR25"">25</xref>, <xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR26"">26</xref>]. Diagnostic criteria for NF1, first established in 1987 [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR10"">10</xref>] and updated in 2021 [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR11"">11</xref>] (Table <xref rid=""Tab1"" ref-type=""table"">1</xref>), rely on a physical examination and family history review. Some symptoms emerge in an age-dependent manner, making proper diagnosis during early childhood challenging, particularly for those lacking a family history of the disease (half of NF1 cases stem from de novo mutations) [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR3"">3</xref>, <xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR11"">11</xref>, <xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR20"">20</xref>]. These challenges led to revisions of the diagnostic criteria, incorporating mosaic neurofibromatosis and genetic testing [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR11"">11</xref>]. Symptoms of NF1 include increased susceptibility to various tumors, including peripheral nerve tumors like neurofibromas, plexiform neurofibromas, and malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors, as well as brain tumors such as optic pathway gliomas and brainstem gliomas [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR1"">1</xref>, <xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR25"">25</xref>, <xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR27"">27</xref>, <xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR28"">28</xref>]. Although tumors are a primary clinical characteristic of NF1, it also produces non-tumor symptoms including pigmentation defects, skeletal abnormalities, stunted growth, cognitive impairments, and behavioral alterations [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR27"">27</xref>, <xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR29"">29</xref>]. NF1 reduces life expectancy by 8–15 years [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR30"">30</xref>–<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR32"">32</xref>] and significantly impacts quality of life, with up to 80% of children experiencing moderate to severe cognitive impairments [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR22"">22</xref>, <xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR29"">29</xref>].<fig id=""Fig1""><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>Disease progression and clinical features of NF1.

Endovascular treatment of contained ruptured internal thoracic artery aneurysm mimicking a tumor in a patient with neurofibromatosis type 1: a case report,,"An internal thoracic artery aneurysm (ITAA) is a rare disease. Of the 40 cases reported from 1973 to 2012, approximately two-thirds were iatrogenic pseudoaneurysms associated with sternotomy or placement of central venous catheters or pacemaker leads, while the remaining cases were due to vasculitis, connective tissue diseases, neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF-1), fibromuscular dysplasia, and atherosclerosis, or were idiopathic [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR1"">1</xref>]. NF-1 is an autosomal dominant hereditary disorder caused by an abnormality in the long arm of chromosome 17 (17q11.2), occurring in approximately 1 in every 3000 births. Typical clinical manifestations include café-au-lait macules, freckling, peripheral neurofibromas, Lisch nodules, and skeletal abnormalities. Vascular involvement is uncommon, affecting only 3.6% of patients, but can be life-threatening [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR2"">2</xref>]. Although patients with NF-1 exhibit a wide spectrum of vascular abnormalities [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR3"">3</xref>], only seven cases of ruptured ITAA in NF-1 patients have been reported [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR4"">4</xref>–<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR10"">10</xref>]. Herein, we present a case of a contained rupture of an ITAA in a patient with NF-1, which posed a diagnostic challenge owing to its similarity to a tumor. Thin-slice contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CE-CT) proved useful for diagnosis, and successful endovascular treatment was achieved with coil embolization. A 32-year-old man developed persistent left back and upper arm pain and presented to the clinic 3 days after onset. Chest radiography showed left pleural effusion and an opacity at the apex of the left lung (Fig. <xref rid=""Fig1"" ref-type=""fig"">1</xref>), prompting referral to the pulmonology department the next day. He exhibited scattered café-au-lait spots and left-sided Horner syndrome characterized by ptosis and miosis. Computed tomography revealed a mass in the left upper mediastinum. Pleural puncture yielded bloody fluid (hemoglobin, 9.0 mg/dL), and the pleural effusion was sent for cell block analysis. Subsequent chest radiography revealed no increase in the left pleural effusion. With no evidence of acute bleeding, fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography–computed tomography (FDG-PET–CT) was scheduled to evaluate the mass the next day. The FDG-PET–CT scan identified a 38 × 53 mm mass in the left upper mediastinum, with an SUV max of 7.7 primarily accumulated at the margins (Fig. <xref rid=""Fig2"" ref-type=""fig"">2</xref>). These findings suggested an upper mediastinal tumor without lymph node involvement or distant metastasis. CE-CT was performed the next day for close examination, which revealed an approximately 25 mm contrast-enhancing mass in the left upper mediastinum, indicating a pseudoaneurysm of the left subclavian artery. The patient was transferred the same day for treatment of the subclavian pseudoaneurysm.<fig id=""Fig1""><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>Preoperative chest radiograph.

Blood tests showed a hemoglobin of 9.7 mg/dL and hematocrit of 28.6%. The patient met three of the National Institutes of Health diagnostic criteria for NF-1, including café-au-lait spots, spinal curvature, and family history. A 1-mm slice CE-CT scan was performed for surgical planning, and the presence of a hematoma around the aneurysm and the clinical course led to a diagnosis of a left ITAA with contained rupture (Fig. <xref rid=""Fig3"" ref-type=""fig"">3</xref>).<fig id=""Fig3""><label>Fig. 3</label><caption><p>Computed tomography scan.

Thereafter, through the 4 Fr catheter, a 1.9 Fr catheter (Carnelian MARVEL Non-Taper 1.9/1.9 Fr; Tokai Medical Products, Inc., Aichi, Japan) was inserted into the left internal thoracic artery (ITA) using a 0.014-in. guidewire (CHIKAI V 014; Asahi Intecc, Aichi, Japan) (Fig. <xref rid=""Fig4"" ref-type=""fig"">4</xref>B). This guidewire was passed through the distal portion of the aneurysm, allowing for successful cannulation with a 1.9 Fr catheter (Fig. <xref rid=""Fig4"" ref-type=""fig"">4</xref>C). The left ITA was successfully embolized at both the proximal and distal ends using several microcoils (Target 360 Ultra/Target Helical Ultra; Stryker Corp., Michigan, USA), each measuring 3–4 mm in diameter.

Postoperative CE-CT revealed a thrombosed ITAA with no extravasation, and the patient was discharged on the 4th postoperative day. At the 6-month follow-up, the ITAA had shrunk, and the patient was in good general condition. We successfully treated a patient with NF-1 who presented with a ruptured left ITAA. The ITAA rupture manifested as a hemothorax, followed by spontaneous hemostasis. Unlike previous reports that consistently showed an acute progression [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR4"">4</xref>–<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR10"">10</xref>], this case presented a subacute clinical course. The diagnosis was challenging and time-consuming, but was ultimately reached. The small size and tumor-like appearance of an ITAA make diagnosis difficult [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR11"">11</xref>]. The PET–CT findings also complicated the diagnosis, but the accumulation was due to inflammation around the ruptured aneurysm. Therefore, vascular abnormalities should also be considered when identifying mediastinal tumors. In this case, CE-CT was useful in diagnosing an aneurysm, and thin-slice CE-CT was especially crucial for differentiating a subclavian artery aneurysm from an ITAA. Only seven cases of ruptured ITAA associated with NF-1 have been reported [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR4"">4</xref>–<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR10"">10</xref>]. Two patients were hemodynamically unstable and underwent surgery [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR4"">4</xref>, <xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR5"">5</xref>], another two received a combination of endovascular treatment and surgery [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR6"">6</xref>, <xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR7"">7</xref>], while the remaining three were managed exclusively with endovascular treatment [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR8"">8</xref>–<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR10"">10</xref>]. Only the latter five patients survived. To date, there are no reports indicating whether surgery or endovascular treatment is superior for patients with stable vitals, but there are many reports of successful endovascular treatments [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR8"">8</xref>–<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR10"">10</xref>]. Therefore, we opted for endovascular treatment with surgical backup. If peripheral coil embolization of the ITAA was not feasible or if a residual leak remained, we planned to perform ITA clipping via left anterior thoracotomy. Fortunately, the aneurysm treatment was successfully completed using coil embolization. Data on the long-term prognosis of coil embolization for ITAA in patients with NF-1 are scarce and require careful outpatient follow-up. This case highlights the importance of considering vascular lesions in NF-1 patients who present with pleural effusion. It also emphasizes the challenges in diagnosing ITAA and the effectiveness of thin-slice contrast-enhanced computed tomography and endovascular treatments.",N/A,30 8 2024
Glioblastoma multiforme in a patient with neurofibromatosis type 1: a case report and review of literature,"Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is a highly aggressive brain tumor. Individuals with neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) have an increased risk of developing GBM. We present a case report of a 44-year-old male with NF1 who developed GBM. NF1-associated GBM presents distinct molecular features and younger age at diagnosis compared to sporadic cases. Treatment typically follows standard protocols for GBM. Despite advancements in neuro-oncology, gaps in knowledge persist regarding NF1-associated GBM, including its prevalence, molecular mechanisms, and optimal treatment strategies. Larger studies and collaborative efforts are needed to address these gaps and enhance patient care.","Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) is an autosomal dominant condition affecting multiple organ systems, with a prevalence of about 1 in 3000 individuals [<xref rid=""ref1"" ref-type=""bibr"">1</xref>]. It is part of a group of conditions described under the term ‘neurofibromatosis,’ which also includes neurofibromatosis type 2 and schwannomatosis, each with distinct clinical and genetic characteristics. Various studies have explored the relationship between gene function and clinical manifestations of NF1, including tumor development. While NF1 commonly involves benign tumors like pilocytic astrocytomas, it is worth noting that the majority of gliomas arising in adults with NF1 are malignant, typically glioblastomas [<xref rid=""ref2"" ref-type=""bibr"">2</xref>]. In our study, we report a rare case of a 44-year-old man with NF1, shedding light on complexities of this condition. In this case report, we present the clinical course of a 44-year-old male with NF1 who presented to our hospital with initial symptoms including headache, dizziness, ataxia, vomiting, nausea, and right eye blurring of vision for 2 weeks. Upon examination, the patient was conscious, alert, and oriented, with stable vital signs but demonstrated compromised vision in the right eye, an ataxic gait, and left homonymous hemianopia. Subsequent neuro-ophthalmic evaluation revealed decreased visual acuity and optic disc swelling in the left eye. The diagnosis of NF1 was supported by characteristic clinical findings, including the presence of neurofibromas and café-au-lait spots, illustrated in <xref rid=""f1"" ref-type=""fig"">Fig. 1A</xref> and <xref rid=""f1"" ref-type=""fig"">B</xref>, respectively. He also had Lisch nodules, bilateral axillary freckling, and scattered neurofibromas on his trunk along with reported learning difficulties, further supporting the diagnosis of NF1. A magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan showed extensive hypodense infiltrating disease in the right temporo-parietal region with associated vasogenic edema, alongside a significant space-occupying lesion (<xref rid=""f2"" ref-type=""fig"">Fig. 2</xref>). The patient underwent a right temporo-parietal craniotomy for lesion resection (<xref rid=""f3"" ref-type=""fig"">Fig. 3</xref>), followed by radiotherapy and temozolomide, and was transferred to the neuro intensive care unit for close monitoring. Postoperatively, the patient remained conscious, alert, and oriented, with stable vital signs, but exhibited left facial paresis, diminished vision in the right eye, and left-sided weakness. Pathological assessment confirmed a high-grade glioma, consistent with a World Health Organization grade IV tumor (<xref rid=""f4"" ref-type=""fig"">Fig. 4</xref>). It revealed an infiltrative, hypercellular astrocytoma characterized by hyperchromatic, elongated nuclei with irregular contours. A significant number of mitotic figures were observed. The histopathological assessment also demonstrated geographic and pseudopalisading necrosis, accompanied by microvascular proliferation, which are hallmark features of high-grade gliomas. The patient was kept under observation for 14 days, during which he remained in a good general condition and stable vital signs. He was advised to undergo physiotherapy sessions and was prescribed antibiotics. The case underscores the intricate interplay between genetic predisposition, tumor biology, and treatment response, emphasizing the imperative for further research to comprehend the underlying mechanisms driving the occurrence and aggressive nature of glioblastoma in the context of NF1. NF1, initially described by Friederich Daniel von Recklinghausen in 1882, represents the most common neurocutaneous syndrome. Its diagnosis relies on meeting at least two of the seven criteria established by the National Institute of Health Consensus Development Conference in 1988 (<xref rid=""TB1"" ref-type=""table"">Table 1</xref>). NF1 is attributed to mutations in the NF1-gene, located on chromosome 17q11.2, a tumor-suppressor gene involved in RAS-MAPK (mitogen-activated protein kinase) signaling. Neurofibromin, the NF1-gene product, acts as a negative regulator of the p21 Ras proto-oncogene, moderating cell growth. Therefore, patients with NF1 are predisposed to a higher risk of developing various benign and malignant tumors. Characteristically, neurofibromas affect nearly all patients with NF1 and can progress to malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors, contributing to poor survival rates [<xref rid=""ref3"" ref-type=""bibr"">3</xref>]. Additionally, NF1 patients commonly develop other tumors such as pilocytic astrocytomas, gastrointestinal stromal tumors, pheochromocytomas, and juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia. Although glioblastomas are not as common in NF1 as other tumors, estimated to account for approximately 7% of cases [<xref rid=""ref4"" ref-type=""bibr"">4</xref>], they remain a significant consideration within the spectrum of neoplasms associated with the condition. Larger studies are needed to assess glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) prevalence in NF1 patients, crucial for improving management and treatment strategies. Additionally, NF1 patients older than 10 years are estimated to have a 100-fold higher relative risk of developing brain tumors compared to individuals without NF1 [<xref rid=""ref2"" ref-type=""bibr"">2</xref>]. However, Huttner et al., in their review of five glioblastoma patients in children with NF1, suggested that the survival of glioblastoma patients with NF1 was better than those without NF1. The median overall survival of patients with and without NF1 was 9.25 and 1.08 years, respectively [<xref rid=""ref5"" ref-type=""bibr"">5</xref>]. NF1-associated GBMs manifest distinct molecular features, commonly lacking mutations in IDH1/2, TERT, and BRAF. Instead, they frequently exhibit the co-occurrence of p53 mutations, cooperating in malignant astrocytoma development [<xref rid=""ref6"" ref-type=""bibr"">6</xref>, <xref rid=""ref7"" ref-type=""bibr"">7</xref>]. The genetic signature of somatic NF1 mutations characterizes the mesenchymal subtype of GBM, which is associated with a worse overall outcome [<xref rid=""ref8"" ref-type=""bibr"">8</xref>]. In this report, we describe a case of GBM in a patient diagnosed with neurofibromatosis 1 (NF1). GBM represents the most prevalent primary malignant brain tumor in adults and is known for its aggressive nature, with a survival rate of less than 6% beyond 5 years of diagnosis [<xref rid=""ref9"" ref-type=""bibr"">9</xref>]. While the majority of GBM cases occur sporadically, individuals with certain genetic disorders such as neurofibromatosis, Turcot syndrome, and Li–Fraumeni syndrome have an inherent predisposition to developing GBM [<xref rid=""ref10"" ref-type=""bibr"">10</xref>]. It is noted that patients with NF1-associated glioblastoma are diagnosed at a significantly younger age (mean age 37 years) compared to those with sporadic glioblastoma (above 55) [<xref rid=""ref9"" ref-type=""bibr"">9</xref>]. Our patient was diagnosed at 44 years old, which is consistent with literature. Limited data exist on glioblastomas in individuals with NF1, with few cases reported (<xref rid=""TB2"" ref-type=""table"">Table 2</xref>). In most cases reported, GBM was located supratentorially with very few cases reported in the infratentorial region. In our case, the tumor was located temporo-parietally, which aligns with literature. Regarding treatment, all reported cases of glioblastoma in patients with NF, including ours, received the standard therapy for glioblastoma (gross total resection followed by fractionated radiotherapy and chemotherapy). In conclusion, NF1-associated GBM presents distinctive challenges given its unique molecular characteristics and tendency for diagnosis at a younger age. To better understand its specific molecular profiles and enhance prognosis and treatment outcomes, larger-scale studies are needed. ",N/A,8 2024
Diagnosis and management of neurofibromatosis type 1 in Arabian Gulf Cooperation Council Region: challenges and recommendations,"Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) is a complex multisystem genetic disorder that requires long-term, age-specific monitoring and multidisciplinary care. NF1 symptom burden can significantly affect the quality of life and impose a substantial economic burden on patients and their families. The approval and widespread availability of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MEK) inhibitors such as selumetinib for NF1-related plexiform neurofibromas have revolutionized the standard of care for patients with NF1, however their effective utilization hinges on early recognition of NF1. We present a consensus manuscript describing the challenges observed in the Arabian Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) for diagnosing and managing NF1. Experts from the GCC also present recommendations for the early recognition and management of NF1 and its complications. A referral pathway that can play a crucial role in helping primary healthcare providers refer their patients to experts is also proposed. Increasing the availability and accessibility of genetic testing at an affordable cost and optimizing personalized NF1 care are essential for NF1 management. Developing regional guidelines for NF1 management and establishing NF1 centers of excellence may facilitate better care and outcomes for patients with NF1 in the GCC region.","Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) is a progressive genetic disease, with a generally estimated global prevalence of 1 in 3000 to 1 in 6000 people (<xref rid=""B1"" ref-type=""bibr"">1</xref>, <xref rid=""B2"" ref-type=""bibr"">2</xref>). Recent studies have shown that NF1 is more common with a birth incidence of 1 in 2000 (<xref rid=""B3"" ref-type=""bibr"">3</xref>) and prevalence of 1/4088 (95% confidence interval (CI) 1 in 3,869 to 1 in 4,320) (<xref rid=""B4"" ref-type=""bibr"">4</xref>). It is characterized by neuroectodermal anomaly that mainly affects the skin, nervous system, eyes, bones, and possibly other organs, causing significant morbidity or mortality (<xref rid=""B1"" ref-type=""bibr"">1</xref>, <xref rid=""B2"" ref-type=""bibr"">2</xref>). NF1 is caused by heterozygous mutations in the neurofibromin gene (17q11.2) (<xref rid=""B5"" ref-type=""bibr"">5</xref>), which exhibits a high mutation rate of one in about 10,000 alleles per generation (<xref rid=""B6"" ref-type=""bibr"">6</xref>). This mutation is nearly 100‐fold higher than the average mutation rate per locus per generation (<xref rid=""B6"" ref-type=""bibr"">6</xref>). Nearly 33% to 50% of NF1 cases are caused by sporadic mutations (<xref rid=""B2"" ref-type=""bibr"">2</xref>, <xref rid=""B6"" ref-type=""bibr"">6</xref>). Several studies have found NF1 genotype-phenotype correlations and provided an overview of their significance, advocating their role in improving the management and genetic counselling of patients with NF1 (<xref rid=""B7"" ref-type=""bibr"">7</xref>–<xref rid=""B9"" ref-type=""bibr"">9</xref>). Koczkowska reported a genotype-phenotype correlation at the NF1 region 844–848, indicating a higher predisposition to malignancies in these individuals compared to the general NF1-affected population (p = 0.0061) (<xref rid=""B10"" ref-type=""bibr"">10</xref>). Patients with microdeletions in the NF1 gene were reported to have a 4-fold increased risk of malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors (MPNST) and this risk was further increased with codeletion of SUZ12 or EED gene (<xref rid=""B11"" ref-type=""bibr"">11</xref>). Therefore, diagnosis based on the clinical features and genetic testing may help to provide better care for patients with NF1 (<xref rid=""B7"" ref-type=""bibr"">7</xref>). Data is very limited on genotype-phenotype correlations in NF1. Although more than 3000 genetic mutations have been reported in the NF1 gene, only 4 actionable genotype-phenotype correlations are reported — type 1 microdeletion (caused by interchromosomal nonallelic homologous recombination), type 2 microdeletion (involving 1.2 Mb, linked with hemizygosity of 13 protein-coding genes), type 3 microdeletion (involving 1.0 Mb, linked with hemizygosity of 9 protein-coding genes), and type 4 microdeletions (unusual, comprised of a variable number of genes in the deleted region) (<xref rid=""B11"" ref-type=""bibr"">11</xref>). In most cases, disease severity is not typically predicted by a specific mutation and disease manifestations may vary within families carrying the same mutation (<xref rid=""B12"" ref-type=""bibr"">12</xref>). Therefore, a patient-centered longitudinal care with age-specific monitoring of clinical manifestations can be helpful for the early recognition and symptomatic treatment of disease sequelae in patients with NF1 (<xref rid=""B1"" ref-type=""bibr"">1</xref>). Due to the complexity of the disease, a multidisciplinary approach with frequent engagement between specialized healthcare providers (HCPs) in timely referral may improve the quality of care in patients with NF1 (<xref rid=""B13"" ref-type=""bibr"">13</xref>). The purpose of this consensus manuscript is to provide recommendations on the diagnosis, referral, and management of patients with NF1 for HCPs. This manuscript will also provide guidance for setting up the NF1 clinic and NF1 center of excellence in the Arabian Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) region. We planned a 3-step process to formulate the consensus recommendations for diagnosing and managing NF1 in the GCC region. A pre-meeting questionnaire-based survey was conducted focusing on disease burden, diagnostic, and management practices for NF1 in the GCC region (<xref rid=""SM1"" ref-type=""supplementary-material"">
<bold>Supplementary Material</bold>
</xref>). A literature search was conducted using PubMed to gather relevant publications on NF1 in the GCC region and internationally. A pre-meeting questionnaire based on the gathered information was formed and later validated by three of the Saudi Pediatric Neurology expert members. This questionnaire was disseminated to a group of 13 experts (from Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, UAE, Oman, and Qatar) formed by the Saudi Pediatric Neurology Society as an internal survey. The expert committee meeting convened on December 10, 2022, included a panel comprising a pediatric neurologist and oncologist, neuro-oncologist, neuro-ophthalmologist, neurosurgeon, and medical geneticist, which was supported by AstraZeneca GCC. The panel discussed the available data on disease burden and provided an update on the diagnostic and management practices and associated challenges specific to their region. Additionally, panel members recommended developing a referral algorithm and setting up NF1 clinics and/or NF1 centers of excellence in the GCC region. We present a consensus manuscript with recommendations for diagnosing and managing NF1 in the GCC region based on an evidence-based literature search and expert opinions. All experts critically reviewed, revised and approved the manuscript. A high proportion of the Arab population is affected by genetic disorders, accounting for 451 genetic disorders in the combined Arab populations of Bahrain, Oman, and the UAE; Oman with the most number of genetic disorders (<xref rid=""B14"" ref-type=""bibr"">14</xref>). Factors such as a higher prevalence of consanguineous marriages (Saudi Arabia [58%], Kuwait [54%], UAE [50%], and Qatar [52%]), lack of public health initiatives for preventing genetic and congenital abnormalities, inadequate prenatal and postpartum care and restriction on services to prevent and control of genetic disorders are accountable for higher prevalence of genetic disorders in GCC region (<xref rid=""B14"" ref-type=""bibr"">14</xref>–<xref rid=""B17"" ref-type=""bibr"">17</xref>). Patients with NF1 have been reported to be at an increased risk of developing malignancies and have a life expectancy of nearly 10 to 15 years shorter compared to the general population (<xref rid=""B18"" ref-type=""bibr"">18</xref>, <xref rid=""B19"" ref-type=""bibr"">19</xref>). Accurate data on the incidence and prevalence of NF1 in the GCC region along with the burden of the disease are not available. In addition, there is a lack of regional NF1 registries in the GCC region; most studies have evaluated the clinical spectrum and comorbidity associated with NF1 or the correlation between a specific genotype and phenotype (<xref rid=""B20"" ref-type=""bibr"">20</xref>–<xref rid=""B22"" ref-type=""bibr"">22</xref>). Based on the data of the pre-meeting questionnaire, the average number of cases of NF1 seen every month by the majority of the experts was ≤10. Apart from the clinical burden, NF1 is linked with the physical, social, economic, and psychological burden with each having a decent share in affecting the patient’s quality of life. All experts believed that amongst all of them, the psychological burden has the highest impact on the patient. A qualitative content analysis study by Foji et al., also reported a high level of both psychological and social burden on patients with NF1 that caused mental conflicts, eventually resulting in delayed developmental milestones among these patients (<xref rid=""B23"" ref-type=""bibr"">23</xref>).

Depending on the patient’s age, natural history, clinical presentation, variability in NF1 manifestations, prognosis, complications, and warning signs, prompt and rapid medical attention for specialist care is needed for patients with NF1. Experts indicated urgent referral of patients with MPSNT and brain tumors, followed by optic pathway glioma and plexiform neurofibromas owing to their poor prognosis. In GCC, half of the experts indicated referring more than 50% of patients diagnosed with NF1 for genetic testing. Diagnosis of NF1 and other genetic diseases is a critical event in the child’s and parents’ lives. Regardless of whether genetic testing is done or not, patients and their families must be referred to a genetic counselor for a detailed discussion of clinical outcomes and future reproductive choices after procuring a detailed family history of a pediatric patient with NF1. Prenatal and pre-implantation genetic testing can be provided once the parent carrying the causative NF1 mutation has been found. However, as NF1 expressivity varies, it is frequently impossible to predict the severity of the disease. <xref rid=""f5"" ref-type=""fig"">
<bold>Figure 5</bold>
</xref> shows the proposed referral algorithm for patients with NF1. Experts highlighted that indications for urgent and prompt referral to the concerned specialties are symptomatic subcutaneous or plexiform neurofibromas, cutaneous neurofibromas causing distress or irritation, squint, proptosis, reduced visual acuity or newly symptomatic optic pathway tumors. In such high-risk populations, a regular clinical evaluation must be performed at each visit that can be followed with a referral to apt specialists and oncologists as needed. Experts also pointed out that patients with visual symptoms must be urgently referred, while all asymptomatic patients must be referred to ophthalmology as routine referrals. NF1 patients have an increased likelihood of developing both benign and malignant tumors. Due to the variable features and inherent clinical heterogeneity, HCPs need to be aware of the diverse clinical features of NF1 to provide prompt diagnosis and optimum care for patients with NF1. Additionally, clinical manifestations of NF1 starting in the early pediatric age require frequent long-term follow-ups by several specialists, underscoring the need for MDT care and setting up a multidisciplinary center to enhance the quality of care (<xref rid=""B13"" ref-type=""bibr"">13</xref>). A MDT includes surgeons (general, neurosurgeons, orthopedic surgeons, and plastic surgeons) and NF experts in medicine/pediatrics (oncologist, neuro-oncologist, and neurologist). Experts from the GCC region acknowledged that MDT was available in their centers, however, there was a noticeable difference in the percentage of patients with NF1 receiving treatment using the MDT approach. A transition of NF1 patients from pediatric to adult care continues to be difficult due to the limited accessibility of specialty care for NF1 even in Western countries (<xref rid=""B112"" ref-type=""bibr"">112</xref>, <xref rid=""B113"" ref-type=""bibr"">113</xref>). In the GCC region, the major barriers to developing MDT for NF1 care as discussed by experts were the lack of regional NF1 registries and regional guidelines, the lack of specialists in many regions, and the considerable time needed for MDT setup. To overcome these challenges, all the experts recommended setting up centers of excellence for NF1 at a regional level. They also advocated for developing easy referral pathways for primary care physicians, organizing virtual MDT meetings, and training as well as continued education programs for developing MDT in their region. <xref rid=""f6"" ref-type=""fig"">

</xref> presents an overview of eligibility criteria for setting the NF1 center of excellence in the GCC region. Experts from GCC also underscore the need to evaluate the availability of MDT and services such as PET, MRI, and genetic testing in order to set up the center of excellence for NF1. A dedicated NF1 center of excellence will provide better accessibility to a broad range of specialties and recent treatment approaches through clinical trials. These clinics can also help in establishing registries on the prevalence and treatment of NF1. Improving the understanding of disease characteristics among patients, parents, and caregivers is a crucial component that can significantly impact the quality of life for individuals and families affected with NF1. Several patient advocacy groups like Children’s Tumor Foundation, Littlest Tumor Foundation, Neurofibromatosis Network, and Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia are focused on creating awareness and disseminating knowledge to enhance the understanding of NF1 among patients and families affected by NF1 alongside driving the research for preventing therapies for NF1 (<xref rid=""B114"" ref-type=""bibr"">114</xref>–<xref rid=""B117"" ref-type=""bibr"">117</xref>). Online resources from these advocacy groups provide brochures on the cognitive and social development of children with NF1, genetic testing brochures, infographics with NF1 diagnostic criteria, optic pathway gliomas, vascular disease in NF1, videos discussing the neuropsychological evaluation of students, and a guide for patients with NF1 and caregivers transitioning to adult care (<xref rid=""B115"" ref-type=""bibr"">115</xref>, <xref rid=""B118"" ref-type=""bibr"">118</xref>–<xref rid=""B120"" ref-type=""bibr"">120</xref>). These resources may help to provide a better understanding of NF1 and improve the quality of life among these patients. In the GCC, healthcare providers can also implement such initiatives in collaboration with the Saudi Pediatric Neurology Society or other societies by creating patient support groups and providing online educational resource materials for these patients to optimize the management of NF1. NF1 is a complex genetic disease that often requires communication between experts from various specialists and lifetime monitoring of patients. Despite recent advances in the management of NF1, it is associated with significant morbidity owing to its complexity with a shorter lifespan compared to the general population. Pediatricians are crucial in the diagnosis and referral of patients because a majority of the principal NF1 manifestations appear in children or adolescents. Genetic testing is recommended for NF1 diagnosis, and a better insight into the genotype-phenotype correlation is required. In patients with NF1, surveillance with six months to annual follow-up is indicated for the development of new manifestations that require timely and prompt referral to the concerned specialist. For the effective management of patients with inoperable plexiform neurofibromatosis or low/high-grade optic pathway tumors, systemic therapy with MEK1/2 inhibitors is recommended. Thus, there is a need to optimize personalized NF1 care by adopting MDT-based treatment approaches. Establishing regional registries, and NF1 centers of excellence and developing regional management guidelines and referral pathways can pave the way for providing better care to patients with NF1 in the Arabian GCC region.",N/A,27 8 2024
"Quality of Life in Children with Neurofibromatosis Type 1: Agreement between Parents and Patients, and the Role of Disease Severity and Visibility","Background: Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) is a genetic disorder that affects multiple systems in the body, often leading to physical disfigurements and a wide range of clinical symptoms. This study aims to investigate the relationship between NF1 severity and visibility and the quality of life (QoL) in children. Methods: The Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory (PedsQL) and a modified version of the Ablon scale were used to assess QoL and NF1 severity and visibility, respectively. Self-reported and parent-reported QoL scores were compared, and the associations between NF1 severity/visibility and QoL were explored. Results: Thirty-eight pediatric NF1 patients and their parents were enrolled. QoL scores did not differ significantly between patient self-reports and parent reports. However, correlational analyses revealed that higher NF1 severity was associated with lower physical QoL in patients, and greater NF1 visibility was linked to lower physical and social QoL. For parents, higher NF1 severity correlated with lower school functioning, whereas NF1 visibility did not show a significant correlation with QoL. Conclusion: The severity and visibility of NF1 have distinct impacts on various aspects of QoL in children, highlighting the need for tailored interventions that address both physical and psychological challenges. These findings underscore the importance of comprehensive care approaches in managing NF1 in pediatric populations.","Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) is an autosomal-dominant syndrome caused by mutations in the NF1 tumor-suppressor gene on chromosome 17 [<xref rid=""B1-children-11-01033"" ref-type=""bibr"">1</xref>]. The incidence at birth is 1:2000–3000 individuals in the general population [<xref rid=""B2-children-11-01033"" ref-type=""bibr"">2</xref>]. Approximately half of the cases are inherited, while the other half result from de novo mutations. NF1 is a multisystem disorder characterized by several dermatological manifestations, including café-au-lait macules (CALMs), cutaneous and plexiform neurofibromas (CNs and PNs) and Noonan-like features [<xref rid=""B2-children-11-01033"" ref-type=""bibr"">2</xref>]. Patients often experience itching and pain, with the latter mainly associated with PNs. NF1 can also lead to skeletal deformities, short stature, learning difficulties and brain gliomas, which predominantly occur in young patients. The spectrum of potential physical, cognitive, psychological and social effects associated with NF1 is sufficiently broad to have a significant impact on an individual’s quality of life (QoL) [<xref rid=""B3-children-11-01033"" ref-type=""bibr"">3</xref>,<xref rid=""B4-children-11-01033"" ref-type=""bibr"">4</xref>,<xref rid=""B5-children-11-01033"" ref-type=""bibr"">5</xref>,<xref rid=""B6-children-11-01033"" ref-type=""bibr"">6</xref>]. While the relationship between NF1 and QoL in adulthood is well-documented, data on pediatric QoL remain scarce. Evidence from the literature suggests that all aspects of QoL (i.e., patients’ social and relational interactions, mental health, appearance, pain levels and daily activities) seem to be impaired [<xref rid=""B7-children-11-01033"" ref-type=""bibr"">7</xref>,<xref rid=""B8-children-11-01033"" ref-type=""bibr"">8</xref>,<xref rid=""B9-children-11-01033"" ref-type=""bibr"">9</xref>]. The diminished QoL in NF1 appears to be due to the chronic nature, multisystem involvement and esthetic discomfort [<xref rid=""B10-children-11-01033"" ref-type=""bibr"">10</xref>,<xref rid=""B11-children-11-01033"" ref-type=""bibr"">11</xref>].  Regarding the visibility and dermatological manifestations of NF1, evidence indicates that a higher total number of cNFs or cNFs primarily located on the face are associated with worse QoL when assessed using skin disease-specific measures [<xref rid=""B9-children-11-01033"" ref-type=""bibr"">9</xref>,<xref rid=""B12-children-11-01033"" ref-type=""bibr"">12</xref>].  Some studies have shown that even in children, in whom cNFs are usually absent [<xref rid=""B2-children-11-01033"" ref-type=""bibr"">2</xref>], there is a perceived visibility of NF1 that negatively affects their QoL [<xref rid=""B5-children-11-01033"" ref-type=""bibr"">5</xref>,<xref rid=""B13-children-11-01033"" ref-type=""bibr"">13</xref>]. Recently, we reported that, in a group of children and adolescents with NF1, greater visibility of NF1 symptoms is associated with lower self-esteem [<xref rid=""B14-children-11-01033"" ref-type=""bibr"">14</xref>].  In addition to the visibility, the severity of NF1 symptoms is a fundamental determinant of patients’ QoL, psychosocial well-being and need for support in daily living [<xref rid=""B15-children-11-01033"" ref-type=""bibr"">15</xref>,<xref rid=""B16-children-11-01033"" ref-type=""bibr"">16</xref>,<xref rid=""B17-children-11-01033"" ref-type=""bibr"">17</xref>]. Pain is a significant factor in the estimation of the severity of NF1 and can further degrade QoL [<xref rid=""B18-children-11-01033"" ref-type=""bibr"">18</xref>,<xref rid=""B19-children-11-01033"" ref-type=""bibr"">19</xref>,<xref rid=""B20-children-11-01033"" ref-type=""bibr"">20</xref>]. Despite the significant impact of visibility and severity on QoL, research in this area remains limited. When assessing pediatric populations, parents are an important source of information and are often asked about their children’s QoL [<xref rid=""B21-children-11-01033"" ref-type=""bibr"">21</xref>]. The Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory (PedsQoL; ref. [<xref rid=""B22-children-11-01033"" ref-type=""bibr"">22</xref>]) is a multidimensional questionnaire designed to assess the impact of illness on QoL. It includes a self-report version for patients and a proxy report for parents. The degree of agreement between patient and parent reports of QoL varies across studies, with discrepancies noted in all areas of the scale, including emotional, social and physical functioning [<xref rid=""B23-children-11-01033"" ref-type=""bibr"">23</xref>,<xref rid=""B24-children-11-01033"" ref-type=""bibr"">24</xref>].  It is plausible that the presence of neurofibromas, scoliosis and other visible manifestations associated with NF1 may affect the physical aspect of QoL [<xref rid=""B10-children-11-01033"" ref-type=""bibr"">10</xref>]. Conversely, cognitive impairments, including intellectual disability, learning disabilities and executive deficits, which are quite common in patients with NF1, can affect school performance and social interactions, leading to lower social QoL [<xref rid=""B25-children-11-01033"" ref-type=""bibr"">25</xref>,<xref rid=""B26-children-11-01033"" ref-type=""bibr"">26</xref>].  In this study, we reanalyzed our previously published data on pediatric QoL in patients with NF1 using a modified Ablon scale [<xref rid=""B14-children-11-01033"" ref-type=""bibr"">14</xref>], which includes more detailed features than the original scale [<xref rid=""B27-children-11-01033"" ref-type=""bibr"">27</xref>]. Our aim was to examine the impact of visibility and severity on various domains of QoL and to explore the degree of agreement between children and their parents. We hypothesized that parents and patients would agree on QoL assessments and that NF1 visibility and severity would correlate with QoL. Specifically, we hypothesized that visibility would be associated with the socio-relational functioning of QoL.  The study included 38 consecutive subjects with NF1 (median age = 14.07 years, range = 8–17 years, interquartile range [IQR] = 5.94 years; female <italic toggle=""yes"">n</italic> = 17) and their parents [<xref rid=""B14-children-11-01033"" ref-type=""bibr"">14</xref>]. According to the modified Ablon scale, these patients were categorized based on the severity and visibility of their conditions.  Specifically, in terms of severity, 5 patients (13.2%) had a severe disease, 19 (50%) had a moderate disease and 14 (36.8%) had a mild disease. In terms of visibility, 3 patients (7.9%) had a severe phenotype, 22 (57.9%) had a moderate phenotype, 6 (15.8%) had a mild phenotype and 7 (18.4%) children had no visibility of their condition. There was no significant difference between patient and parent reports on QoL (<xref rid=""children-11-01033-t002"" ref-type=""table"">Table 2</xref>). However, a borderline statistically significant difference was observed in the social functioning domain (<xref rid=""children-11-01033-t002"" ref-type=""table"">Table 2</xref>).  In the patient group, the correlational analysis revealed that the severity score was significantly associated only with a lower physical QoL (r<sub>s</sub> = 0.423, <italic toggle=""yes"">p</italic> = 0.009). However, the visibility score was associated with decreased physical (r<sub>s</sub> = 0.416, <italic toggle=""yes"">p</italic> = 0.010) and social QoL (r<sub>s</sub> = 0.338, <italic toggle=""yes"">p</italic> = 0.041).  Conversely, within parent reports, severity was only related to lower school functioning (r<sub>s</sub> = 0.385, <italic toggle=""yes"">p</italic> = 0.021), while visibility showed no significant association with the total score or any QoL subdomains (r<sub>s</sub> = 0.215, <italic toggle=""yes"">p</italic> = 0.208). Finally, no significant associations were observed between the dimensions of quality of life (i.e., physical, emotional and social functioning) and the severity or visibility of NF1 in parents (r<sub>s</sub> = 0.220, <italic toggle=""yes"">p</italic> = 0.191). The objective of this study was to compare the self-reported QoL of pediatric patients with the QoL reported by caregivers in relation to their children. To this end, we investigated both how pediatric patients assess their own QoL and how parents evaluate the QoL of their children. Our findings indicate agreement between parents and children in terms of overall QoL as well as in the specific domains of PedsQoL. Previous research has reported discordance between self-reported and proxy-reported QoL in children with NF1, suggesting that information from parents and patients may originate from different perspectives and should be considered together [<xref rid=""B21-children-11-01033"" ref-type=""bibr"">21</xref>,<xref rid=""B30-children-11-01033"" ref-type=""bibr"">30</xref>]. Nevertheless, some studies on chronic health pediatric conditions have shown a high degree of concordance between parent and child reports, particularly in more observable domains such as physical functioning, as observed in our cohort [<xref rid=""B21-children-11-01033"" ref-type=""bibr"">21</xref>,<xref rid=""B31-children-11-01033"" ref-type=""bibr"">31</xref>]. Discrepancies in the literature may be attributed to several factors impacting agreement levels, including the child’s age, the QoL domains examined, the severity of the children’s illness, the sociocultural background and the QoL of parents themselves [<xref rid=""B21-children-11-01033"" ref-type=""bibr"">21</xref>,<xref rid=""B32-children-11-01033"" ref-type=""bibr"">32</xref>,<xref rid=""B33-children-11-01033"" ref-type=""bibr"">33</xref>]. If our results are confirmed by larger studies, parents could be considered valuable sources for describing the impact of the disease on QoL. Additionally, we investigated the impact of NF1 severity and visibility on the various QoL domains. According to patient reports, greater NF1 severity was associated with poorer physical QoL, whereas greater NF1 visibility was linked to poorer physical and social QoL [<xref rid=""B30-children-11-01033"" ref-type=""bibr"">30</xref>,<xref rid=""B34-children-11-01033"" ref-type=""bibr"">34</xref>,<xref rid=""B35-children-11-01033"" ref-type=""bibr"">35</xref>].  As widely demonstrated in the literature, the visibility of NF1 can impact QoL and mental health [<xref rid=""B4-children-11-01033"" ref-type=""bibr"">4</xref>,<xref rid=""B11-children-11-01033"" ref-type=""bibr"">11</xref>], as well as psychosocial aspects of QoL [<xref rid=""B15-children-11-01033"" ref-type=""bibr"">15</xref>]. This relationship has also been observed in other diseases with visible manifestations [<xref rid=""B7-children-11-01033"" ref-type=""bibr"">7</xref>,<xref rid=""B36-children-11-01033"" ref-type=""bibr"">36</xref>]. Individuals with NF1 often face social stigma due to the visible manifestations of the disease, such as cNF and café-au-lait spots [<xref rid=""B7-children-11-01033"" ref-type=""bibr"">7</xref>,<xref rid=""B37-children-11-01033"" ref-type=""bibr"">37</xref>]. Such visibility can lead to stress, social anxiety, depression, reduced self-esteem and social isolation [<xref rid=""B14-children-11-01033"" ref-type=""bibr"">14</xref>,<xref rid=""B19-children-11-01033"" ref-type=""bibr"">19</xref>,<xref rid=""B38-children-11-01033"" ref-type=""bibr"">38</xref>]. These individuals might experience anticipatory anxiety about social interactions, worrying about how others will react to their appearance. This persistent stress can contribute to mood disorders, creating a cycle where the psychological burden of the disease exacerbates the individual’s mental health [<xref rid=""B7-children-11-01033"" ref-type=""bibr"">7</xref>]. Our results confirm that disease visibility interferes with social functioning and relationships in pediatric patients with NF1, similar to other visible medical conditions. This interference can lead to a diminished QoL and fewer opportunities for social support, which is crucial for mental well-being [<xref rid=""B39-children-11-01033"" ref-type=""bibr"">39</xref>,<xref rid=""B40-children-11-01033"" ref-type=""bibr"">40</xref>]. Patients with more prominent physical manifestations (i.e., visible symptoms) experience higher levels of social avoidance and stigmatization [<xref rid=""B41-children-11-01033"" ref-type=""bibr"">41</xref>,<xref rid=""B42-children-11-01033"" ref-type=""bibr"">42</xref>,<xref rid=""B43-children-11-01033"" ref-type=""bibr"">43</xref>]. Children and adolescents with NF1 may appear more withdrawn [<xref rid=""B38-children-11-01033"" ref-type=""bibr"">38</xref>,<xref rid=""B44-children-11-01033"" ref-type=""bibr"">44</xref>], face socio-relational difficulties [<xref rid=""B45-children-11-01033"" ref-type=""bibr"">45</xref>,<xref rid=""B46-children-11-01033"" ref-type=""bibr"">46</xref>] and suffer bullying and teasing from peers [<xref rid=""B14-children-11-01033"" ref-type=""bibr"">14</xref>,<xref rid=""B47-children-11-01033"" ref-type=""bibr"">47</xref>,<xref rid=""B48-children-11-01033"" ref-type=""bibr"">48</xref>].  Additionally, greater severity of NF1 is associated with more pronounced neuropsychological disorders, such as cognitive and learning difficulties [<xref rid=""B49-children-11-01033"" ref-type=""bibr"">49</xref>], attention deficits [<xref rid=""B50-children-11-01033"" ref-type=""bibr"">50</xref>], memory deficits [<xref rid=""B51-children-11-01033"" ref-type=""bibr"">51</xref>] and intellectual disability [<xref rid=""B52-children-11-01033"" ref-type=""bibr"">52</xref>]. These conditions can adversely affect school performance [<xref rid=""B25-children-11-01033"" ref-type=""bibr"">25</xref>,<xref rid=""B53-children-11-01033"" ref-type=""bibr"">53</xref>]. The relationship between QoL and NF1 severity was also confirmed by parents’ reports, but it was limited to the effect on school functioning. This result might suggest that the severity score measured by the modified Ablon scale [<xref rid=""B14-children-11-01033"" ref-type=""bibr"">14</xref>], which accounts for a comprehensive list of neurodevelopmental issues, better delineates the neurological phenotype of patients. A worse severity score may be attributed to a more severe neurodevelopmental phenotype that might not be perceived by children. Moreover, school function reflects the adaptation profile of a child well, which is fundamental for parents.  In conclusion, the results suggest that for patients, the disease primarily impacts physical and social QoL, whereas for parents, the main concern is school functioning. However, there are some limitations to this study. Firstly, the limited number of participants suggests caution when generalizing the results. Despite this, few studies have investigated the relationship between QoL and the severity and visibility of NF1.  Secondly, using a non-NF1-specific questionnaire for assessing QoL presented certain limitations. Specifically, the PedsQL scale employed in this study is not tailored to NF1. Consequently, we could not explore specific QoL dimensions pertinent to NF1, such as “Skin Sensations” and “Skin Itch Bother”, which are included in the PedsQL Neurofibromatosis Type 1 Module [<xref rid=""B24-children-11-01033"" ref-type=""bibr"">24</xref>]. Regrettably, an adapted version of this module suitable for the Italian population is not yet available.  The modified Ablon scale considered features such as dysmorphisms, short stature and scoliosis, which are relatively common in children with NF1 as related to visibility that was not included in the original scale.  Using this version of the scale, we documented a significant correlation between visibility and severity, suggesting that visibility might be considered as an indirect index of disease severity. This novel finding must be further evaluated by future dedicated studies. A further limitation is the lack of a subjective measure of the visibility and severity of the disease. Such measures could provide information about how the patients perceive and evaluate their condition. Ideally, using subjective tools alongside objective methods to measure the visibility and severity of the disease would be desirable to further explore the association between NF1 and QoL. Future studies should replicate these findings and attempt to address these limitations. The findings of this study underscore the necessity for comprehensive QoL assessments that consider both visible and non-visible aspects of NF1. Clinicians should be encouraged to use multidimensional assessment tools that capture the full spectrum of the impact of NF1 on a child’s life. The early identification of QoL disorders could facilitate the implementation of proactive and personalised treatment plans, thereby improving patient outcomes. The association between NF1 visibility and social QoL suggests that psychosocial interventions aimed at reducing social stigma, strengthening self-esteem and improving relationships with peers could significantly benefit these patients. Support groups, counselling and social skills training could be valuable components of a comprehensive treatment plan. The findings of this study highlight the intricate association between disease severity, visibility and specific domains of QoL in children and adolescents with NF1.  This association suggests that tailored interventions are necessary to address the physical, social and academic challenges faced by patients with NF1.  Future research should focus on conducting longitudinal studies to monitor changes in QoL over time in children and adolescents with NF1. This approach would provide valuable insights into the progression of the disease and its long-term impact on various QoL domains, thereby allowing for the development of timely and effective interventions. In conclusion, our findings underscore the importance of conducting a comprehensive assessment of QoL in children with NF1, considering both patient and parent perspectives. By addressing the many challenges associated with NF1, future research and clinical practice can significantly improve the quality of life of these patients and ensure they receive the comprehensive support and care they need.",N/A,22 8 2024
"Long-term distress throughout one’s life: health-related quality of life, economic and caregiver burden of patients with neurofibromatosis type 1 in China",,"Around 260–450 million people suffer from rare diseases worldwide (<xref rid=""ref1"" ref-type=""bibr"">1</xref>). Neurofibromatosis Type 1 (NF1), an autosomal dominant genetic disorder with a global prevalence of about 1 in every 3,000 newborns (<xref rid=""ref2"" ref-type=""bibr"">2</xref>–<xref rid=""ref4"" ref-type=""bibr"">4</xref>), meets the definition of rare diseases in China, the US, and the European Union (<xref rid=""ref5"" ref-type=""bibr"">5</xref>–<xref rid=""ref8"" ref-type=""bibr"">8</xref>). NF1 is caused by an error on chromosome 17, which affects the development of multiple systems including skin, bone, eyes, nerves, and cardiovascular system (<xref rid=""ref9"" ref-type=""bibr"">9</xref>–<xref rid=""ref11"" ref-type=""bibr"">11</xref>). Clinical manifestations of NF1 vary widely, ranging from mild cutaneous abnormalities like café-au-lait skin spots to severe symptoms like benign or even malignant tumors within the peripheral or central nervous system (<xref rid=""ref11"" ref-type=""bibr"">11</xref>). Other manifestations of NF1 include headaches, learning difficulties, speech articulation difficulties, impaired executive function and attention, skeletal features, and other less common symptoms. The life expectancy of individuals with NF1 is 8–15 years shorter than the general population (<xref rid=""ref4"" ref-type=""bibr"">4</xref>, <xref rid=""ref12"" ref-type=""bibr"">12</xref>, <xref rid=""ref13"" ref-type=""bibr"">13</xref>). NF1 not only affects physical health but also causes a significant psychological and economic burden on individuals (<xref rid=""ref14"" ref-type=""bibr"">14</xref>). Roughly 19–55% of NF1 patients reported experiencing depression, while 15% reported anxiety at clinical level (<xref rid=""ref15"" ref-type=""bibr"">15</xref>–<xref rid=""ref17"" ref-type=""bibr"">17</xref>). Furthermore, NF1 impacts on adult patients’ incomes (<xref rid=""ref18"" ref-type=""bibr"">18</xref>) and places economic and caregiver burden on NF1 pediatric patients’ families (<xref rid=""ref9"" ref-type=""bibr"">9</xref>, <xref rid=""ref19"" ref-type=""bibr"">19</xref>). The disease burden among patients with NF1 in China is not well understood. Only one Chinese study reported the health-related quality of life (HRQL) of 27 NF1 patients (age 3–49 years), indicating that NF1 patients have impaired HRQL (<xref rid=""ref20"" ref-type=""bibr"">20</xref>). As innovative therapies for NF1 gradually emerged recently, there is boosting demand for comprehensive evidence of the burden of NF1 in China, which can support reimbursement decision-making of those therapies and the development of clinical practice guidelines. Since there is a lack of solid evidence to describe the landscape of the disease burden for NF1 patients in China, the present study aimed to measure economic and humanistic burden, including HRQL and caregiver burden of NF1 patients in China.   This study assessed the disease burden of NF1 patients using economic burden, HRQL, and caregiver burden in a nationwide sample that was relatively large and representative in China. For pediatric patients, the proxy-reported HRQL of children with NF1 and caregiver burden of their caregivers were estimated; for adults, self-reported HRQL was estimated. Treatments for NF1 vary according to the different clinical manifestations, leading to big differences in individual expenses. Surgery is the primary cost driver of patients’ economic burden in China because it is the main treatment method for NF1 (<xref rid=""ref56"" ref-type=""bibr"">56</xref>). However, the appearance of innovative drugs may change the landscape of NF1 treatments, and thus the main cost driver may change accordingly. More than 60% of NF1 patients had an experience of medical treatment away from home, also called off-site medical treatment, implying unsatisfactory accessibility of treatment for NF1 in most places in China. Since the study was conducted during the period of epidemic prevention and control of COVID-19, off-site medical treatment for NF1 patients was limited, therefore medical expenses could be underestimated compared with the actual demand. As for HRQL, children with NF1 had a lower EQ-5D-Y utility and EQ-5D VAS score than those of children with hematological malignancies in China (<xref rid=""ref37"" ref-type=""bibr"">37</xref>) but a higher EQ-5D-Y utility than of children with another rare disease, spinal muscular atrophy, in China (<xref rid=""ref57"" ref-type=""bibr"">57</xref>). As for NF1 adult patients, EQ-5D-5L utility was 0.843 ± 0.17 and EQ-5D VAS was 72.32 ± 23.49 in the present study, lower than the EQ-5D-5L norms of China, 0.912–0.971 and 82.9–88.3, respectively (<xref rid=""ref34"" ref-type=""bibr"">34</xref>). According to the <italic toggle=""yes"">post hoc</italic> analysis of the present study, NF1 pediatric patients in China had a lower HRQL compared to the published healthy controls although PedsQL total and scale scores were not matched for age and gender. Mean values of total scores and scale scores of NF1 pediatric patients are significantly lower than those of children as healthy controls (all <italic toggle=""yes"">p</italic> < 0.001) (<xref rid=""ref55"" ref-type=""bibr"">55</xref>). The effect size ranges from −0.54 to −0.83 (<xref rid=""SM1"" ref-type=""supplementary-material"">Supplementary Table 1</xref>). PedsQL scores of the healthy controls in the present study were extracted from the existing published literature which had the largest sample size and most similar age range to ours. PedsQL GCS total scores of healthy children in China ranged from 80.74 to 92.16, all higher than that of NF1 pediatric patients in the present study (<xref rid=""ref55"" ref-type=""bibr"">55</xref>, <xref rid=""ref58"" ref-type=""bibr"">58</xref>–<xref rid=""ref60"" ref-type=""bibr"">60</xref>). NF1 patients (aged 5–25 years) in the US had a PedsQL total score of 63.47 (<xref rid=""ref61"" ref-type=""bibr"">61</xref>), which is quite close to the result of NF1 pediatric patients in our study. For pediatric patients, both EQ-5D-Y utility and VAS scores and PedsQL GCS scores hit a trough at the age group of 5–7 years and reached the bottom at the age group of 13–18 years, especially in schooling and emotional functioning. One possible reason for the change of HRQL with age could be the deterioration of NF1 (<xref rid=""ref62"" ref-type=""bibr"">62</xref>, <xref rid=""ref63"" ref-type=""bibr"">63</xref>). In addition, children go to school initially at the age of 5–7 and step into adolescence and middle school at the age of around 13 in China. In these specific time frames, NF1 pediatric patients, especially those with visible symptoms such as café-au-lait skin spots and neurofibromas that affect their appearance, may suffer from social and emotional distress in school (<xref rid=""ref64"" ref-type=""bibr"">64</xref>). Similar patterns were observed in previous studies, including a study assessing HRQL of children with rare diseases in China using PedsQL GCS (<xref rid=""ref65"" ref-type=""bibr"">65</xref>), and a study assessing HRQL of Finnish children and adolescents using Revidierter KINDer Lebensqualitätsfragebogen (KINDL-R) (<xref rid=""ref66"" ref-type=""bibr"">66</xref>). However, different from our study, a study conducted among NF1 patients aged 5–25 in the US, using self-reported PedsQL GCS, reported that PedsQL GCS total scores of patients with different age ranges were 68.79 ± 19.06 (age 5–7, <italic toggle=""yes"">n</italic> = 78), 65.86 ± 19.86 (age 8–12, <italic toggle=""yes"">n</italic> = 97), 66.58 ± 23.30 (age 13–17, <italic toggle=""yes"">n</italic> = 64), 60.73 ± 21.34 (age 18–25, <italic toggle=""yes"">n</italic> = 66) (<xref rid=""ref67"" ref-type=""bibr"">67</xref>). The different patterns for HRQL along with age in pediatric patients may related to the various clinical manifestations and different cultural backgrounds. In the upcoming study, it is significant to incorporate diverse stakeholders, notably healthcare providers and educators involved with NF1 pediatric patients, throughout the entire process – from questionnaire design to study implementation to interpretation of the findings. No significant differences in HRQL were observed between females and males among NF1 pediatric patients, which is consistent with previously published studies that measured the quality of life of children with NF1 (<xref rid=""ref68"" ref-type=""bibr"">68</xref>). However, in adult patients, females were observed to have a lower PedsQL NFM total score than males while no differences between males and females were observed in EQ-5D-5L. Similar results were also observed in a study in Canada (<xref rid=""ref17"" ref-type=""bibr"">17</xref>). In adult populations with different health statuses, females were reported to have lower HRQL than males (<xref rid=""ref69"" ref-type=""bibr"">69</xref>–<xref rid=""ref73"" ref-type=""bibr"">73</xref>). Caregiver burden in this study, measured as ZBI total score, was higher than that of caregivers of neurofibromatosis type 1 with plexiform neurofibromas (NF1-PN) patients in the US (23.0 ± 13.8) (<xref rid=""ref19"" ref-type=""bibr"">19</xref>). The percentage of caregivers suffering from moderate to severe burden or severe burden in the present study was far higher than the caregivers for children with NF1-PN (<xref rid=""ref19"" ref-type=""bibr"">19</xref>). In our study, patients with or without NF1-PN were included irrespective of the treatments they received. In the study in the US, only caregivers for those pediatric patients who were treatment-naive or received treatment of innovative drugs were included. Whether the use of innovative drugs relieves caregiver burden of NF1 awaits further evidence. Unlike adults, children require continuous physical and emotional care from their parents. As caregivers of pediatric patients play a crucial role, we assessed their burden in the present study. Considering the feasibility, we did not include caregivers of adult patients. However, further research will be necessary to explore the burden on caregivers of adult patients, especially those with severe health conditions. The present study estimated the disease burden of NF1 patients in China using a relatively large sample size. The HRQL outcomes of this study can serve as a useful reference for populations sharing similar culture with China, especially those facing difficulties in acquiring substantial sample sizes for rare diseases. However, since the healthcare systems vary considerably across countries, applicability should be considered when referring to this study’s direct cost results. Regarding indirect cost, we did not directly assess indirect cost as monetary but reported it as work-loss days and school-loss days, which can reflect the severity of the disease and informal care demand from NF1 patients. These results may be useful for other countries. The present study had some limitations. In the present study, the HRQL tools for pediatric patients were proxy-reported versions. The proxy version of EQ-5D-Y showed agreement with the self-reported version in published studies (<xref rid=""ref74"" ref-type=""bibr"">74</xref>–<xref rid=""ref76"" ref-type=""bibr"">76</xref>). Although no significant differences in results were found between the proxy version and self-reported version of PedsQL GCS in many studies (<xref rid=""ref55"" ref-type=""bibr"">55</xref>, <xref rid=""ref77"" ref-type=""bibr"">77</xref>–<xref rid=""ref81"" ref-type=""bibr"">81</xref>), it was generally accepted that proxy version HRQL measures should be used as a supplement of self-reported ones when assessing HRQL of children because inconsistencies between the two versions of HRQL measures were shown in some studies (<xref rid=""ref82"" ref-type=""bibr"">82</xref>–<xref rid=""ref84"" ref-type=""bibr"">84</xref>). According to recommendations, the minimum age for self report of EQ-5D-Y or PedsQL GCS is 8 years. We finally employed the proxy version, after an in-depth discussion with the patient network, for a lot of parents of NF1 patients would conceal the diagnosis from their children out of concern that knowing the diagnosis may affect the children’s psychological health. In addition, there was no existing Chinese version of neurofibromatosis-specific measures for pediatric patients. Therefore, we can only measure their HRQL using generic measures, which may not be sensitive enough to capture NF1’s impact on HRQL. As for sampling, the population of the present study was recruited from a patient network through mostly online contact. Patients with extremely severe clinical burden or from outlying poverty-stricken areas precluded access to the internet may not be covered in the present study. The included study population covered adult patients who were able to complete the questionnaire and volunteered to participate in the study. Patients with rather severe clinical manifestations and unable to fill out the questionnaire were not recruited in the present study. Therefore, selection bias may exist in the present study and the disease burden may be underestimated. The study did not use a direct measure to assess the severity of NF1 patients since the survey was patient-reported while severity assessment tools of NF1 patients are clinician-reported and patients may not be clear about the nerve and bone symptoms if they did not get a regular check-up near the day of the survey (<xref rid=""ref85"" ref-type=""bibr"">85</xref>). The present study estimated the disease burden of NF1 patients using a relatively large and representative sample in China. Results of the study showed that NF1 patients suffered long-term distress throughout their life. The economic burden of NF1 patients, both pediatric and adult, varied widely due to the diverse range of clinical manifestations. The HRQL results were consistent between pediatric and adult NF1 patients, with both groups experiencing low HRQL, particularly in psychological dimension. Caregivers for NF1 pediatric patients had a considerable caregiver burden. More attention and support for NF1 patients are required.",N/A,21 8 2024
Traumatic arteriovenous fistula of the superficial temporal artery caused by massive subcutaneous hematoma prompting surgical removal and endovascular treatment in a patient with neurofibromatosis type 1,,"Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF-1) is an autosomal dominant disease occurring in 1 of 3000–4000 individuals with characteristic manifestations of café-au-lait spots, neurofibromas, and Lisch nodules.[<xref rid=""ref4"" ref-type=""bibr"">4</xref>] The major causes of death are malignant neoplasms and vascular disorders, including vessel dissections, aneurysms, arteriovenous (AV) malformations, and arteriovenous fistulas (AVFs), with the estimated vasculopathy rate of 0.4–6.4%.[<xref rid=""ref3"" ref-type=""bibr"">3</xref>,<xref rid=""ref11"" ref-type=""bibr"">11</xref>] Several mechanisms of vessel vulnerability have been proposed,[<xref rid=""ref6"" ref-type=""bibr"">6</xref>,<xref rid=""ref11"" ref-type=""bibr"">11</xref>] although they are still not fully understood. Here, we report a massive subcutaneous hematoma that resulted in the formation of a superficial temporal artery (STA) AVF in a patient with NF-1. A 40-year-old woman with NF-1 with a history of optic pathway/hypothalamic glioma underwent surgery with the right eye removal at the age of 3. She recently hit her left temple slightly on the corner of a PC monitor. Three days later, that area suddenly swelled, and she visited our hospital. She was alert without a neurological deficit. Head computed tomography (CT) showed a marked subcutaneous hematoma on the left [<xref rid=""F1"" ref-type=""fig"">Figure 1a</xref>]. The blood test, chest X-ray, and electrocardiogram were normal. Digital subtraction angiography (DSA) showed poorly contrasted distal left STA due to compression by hematoma in the early arterial phase of the left external carotid artery (ECA) on admission [<xref rid=""F1"" ref-type=""fig"">Figure 1b</xref> and <xref rid=""F1"" ref-type=""fig"">c</xref>] and minor extravasation near the contusion site in a late arterial phase [<xref rid=""F1"" ref-type=""fig"">Figure 1d</xref>]. Since the diameter of the vessel involved in the extravasation was too small for microcatheter navigation, and the hematoma did not enlarge over time, we expected it to resolve spontaneously. Four days after admission, the hematoma suddenly enlarged, preventing the patient from opening her left eye, and intraocular pressure increased to the point of causing blindness. Head CT revealed left eye deformation due to compression by the enlarging hematoma [<xref rid=""F2"" ref-type=""fig"">Figure 2a</xref>]. Thus, we performed surgical hematoma removal under general anesthesia to avoid bilateral blindness. After a small skin incision near the left temple, the hematoma was partially removed. However, no obvious bleeding point was detected, and the bleeding oozing from undefined locations was difficult to control. Therefore, we performed an endovascular intervention, considering it more favorable than surgery in terms of accuracy of vascular pathology assessment and avoiding excessive bleeding. A long 4 Fr sheath was placed in the right femoral artery, and a 4-Fr JB-2 catheter was advanced to the left ECA. The angiography showed a string sign in the left proximal STA, suggesting arterial dissection [<xref rid=""F2"" ref-type=""fig"">Figure 2b</xref>]. It was connected to a remarkably dilated vein (varix) draining to the facial and external jugular veins through the fistula [<xref rid=""F2"" ref-type=""fig"">Figure 2b</xref> and <xref rid=""F2"" ref-type=""fig"">c</xref>]. We replaced the 4-Fr sheath with a 6-Fr one, and a 6-Fr guiding catheter was advanced into the left ECA. Excelsior 1018 catheter (Stryker, Fremont, CA, USA) was steered just proximal to the STA dissection point, where a Target US 360 3 mm × 8 cm coil (Stryker, Fremont, CA, USA) was then placed with several additional soft coils to embolize the proximal portion of the STA. As a result, the varix, AV shunt, and drainage veins were blocked [<xref rid=""F3"" ref-type=""fig"">Figure 3a</xref> and <xref rid=""F3"" ref-type=""fig"">b</xref>]. Follow-up CT showed recovery of the left eye deformity without rebleeding, and the vision was preserved. Two months later, follow-up angiography confirmed no vascular abnormality recurrence [<xref rid=""F3"" ref-type=""fig"">Figure 3c</xref> and <xref rid=""F3"" ref-type=""fig"">d</xref>]. We treated a patient with NF-1 effectively using a combination of surgical decompression and endovascular treatment. In NF-1, hemorrhagic complications may be associated with vessel vulnerability. Mild injuries can lead to unfavorable outcomes, such as a life-threatening brachial artery hemorrhage requiring amputation of the upper extremity[<xref rid=""ref8"" ref-type=""bibr"">8</xref>] or a massive hemothorax without any traumatic episodes.[<xref rid=""ref10"" ref-type=""bibr"">10</xref>] Three hypotheses of vessel fragility mechanisms in NF-1 have been discussed: neurofibromas around vessels invade arterial walls, resulting in their weakening; an increased number of spindle cells in the vascular smooth muscle layer leads to vessel wall fragility; and neurofibromas exert compression on vascular nutrient vessels.[<xref rid=""ref6"" ref-type=""bibr"">6</xref>,<xref rid=""ref11"" ref-type=""bibr"">11</xref>] To date, there have been several reports of perioperative severe hemorrhagic complications.[<xref rid=""ref1"" ref-type=""bibr"">1</xref>,<xref rid=""ref8"" ref-type=""bibr"">8</xref>,<xref rid=""ref10"" ref-type=""bibr"">10</xref>] Raborn <italic toggle=""yes"">et al</italic>. demonstrated the efficacy of endovascular treatment of hypertension caused by renal artery stenosis in two pediatric patients with NF-1.[<xref rid=""ref11"" ref-type=""bibr"">11</xref>] Massive subcutaneous bleeding from a non-traumatic STA pseudoaneurysm in a patient with NF-1 was successfully treated using an endovascular approach.[<xref rid=""ref7"" ref-type=""bibr"">7</xref>] In our case, a mild head contusion resulted in a massive temporal subcutaneous hematoma, and DSA demonstrated AVF between the STA dissection and the varix. These vascular abnormalities were eliminated, and severe hemorrhagic complications were avoided with our approach. The laceration theory has been proposed as a mechanism of traumatic AVF formation.[<xref rid=""ref2"" ref-type=""bibr"">2</xref>,<xref rid=""ref9"" ref-type=""bibr"">9</xref>] Simultaneous laceration of the artery and the accompanying vein may have resulted in a single direct connection between the vessels. However, the uniqueness of the present case was that the AV shunt point (the proximal STA near the zygomatic arch) was far from the head contusion site and the massive bleeding point (the distal STA near the left temple). It remains questionable that simultaneous laceration of the proximal STA and accompanying vein could have occurred without direct traumatic impact or bleeding. Anatomically, there are <italic toggle=""yes"">vasa vasorum</italic>, which feeds blood vessel walls, and <italic toggle=""yes"">venous vasa vasorae</italic>, which originate from the arterial wall and drain into the main lumen or branches of the accompanying veins [<xref rid=""F4"" ref-type=""fig"">Figure 4a</xref>].[<xref rid=""ref5"" ref-type=""bibr"">5</xref>,<xref rid=""ref12"" ref-type=""bibr"">12</xref>] Here, we hypothesize that the STA stretching by the massive subcutaneous hematoma caused arterial wall laceration that could reach <italic toggle=""yes"">venous vasa vasorae</italic> [<xref rid=""F4"" ref-type=""fig"">Figure 4b</xref>], resulting in STA-superficial temporal vein shunt formation [<xref rid=""F4"" ref-type=""fig"">Figure 4c</xref>]. In NF-1, attention should be paid to vessel vulnerability, which can lead to serious consequences. Our case may be instructive in terms of hemorrhagic complications, where emergent and less invasive interventions proved favorable. We report a case of a massive subcutaneous hemorrhage that caused STA AVF formation in a patient with NF-1. Surgical hematoma removal followed by endovascular treatment was effective in preserving visual function. Since vessel fragility is characteristic of patients with NF-1, it should be kept in mind that vascular complications may lead to serious clinical outcomes. In certain NF-1 cases, less invasive treatment of vascular abnormalities might be favorable.",N/A,2024
Pathological findings in enucleated eyes of patients with neurofibromatosis type 1: report of a case with 15-year follow-up and review of 14 patients in the literature,,"Neurofibromatosis type 1 is characterized by typical skin lesions such as café-au-lait spots and nodular lesions.

 At the age of 5 and 6 years, he underwent three surgeries for orbital mass extirpation on the left side and cranial base reconstruction with titan mesh implantation. At the age of 7 years when he was referred for ophthalmic examinations, the best-corrected visual acuity in decimals was 1.2 in the right eye and 0.02 in the left eye. The intraocular pressure was 16 mmHg in the right eye and 23 mmHg in the left eye. The right eye was normal except for small iris nodules. He showed mydriasis (Fig. <xref rid=""Fig2"" ref-type=""fig"">2</xref>A) with sluggish light reflex in the left eye.

 Half a year later, he underwent enucleation of the phthisic left eye ball and extirpation of the subcutaneous mass lesion together with upper eyelid skin resection. The enucleation was done at first by circumferential cutting of the conjunctiva at the corneal limbus. The sclera and four rectus extraocular muscles showed firm adhesion with the surrounding tissues probably of neurofibromatous lesions. After the blunt dissection of the surrounding tissues which adhered firmly to the sclera and 4 rectus extraocular muscles, the eye ball was extirpated by cutting the 4 rectus muscles at the insertion and then by cutting the optic nerve. The conjunctiva was sutured to make the sac for future insertion of a prosthesis. The skin of the upper eyelid was resected in a crescent shape by an incision line below the eye brow to the lateral side, [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR26"">26</xref>] and the mass was carefully dissected from the pulsating and bulging interface to the presumed dura of the brain. The skin incision was sutured tightly to lift the canthal line on the left side in alignment with the right eye. He showed no operative or postoperative complications. The best-corrected visual acuity in the right eye was 1.2. The right eye showed small iris nodules (arrows in Fig. <xref rid=""Fig3"" ref-type=""fig"">3</xref>J) and the normal macular structure (Fig. <xref rid=""Fig3"" ref-type=""fig"">3</xref>I) with a suspected small choroidal nodule (Fig. <xref rid=""Fig3"" ref-type=""fig"">3</xref>K). The left conjunctival sac was fitted with a prosthetic eye. Family history for neurofibromatosis type 1 was absent. He and his family did not want a genetic testing for <italic toggle=""yes"">NF1</italic>. The resected orbital and eyelid lesions showed spindle cells with ovoid nuclei and ill-defined eosinophilic cytoplasm which were distributed in diffuse pattern (Fig. <xref rid=""Fig4"" ref-type=""fig"">4</xref>A and B).

Macroscopic view of a section of the fixed eye ball showed total retinal detachment in a funnel shape which was filled with white tissue from the optic disc to the posterior border of the calcified lens (Fig. <xref rid=""Fig3"" ref-type=""fig"">3</xref>G). In hematoxylin-eosin stains, no apparent neurofibroma was noted in the iris, ciliary body (Fig. <xref rid=""Fig5"" ref-type=""fig"">5</xref>A and B), and choroid (Fig. <xref rid=""Fig5"" ref-type=""fig"">5</xref>C) while neurofibroma was observed in close contact with the sclera in the episcleral location (Fig. <xref rid=""Fig5"" ref-type=""fig"">5</xref>B). The neuronal layers of the original retina were observed in a swirling pattern inside the cellular mass which was formed by total retinal detachment (Fig. <xref rid=""Fig5"" ref-type=""fig"">5</xref>C). The cellular mass of the totally detached retina was fully positive for GFAP (Fig. <xref rid=""Fig6"" ref-type=""fig"">6</xref>B) while the part of the mass in proximity to the optic nerve was positive for S-100 (Fig. <xref rid=""Fig6"" ref-type=""fig"">6</xref>C). The other part of the intraocular mass along the choroid appeared more fibrotic (Fig. <xref rid=""Fig6"" ref-type=""fig"">6</xref>A) and was negative for GFAP (Fig. <xref rid=""Fig6"" ref-type=""fig"">6</xref>B) and S-100 (Fig. <xref rid=""Fig6"" ref-type=""fig"">6</xref>C).

 The present patient showed typical features of neurofibromatosis type 1 from birth such as café-au-lait spots and hypertrophic thickened upper eyelid on the left side caused by orbital and eyelid neurofibroma. He was followed by the team of a plastic surgeon, neurosurgeon, and ophthalmologist. The plastic surgeon and neurosurgeon did volume reduction surgeries for orbital and upper eyelid neurofibroma for cosmetic reasons. The vision in the left eye appeared to be poor in childhood due to compression optic neuropathy with orbital neurofibroma. In ophthalmic examinations, he was checked to have normal vision in the right eye and stable condition of the left eye with poor vision. He had no signs of congenital glaucoma: the intraocular pressure in both eyes was within the normal range, and iris ectropion, as a sign of congenital glaucoma in patients with neurofibromatosis type 1, [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR27"">27</xref>] was not noted by slit-lamp examinations in the follow-up. In the process of 15-year follow-up, he was found to develop mature cataract and total retinal detachment in the left eye at the age of 8 years on the semiannual visit half a year after the previous visit. He did not notice any symptoms in regard to this abrupt change in the left eye. At that time, the reason for the retinal detachment remained basically unknown and would be attributed to incidental blunt trauma to the deviated eye or to suspected intraocular proliferation of neurofibroma. The surgery for the retinal detachment was not recommended because of rather old total retinal detachment in a closed-funnel shape which was revealed by the ultrasound examination. The pathological examinations of the phthisic eye which was enucleated almost 10 years after the development of total retinal detachment showed a mass lesion of massive retinal gliosis [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR28"">28</xref>] involving the detached retina. Massive retinal gliosis is a concept to show non-neoplastic retinal glial proliferation. [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR28"">28</xref>] Massive retinal gliosis has been described in a case as sequelae to retinal detachment surgery. [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR29"">29</xref>] In another case with the age at 22 months, total retinal detachment has been described in the background of neurofibromatosis type 1. [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR30"">30</xref>] In the present patient, the intraocular mass consisted of two areas from the viewpoint of immunohistochemistry. One area with involvement of the swirled detached retinal tissue was positive for both S-100 and GFAP while the other area along the choroid was negative for both S-100 and GFAP. The area positive for S-100 and GFAP is designated as massive retinal gliosis while the other area negative for S-100 and GFAP is a fibrotic tissue which would be formed by metaplastic retinal pigment epithelial cells or choroidal fibroblasts. In the enucleated eye of the present patient, no apparent iris, ciliary body or choroidal neurofibromas were found pathologically. The iris ectropion was absent. [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR27"">27</xref>] The episcleral neurofibroma in the patient would be the extension of orbital neurofibromatous lesions which surrounded the enucleated eye ball. The patient did show iris nodules on clinical examinations many years previously when the clear cornea allowed the visualization. The iris nodules would become atrophic in the many-year process of phthisis bulbi. On the visit after the recent surgery, he showed iris nodules as well as a suspected choroidal nodule in the right eye. In the review of other enucleated eyes in patients with neurofibromatosis type 1 which were reported in the literature, choroidal, ciliary body, and iris nodules were most frequent pathological findings (Table <xref rid=""Tab1"" ref-type=""table"">1</xref>). In the review of enucleated eyes in the literature (Table <xref rid=""Tab1"" ref-type=""table"">1</xref>), most patients were described to have congenital glaucoma in the unilateral eye, together with the hemifacial lesion which manifested as eyelid or orbital lesion or both lesions of neurofibromatosis on the same side. Their eyes became buphthalmic and painful and lost the vision, leading thus to the enucleation. Most of the enucleated eyes showed choroidal, iris, and ciliary body neurofibroma which would underlie the obstruction of aqueous humor outflow pathway in the iridocorneal angle of the eye. In contrast, the present patient did not develop a buphthalmic eye and he appeared to lose the vision by compression optic neuropathy by the orbital mass lesion with neurofibromatosis. He did show mild increase of intraocular pressure up to 23 mmHg in the left eye when he had already developed optic nerve atrophy. The enucleation of phthisic eye was described only in one patient with neurofibromatosis type 1 (Case 14) in the literature, [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR25"">25</xref>] in addition to the present patient. These 2 patients showed massive retinal gliosis with total retinal detachment as a common pathological feature, suggesting that the phthisis with total retinal detachment would be the background for this pathological presentation.",N/A,13 8 2024
Rapid postradiation malignant transformation of a pilocytic astrocytoma in an adult with neurofibromatosis type 1: illustrative case,,"A 32-year-old male with a past medical history of NF1 presented for evaluation of his previously diagnosed left cerebellar PA. The astrocytoma was diagnosed and initially managed at an outside institution and was incidentally discovered 8 years previously by screening magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain. After several years of observation, the lesion progressed, prompting multiple biopsies. The biopsies demonstrated mild hypercellularity with atypical astrocytic cells and rare Rosenthal fibers; there was no evidence of mitotic figures, vascular proliferation, or necrosis (<xref rid=""fig1"" ref-type=""fig"">Fig. 1A</xref> and <xref rid=""fig1"" ref-type=""fig"">B</xref>). Additionally, a Ki-67 labeling index of 1% was observed, and the tumor did not stain with antibodies to IDH-1 (R132H) and p53. These findings were consistent with the diagnosis of PA, WHO grade I. The patient subsequently underwent laser interstitial thermal therapy for lesional ablation. The postoperative course was complicated by brain abscess formation, requiring treatment with suboccipital craniotomy for drainage and washout, as well as antibiotics.

Intensity-modulated radiation therapy was administered at a total of 5400 cGy in 30 fractions, but the lesion rapidly recurred despite radiotherapy, with enlargement of the left cerebellar lesion involving the hemisphere and vermis, as well as new leptomeningeal enhancement. The patient was subsequently started on carboplatin chemotherapy, and the lesion remained stable with treatment for 1 year. However, the patient experienced another relapse, and carboplatin was restarted at a different healthcare system (<xref rid=""fig2"" ref-type=""fig"">Fig. 2A</xref>–<xref rid=""fig2"" ref-type=""fig"">C</xref>).

Additionally, a Ki-67 labeling index of 20%–30% and no immunoreactivity against IDH-1 (R132H) was noted. The patient initially did well postoperatively; however, he re-presented to the emergency department 3 months later with nausea and gait instability. MRI with and without contrast demonstrated diffuse leptomeningeal metastasis and enhancing lesions on the tectum and pineal gland, creating cerebral aqueductal stenosis with resultant obstructive hydrocephalus (<xref rid=""fig3"" ref-type=""fig"">Fig. 3A</xref>–<xref rid=""fig3"" ref-type=""fig"">C</xref>). The patient underwent ventriculoperitoneal shunt placement, and cerebrospinal fluid cytology confirmed leptomeningeal disease.

GTR of JPA is associated with low recurrence rates, with Dodgshun et al. reporting event-free survival of 95% and overall survival of 100% at 5 years postresection.<sup><xref rid=""bib17"" ref-type=""bibr"">17</xref></sup> Regarding the efficacy of GTR as a treatment for APA, Theeler et al. found progression-free survival of 179 months after GTR versus 79 months with STR, and Bond et al., in a meta-analysis of 415 APA cases, reported a significantly lower recurrence rate after GTR than after STR at 27% vs 73%, respectively.<sup><xref rid=""bib1"" ref-type=""bibr"">1</xref>, <xref rid=""bib13"" ref-type=""bibr"">13</xref>, <xref rid=""bib17"" ref-type=""bibr"">17</xref></sup> Therefore, achieving GTR over STR is essential to improving patient survival and reducing the likelihood of the recurrence of APA. Given this reported efficacy of GTR and our patient’s suboptimal response to radiotherapy alone, we recommended attempting GTR as the first-line treatment. Malignant transformation of PA has been associated with radiation therapy, as the majority of histologically verified cases of JPA anaplastic conversion have occurred following radiotherapy.<sup><xref rid=""bib6"" ref-type=""bibr"">6</xref>, <xref rid=""bib14"" ref-type=""bibr"">14</xref>, <xref rid=""bib16"" ref-type=""bibr"">16</xref>, <xref rid=""bib18"" ref-type=""bibr"">18</xref></sup> However, a potential confounder is the fact that radiotherapy is more likely to be utilized in adults, given the potential late complications of childhood radiation treatment, such as cognitive decline, endocrine deficiencies, growth delay, and vascular damage.<sup><xref rid=""bib18"" ref-type=""bibr"">18</xref></sup> Additionally, there may also be an association between radiotherapy and APA conversion to anaplastic astrocytoma. Ellis et al., in a study of 20 APA cases, demonstrated a malignant shift to anaplastic astrocytoma in 15% of cases, all of which occurred following fractionated radiotherapy or Gamma Knife radiosurgery (<xref rid=""tbl1"" ref-type=""table"">Table 1</xref>).<sup><xref rid=""bib18"" ref-type=""bibr"">18</xref></sup> Ultimately, larger studies are required to further support an association between malignant transformation of APA and radiotherapy, but given reports of this association, we recommend caution in utilizing radiotherapy with these patients and consideration of GTR instead. Moreover, our patient’s course was further complicated by his history of NF1, where PA is the most common intracranial neoplasm and typically involves the optic pathway.<sup><xref rid=""bib19"" ref-type=""bibr"">19</xref></sup> In comparison to non–NF1-associated PAs, NF1 PAs have a genetic makeup more similar to high-grade astrocytomas, and a non–optic pathway location and diagnosis in adulthood have been associated with worse survival.<sup><xref rid=""bib14"" ref-type=""bibr"">14</xref>, <xref rid=""bib19"" ref-type=""bibr"">19</xref></sup> However, the natural history of non–optic pathway gliomas remains poorly studied. Furthermore, patients with NF1 receiving radiation therapy exhibit a significantly increased risk of secondary tumor development.<sup><xref rid=""bib10"" ref-type=""bibr"">10</xref>, <xref rid=""bib19"" ref-type=""bibr"">19</xref></sup> Additionally, there are also cases of anaplastic conversion of PA in patients with NF1 who receive DNA-damaging treatment. Peters et al. reported the cases of a 14-year-old male with NF1 and an optic tract JPA and a 16-year-old male with NF1 and cerebellar JPA who both exhibited rapid malignant conversion to anaplastic astrocytoma after receiving alkylating chemotherapy (<xref rid=""tbl1"" ref-type=""table"">Table 1</xref>).<sup><xref rid=""bib16"" ref-type=""bibr"">16</xref></sup> Our study is unique in demonstrating malignant transformation in a patient with NF1 and APA. Currently, there is only one other case of NF1 in an adult with malignant transformation. Ryu et al. reported a patient with a hypothalamic APA, which progressed despite maximal chemotherapy, requiring 45 cGy of fractionated radiation (<xref rid=""tbl1"" ref-type=""table"">Table 1</xref>).<sup><xref rid=""bib14"" ref-type=""bibr"">14</xref>, <xref rid=""bib16"" ref-type=""bibr"">16</xref></sup> Four months after radiation, rapid tumor recurrence occurred with spread to all 4 ventricles. The patient’s tumor continued to progress despite further chemotherapy, and the patient died from the disease. These findings suggest a predisposition to malignant transformation in patients with NF1, likely due to the DNA damage from alkylating chemotherapy or radiation therapy, but this relationship requires further investigation. Therefore, we recommend caution when considering utilizing radiotherapy over resection for APA in these patients. Regarding treatment options, there is great interest in targeted therapies for recurrent low-grade tumors such as JPA. One well-studied treatment is selumetinib, which is a selective kinase inhibitor of the enzyme mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK or MEK) subtypes 1 and 2.<sup><xref rid=""bib20"" ref-type=""bibr"">20</xref></sup> It is approved for the treatment of plexiform neurofibroma in patients aged 2 years and older, but it is currently being studied in phase II clinical trials for the treatment of NF1-associated recurrent optic pathway and recurrent low-grade gliomas with promising results. Of the 25 eligible and evaluable patients, 6 (24%) had a partial response, 14 (56%) had stable disease, and 5 (20%) had progressive disease while on treatment with a 2-year progression-free survival of 78% ± 8.5%.<sup><xref rid=""bib20"" ref-type=""bibr"">20</xref>, <xref rid=""bib21"" ref-type=""bibr"">21</xref></sup> Targeted therapies such as selumetinib offer a promising treatment for patients with recurrent APA and may help to prevent malignant transformation. Our case report has significant limitations in terms of scope, but as there are few reported studies discussing this malignant transformation in the literature, our findings provide insight into the appropriate management of these patients. Future multicenter studies with aggregated patient outcomes may shed more light on this phenomenon, particularly as more targeted therapies are developed and reach clinical practice to treat recurrent APA.

However, no effective pharmacological agent has not been yet available for cure of the disease, and clinical management largely relies on surgical resection of tumors [<xref rid=""bb0025"" ref-type=""bibr"">5</xref>]. Clinical manifestation of NF1 patients include dermal neurofibromas, pigmented skin lesions, such as café-au-lait macules, and occasional skeletal abnormalities and cognitive disabilities [<xref rid=""bb0005"" ref-type=""bibr"">1</xref>].

Here, we report a rare case of ossified neurofibroma in a patient with long history of NF1, with literature review and discussions on potential etiologies. The work has been reported in line with the Surgical CAse REport (SCARE) criteria [<xref rid=""bb0035"" ref-type=""bibr"">7</xref>]. 73-year-old female with childhood onset of neurofibromatosis type 1 presented with right ptosis and eyebrow ptosis.

Her past medical history includes malignant lymphoma with complete remission, gastric duodenal ulcer, left lung abscess, atrial fibrillation, and about 20 years history of facial paralysis. Physical examination showed widespread nodules of various sizes on her face: on the forehead, eyebrows, eyelids, cheeks, external ears, nose, perioral skin and lips (<xref rid=""f0005"" ref-type=""fig"">Fig. 1</xref>A).

Microscopically, all tumors showed dermal, nonencapsulated proliferation of hypocellular bland spindle cells with thin, wavy nuclei with interspersed collagen bundles (<xref rid=""f0005"" ref-type=""fig"">Fig. 1</xref>B, C, D). Immunohistochemistry showed the tumor cells were positive for S100 (<xref rid=""f0005"" ref-type=""fig"">Fig. 1</xref>E). Pathological diagnosis was consistent with neurofibroma. Notably, in the right eyebrow neurofibroma, multiple ossified lesions comprising almost complete set of mature bone structure: bone trabeculae containing osteoblast surrounding adipose tissue, resembling fatty marrow, were observed (<xref rid=""f0005"" ref-type=""fig"">Fig. 1</xref>B, C, D). Neither massive immune cell infiltration nor foreign body reaction were observed in the tumor and around the ossified lesions. Cartilaginous tissues were not observed either. In addition, ossified lesions did not show atypia nor sign of malignancy. Collectively, ossification was considered metaplastic, and additional therapeutic intervention for the ossification post resection was not performed. The patient was discharged without postsurgical complications. Although musculoskeletal involvement of NF1 has been well documented [<xref rid=""bb0005"" ref-type=""bibr"">1</xref>,<xref rid=""bb0010"" ref-type=""bibr"">2</xref>], ossification of neurofibroma has been scarcely reported; our search hit only 4 cases of ossified neurofibromas in PubMed-indexed English literatures [<xref rid=""bb0040"" ref-type=""bibr"">[8]</xref>, <xref rid=""bb0045"" ref-type=""bibr"">[9]</xref>, <xref rid=""bb0050"" ref-type=""bibr"">[10]</xref>, <xref rid=""bb0055"" ref-type=""bibr"">[11]</xref>], other than this case (<xref rid=""t0005"" ref-type=""table"">Table 1</xref>).

One possibility is that the ossification might be the response to previous injuries, including surgical history, chronic inflammation and accumulation of stress, and tissue damage and repair over the years [<xref rid=""bb0055"" ref-type=""bibr"">11</xref>,<xref rid=""bb0060"" ref-type=""bibr"">12</xref>]. Another possibility is that the ossification stems from the differentiation of recently highlighted mesenchymal stem cell-like population, indicating their plasticity [<xref rid=""bb0055"" ref-type=""bibr"">11</xref>,<xref rid=""bb0065"" ref-type=""bibr"">[13]</xref>, <xref rid=""bb0070"" ref-type=""bibr"">[14]</xref>, <xref rid=""bb0075"" ref-type=""bibr"">[15]</xref>, <xref rid=""bb0080"" ref-type=""bibr"">[16]</xref>, <xref rid=""bb0085"" ref-type=""bibr"">[17]</xref>]. In heterotopic ossification (HO), bone morphogenetic proteins (BMP), including BMP2, which are members of the transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) superfamily, have been indicated to promote transformation of stromal mesenchymal cells to osteoblasts [<xref rid=""bb0090"" ref-type=""bibr"">[18]</xref>, <xref rid=""bb0095"" ref-type=""bibr"">[19]</xref>, <xref rid=""bb0100"" ref-type=""bibr"">[20]</xref>]. Although cell origin of neurofibroma is still controversial, some studies indicate the existence of the multipotent stem cell-like population in neurofibroma [<xref rid=""bb0065"" ref-type=""bibr"">[13]</xref>, <xref rid=""bb0070"" ref-type=""bibr"">[14]</xref>, <xref rid=""bb0075"" ref-type=""bibr"">[15]</xref>]. A recent study suggests that mesenchymal stem cell-like cells with osteogenic induction potential are more abundant in head and neck neurofibromas compared with those of trunk, perhaps associated with different levels of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) across tissue microenvironment [<xref rid=""bb0065"" ref-type=""bibr"">13</xref>]. The presented case underwent multiple surgeries for different locations such as subungual tumors and subcutaneous tumors of eyebrows and the right forearms, but the most recently resected one in the right eyebrow that existed for decades, was the only site reported for clear ossification. Thus, it might be consistent with the proposed mesenchymal stem-like cells predilection for head and neck location. The above-described possibilities are not mutually exclusive; indeed, considering that stress, aging, inflammation, and tissue microenvironment collectively impact recruitment and differentiation of mesenchymal stem cells [<xref rid=""bb0080"" ref-type=""bibr"">16</xref>,<xref rid=""bb0105"" ref-type=""bibr"">21</xref>], the etiologies can be the hybrid of the above-mentioned possibilities with complex interaction. Taken together, the ossification in neurofibroma observed in this case might indicate the differentiation plasticity of potential mesenchymal/multipotent stem cell-like population over the long history of neurofibroma undergoing tissue damage, aging and chronic stress. Further studies are warranted to further dissect the pathogenesis of ossification to identify novel therapeutic targets and develop effective therapeutic strategies to improve the quality of life for patients suffering from neurofibromatosis and ossification. Here, we report a rare case of NF1 patient with ossified neurofibroma. The bone formation over the long clinical course in neurofibroma provide insights on the pathogenesis of metaplastic ossification and potential differentiation plasticity of mesenchymal stem cell-like population.

Efficacy of Trametinib in Neurofibromatosis Type 1–Associated Gastrointestinal Stromal Tumors: A Case Report,"Trametinib, an MEK inhibitor, may offer a new therapeutic option for patients with NF1-related GIST.","Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) or von Recklinghausen disease is the most common autosomal dominant inherited disorder in humans, affecting approximately 1 in 3,000 individuals.<sup><xref rid=""b1"" ref-type=""bibr"">1</xref></sup> The pathogenesis of this disease is based on genetic alterations in the neurofibromin 1 gene, <italic toggle=""yes"">NF1</italic>, located on chromosome 17q11.2, which encodes neurofibromin, a tumor suppressor protein.<sup><xref rid=""b2"" ref-type=""bibr"">2</xref></sup> Despite our molecular understanding of this disease, its diagnosis is based on clinical features.

Here, we report a case of <italic toggle=""yes"">NF1-</italic>mutated advanced GIST treated with trametinib, a selective MEK1/MEK2 inhibitor, as part of BELIEVE trial. A 78-year-old woman presented at a local hospital with abdominal pain, vomiting, and diarrhea. The patient had more than six café-au-lait macules over 15 mm in greatest diameter and numerous cutaneous neurofibromas at age 40 years and was diagnosed with von Recklinghausen disease in a different hospital. Her second son had numerous cutaneous neurofibromas suggestive of von Recklinghausen's disease, whereas her parents and first son did not have any features or symptoms suggestive of the disease. Computed tomography (CT) revealed a volvulus at the ileum and a mass arising from the small intestine. Operative detorsion was performed as emergency procedure, and three neoplasms were found in the jejunum (5, 10, and 50 cm from the ligament of Treitz). One neoplasm (20 mm in size) was resected for histopathological examination. The tumor is composed of spindle-shaped cells with slightly coarse chromatin and long intertwined oval to elliptical nuclei. The cytoplasm was eosinophilic, and intercellular collagen fibers were not prominent. The cells often had small nuclei, but mitotic figures were not prominent. On immunostaining, the spindle cells showed diffuse cell membrane positivity for c-KIT and CD34, supporting the pathological diagnosis of GIST. The Ki-67 labeling index was low (<1%). One month after surgery, 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography-CT revealed accumulation in the neoplasms in the duodenum (maximum standardized uptake value [SUVmax], 3.2), jejunum (SUVmax, 3.0), and left chest wall (SUVmax, 3.4). The patient was diagnosed with primary GISTs and was referred to our hospital for chemotherapy. Comprehensive genomic assay (CGA) was performed using FoundationOne CDx. CGA identified a pathogenic <italic toggle=""yes"">NF1</italic> mutation (R1362*) with a 93.8% VAF and a <italic toggle=""yes"">KIT</italic> mutation (D816H) with a 1.1% VAF of therapeutic interest. Since imatinib is not effective in NF1-related GISTs and guidelines do not recommend its use<sup><xref rid=""b14"" ref-type=""bibr"">14</xref></sup> and given the previous reports on NF1-associated tumors treated with trametinib,<sup><xref rid=""b15"" ref-type=""bibr"">15</xref>,<xref rid=""b16"" ref-type=""bibr"">16</xref></sup> we enrolled the patient in the BELIEVE trial for the off-label use of trametinib, which was provided by Novartis. Trametinib 2 mg was administered once daily for 2 weeks. The treatment was initially well tolerated; however, the patient developed a grade 3 creatine phosphokinase (CPK) increase after 2 weeks. CPK increase was asymptomatic, but trametinib was temporarily discontinued, and the CPK level gradually recovered to grade 0. Trametinib was restarted with a reduced dose of 1.5 mg daily; however, the patient again developed a grade 3 CPK increase within 1 month. Prompt interruption of trametinib treatment resulted in a smooth decrease in CPK levels. Trametinib was restarted at a dose of 1 mg daily. The patient experienced grade 1 myalgia and grade 2 fatigue at 2 months and 6 months, respectively, after the start of treatment. The fatigue has persisted to this day, but the myalgia improved with about a week of observation and was considered tolerable toxicity. Following 4 months of treatment, CT showed a partial response (Fig <xref rid=""fig1"" ref-type=""fig"">1</xref>). The mean density on CT, measured in Hounsfield units (HU), decreased from 96.22 HU to 93.77 HU on the basis of the Choi criteria.<sup><xref rid=""b17"" ref-type=""bibr"">17</xref></sup> This response has continued for more than 10 months to date. Chest wall mass revealed no change in size throughout the treatment. All necessary permissions from the patient were obtained from the law and our institution to publish the images in <italic toggle=""yes"">JCO PO</italic>. All procedures performed in studies involving human participants were in accordance with the ethical standards of the institutional and/or national research committee and with the 1964 Helsinki Declaration and its later amendments or comparable ethical standards. A waiver from the requirement to provide written informed consent was granted by the institutional review board of the National Cancer Center. To our knowledge, this is the first report demonstrating the efficacy of an MEK inhibitor in a patient with <italic toggle=""yes"">NF1-</italic>mutant GISTs. Although a dose reduction was required, treatment with trametinib resulted in a tumor response with acceptable toxicity. Neurofibromin is a ubiquitously expressed RAS-GTPase–activating protein that acts as a tumor suppressor by regulating the downstream RAF/MEK/ERK pathway. GTP-RAS is converted to GDP-RAS by increasing the intrinsic GTPase activity, thereby inhibiting RAS signaling.<sup><xref rid=""b18"" ref-type=""bibr"">18</xref></sup> When neurofibromin is mutated, GTP-RAS accumulation leads to the upregulation of the downstream RAF/MEK/ERK pathway, resulting in either benign or malignant cell growth. PI3K/AKT, JAK-STAT3, and several other pathways are regulated by neurofibromin, providing therapeutic options for NF1-associated clinical manifestations. KIT and PDGRA are type III receptor tyrosine kinases, and <italic toggle=""yes"">KIT</italic> or <italic toggle=""yes"">PDGFRA</italic>-mutant GISTs demonstrate activation of downstream signaling pathways, including the RAF/MEK/ERK, PI3K/AKT, and STAT3 pathways. Wild-type GISTs are a heterogeneous group with various oncogenic mutations with different pathogenesis. NF1-associated GISTs rarely coexpress <italic toggle=""yes"">KIT</italic> or <italic toggle=""yes"">PDGFRA</italic> mutations, and the PI3K/AKT pathway is rarely activated. Our case uniquely presented with the <italic toggle=""yes"">KIT</italic> D816H mutation alongside the <italic toggle=""yes"">NF1</italic> mutation, which is located on exon 17 and is known for imatinib resistance. No mutations were found in exon 9 or 11 in this patient. There is currently no standard treatment for NF1-associated GISTs. Guidelines suggest treating imatinib-resistant GISTs with sunitinib when druggable mutations (<italic toggle=""yes"">PDGFRA</italic>, <italic toggle=""yes"">SDHs</italic>, <italic toggle=""yes"">NTRK</italic>, and <italic toggle=""yes"">BRAF</italic>) are not detected.<sup><xref rid=""b14"" ref-type=""bibr"">14</xref></sup> Sunitinib has shown survival benefits in patients with advanced GISTs after imatinib failure.<sup><xref rid=""b19"" ref-type=""bibr"">19</xref></sup> However, preclinical studies have suggested that activated forms of <italic toggle=""yes"">KIT</italic> mutants, including <italic toggle=""yes"">KIT</italic> D816H and wild-type <italic toggle=""yes"">KIT</italic>, are resistant to sunitinib and imatinib.<sup><xref rid=""b20"" ref-type=""bibr"">20</xref></sup> Regorafenib is another treatment option. It has been shown to improve the PFS in patients with GISTs after progression to imatinib and sunitinib. One case of NF1-associated GISTs treated with regorafenib was reported to show a therapeutic response<sup><xref rid=""b21"" ref-type=""bibr"">21</xref></sup> and warrants further investigation. MEK inhibitors are reported to be effective against NF1-related diseases. Selumetinib causes durable tumor shrinkage in children with NF1 and symptomatic inoperable plexiform neurofibromas (PN) as reported in the SPRINT study.<sup><xref rid=""b16"" ref-type=""bibr"">16</xref></sup> Thus, selumetinib is the first FDA-approved targeted therapy for NF1. In the MATCH trial, eight of 21 patients registered in the trial had <italic toggle=""yes"">NF1</italic> mutations. Stable disease was observed in one patient, but there were no reports of tumor shrinkage in the trial cohort. The difference in these two trials may depend on whether the <italic toggle=""yes"">NF1</italic> mutation was a germline mutation or somatic mutation. The MATCH trial included both types of mutations, whereas the SPRINT study recruited patients with germline mutations. We hypothesized that selumetinib is effective when the <italic toggle=""yes"">NF1</italic> mutation is a germline mutation. A preclinical study reported MEK inhibitor showed sensitivity to MPNST-derived cell line, whereas sporadic MPNST cell line did not.<sup><xref rid=""b22"" ref-type=""bibr"">22</xref></sup> Another phase II trial of selumetinib in combination with sirolimus in patients with NF1-associated MPNST (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: <ext-link http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink href=""https://www.clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT03433183"" ext-link-type=""uri"">NCT03433183</ext-link>) is currently ongoing. These findings suggest that MEK inhibitors can be used as rational treatments for NF1-associated conditions. Another hypothesis posits that partial inhibition of ERK may be sufficient for more indolent NF1 tumors to elicit response.<sup><xref rid=""b23"" ref-type=""bibr"">23</xref></sup> In one phase II trial where selumetinib was administered for pediatric glioma or PN, a response was observed in 40% of patients (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: <ext-link http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink href=""https://www.clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT03363217"" ext-link-type=""uri"">NCT03363217</ext-link>). The trial included patients with either NF1-related LGG or NF1-related PN. Furthermore, there is an ongoing trial comparing selumetinib with standard treatment for NF1-related LGG. One limitation of our study is that it was a single case report. A phase II trial of selumetinib for patients with <italic toggle=""yes"">NF1-</italic>mutated GISTs was once underway; however, it was withdrawn because of slow accrual (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: <ext-link http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink href=""https://www.clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT03109301"" ext-link-type=""uri"">NCT03109301</ext-link>). Further investigation of the role of MEK inhibitors in NF1-associated GISTs is required. Additionally, any trial targeting NF1-associated GIST should be conducted multicenter and possibly multinational, considering the rarity of this subtype. In conclusion, in this case report, a patient with NF1-associated GISTs treated with trametinib experienced tumor shrinkage with acceptable toxicity. Considering the scarcity of NF1-associated GISTs,<sup><xref rid=""b24"" ref-type=""bibr"">24</xref>,<xref rid=""b25"" ref-type=""bibr"">25</xref></sup> this case report suggests a potential therapeutic option for targeted therapy.",N/A,2024
Analysis of visual evoked potentials in patients with neurofibromatosis type 1: new concepts,,"Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF type 1) is an autosomal dominant disease characterized by typical clinical manifestations, such as café-au-lait macules, skin fold freckles, Lisch nodules, optic pathway gliomas (OPG) and neurofibromas (<xref rid=""ref1"" ref-type=""bibr"">1</xref>). The estimated prevalence of this disease in the general population is 1 per 3,000 inhabitants, making NF type 1 one of the most common genetic diseases in neurology and human medicine (<xref rid=""ref2"" ref-type=""bibr"">2</xref>). This condition is caused by an inherited or <italic toggle=""yes"">de novo</italic> mutation of the <italic toggle=""yes"">NF1</italic> gene located on the long arm of chromosome 17 (<xref rid=""ref3"" ref-type=""bibr"">3</xref>). The product of this gene, neurofibromin, is an essential tumor-suppressor protein that inhibits the activation of the Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK signaling pathway, which is involved in numerous critical cellular processes, especially cell proliferation (<xref rid=""ref4"" ref-type=""bibr"">4</xref>, <xref rid=""ref5"" ref-type=""bibr"">5</xref>). As a consequence of the mutation, the protein product of the <italic toggle=""yes"">NF1</italic> gene becomes inactive, resulting in excessive activation of the aforementioned signaling pathway that promotes cell division, which explains the increased incidence of numerous benign and malignant tumors in people with NF type 1 (<xref rid=""ref6"" ref-type=""bibr"">6</xref>). Given the widespread expression of the <italic toggle=""yes"">NF1</italic> gene in numerous tissues, it is not surprising that this disease is accompanied by a vast range of somatic, cognitive, and behavioral symptoms (<xref rid=""ref7"" ref-type=""bibr"">7</xref>). Visual evoked potentials (VEP) represent the application of visual stimuli to detect the electrophysiological response of the visual cortex, which is registered with the help of electrodes placed on the scalp (<xref rid=""ref8"" ref-type=""bibr"">8</xref>). There are two primary modalities of visual evoked potentials: (1) flash visual evoked potentials (F-VEP), and (2) pattern-reversal visual evoked potentials (PR-VEP) (<xref rid=""ref9"" ref-type=""bibr"">9</xref>). The latter method, in which a visual stimulus is displayed as a chessboard with alternating black and white fields, is mainly used in clinical practice with cooperative patients due to greater precision and sensitivity (<xref rid=""ref10"" ref-type=""bibr"">10</xref>, <xref rid=""ref11"" ref-type=""bibr"">11</xref>). After applying a visual stimulus, the information travels along the optic pathway to the visual cortex, where an electrical response is generated in the form of two negative (N75 and N145) and one positive wave (P100) that appear successively after 75 ms, 100 ms, and 145 ms (<xref rid=""ref12"" ref-type=""bibr"">12</xref>). Because of negligible intra- and inter-individual variations, the P100 wave has the greatest diagnostic value while assessing the integrity of the visual pathway (<xref rid=""ref13"" ref-type=""bibr"">13</xref>). Visual evoked potentials are traditionally utilized in patients with NF type 1 to diagnose and then monitor the progression of OPG (<xref rid=""ref14"" ref-type=""bibr"">14</xref>, <xref rid=""ref15"" ref-type=""bibr"">15</xref>). However, studies conducted by Taylor (<xref rid=""ref16"" ref-type=""bibr"">16</xref>), North et al. (<xref rid=""ref17"" ref-type=""bibr"">17</xref>), and Dilts et al. (<xref rid=""ref18"" ref-type=""bibr"">18</xref>) showed that pathological VEP can be found in as many as half of the patients suffering from NF type 1, which far exceeds the prevalence of OPG. On the other hand, the study conducted by Castricum et al. (<xref rid=""ref19"" ref-type=""bibr"">19</xref>) showed that altered VEP in patients with NF type 1 can be associated with cognitive deficits and learning disorders. Bearing in mind all of the above, it is without doubt that the role of VEP in the neuropathophysiology of NF type 1 is highly complex and needs further investigation. Our study aimed to analyze the diagnostic value of VEP in patients suffering from NF type 1, whereby two approaches were defined: (1) examining the differences in clinical manifestations between patients with normal and altered VEP findings, as well as (2) evaluating the correlation between pathological VEP findings and the severity of the clinical picture. Our retrospective study included a total number of 60 patients who were diagnosed with NF type 1 from January 1, 2012, until December 31, 2022. Inclusion criteria were: (1) a diagnosis of NF type 1 made based on the revised criteria of the international consensus group (<xref rid=""ref20"" ref-type=""bibr"">20</xref>), and (2) a carried out VEP analysis. The exclusion criteria from the study were: (1) a diagnosis of another disease with café-au-lait macules as a clinical feature (Legius syndrome), and (2) the existence of ophthalmologic disorders that could affect the validity of the VEP results (amblyopia and reduced visual acuity). Informed consent was obtained from all patients, and the study was approved by the Ethics Committee of the hospital. Data on the clinical manifestations of NF type 1 were collected for all patients by reviewing the medical documentation available in the Health Information System (medical reports and discharge letters for hospitalized patients). The VEP analysis was conducted in the Clinic’s neurophysiological laboratory using the PR-VEP modality. A CRT monitor was placed at a distance of 100 cm from the examinees, on which a chess board with black and white fields of size 20′, brightness intensity of 50 cd/m<sup>2</sup>, and contrast of 80% was displayed. The fields changed colors (black to white, and white to black) with frequency of 2 Hz. In the center of screen, a red dot was shown, and the examinees were obliged to fixate it throughout the examination. The displayed pattern filled the entirety of the subject’s field of vision, with visual angle values of at least 15°. Two modes of stimulation were used, monocular and binocular, and the entire analysis lasted 300 ms. Four electrodes (Oz, O1, O2, and Fz) were placed on the scalp of the patients following the standards of the 10–20 system. In our research, only the results obtained from the Oz electrode were observed. All technical parameters related to image quality were adjusted according to the recommendations of the International Society for Clinical Electrophysiology of Vision (<xref rid=""ref21"" ref-type=""bibr"">21</xref>). Before the statistical data processing, we defined the criteria based on which the patients from the examined group were divided into a subgroup with normal and a subgroup with pathological findings of VEP. One of the main characteristics of an abnormal VEP finding is the prolongation of the time until the appearance of the first positive wave, known clinically as P100 latency (<xref rid=""ref22"" ref-type=""bibr"">22</xref>). According to current recommendations, the sum of the mean value and 2.5 standard deviations is the cut-off value for a normal finding of P100 latency (<xref rid=""ref8"" ref-type=""bibr"">8</xref>). For these purposes, a particular control group was formed, which consisted of 50 healthy subjects who underwent VEP analysis at our Clinic. As the normal electrophysiological pattern of VEP is formed from age five and persists until age 60 (<xref rid=""ref11"" ref-type=""bibr"">11</xref>), the criterion for inclusion in the control group was an age greater than five and less than 60 years old. The primary criterion for exclusion was a diagnosis of ophthalmological, neurological, and psychiatric diseases that are known to adversely affect the results of VEP. After having analyzed the data collected from the control group, the mean value for P100 latency (during binocular stimulation) was 107.25 ms with a standard deviation of 3.5 ms. Using the formula, the threshold value for pathologic P100 latency was set at 116 ms. The first objective of our study was to examine the difference in the frequency of specific clinical characteristics of NF type 1 between the group of patients with physiological and pathological findings of VEP. All patients who, during binocular stimulation, had P100 latency values equal to or greater than 116 ms were classified into the group with pathological VEP findings. Remaining patients were classified into the group with normal VEP (<xref rid=""fig1"" ref-type=""fig"">Figure 1</xref>). Furthermore, 2 × 2 contingency tables were formed for each clinical feature of interest (Lisch nodules, neurofibromas, OPG, bone lesions, tumors, epilepsy, and cognitive impairment), and the difference in their incidence between the groups with normal and abnormal VEP was analyzed using the Pearson chi-square test of homogeneity. The second goal of our study included the analysis of a correlation between the prolongation of P100 latency and the severity of the clinical picture in patients with NF type 1. The Riccardi scale with four grades was used to evaluate and grade the clinical picture according to the severity (<xref rid=""ref23"" ref-type=""bibr"">23</xref>). Grade 1 (minimal NF type 1) includes patients with café-au-lait macules and skin fold freckles, while grade 2 (mild NF type 1) implies the existence of neurofibromas without significant somatic and neurological complaints. Grade 3 (moderate NF type 1) includes patients with more severe clinical manifestations (OPG, bone lesions, cognitive impairments) that reduce the patient’s functionality. At the very end, grade 4 (severe NF type 1) consists of patients with serious complications of the disease (pharmacoresistant epilepsy, brain tumors, and malignant tumors) that are difficult to treat and shorten life expectancy. For patients from all four groups, P100 latency values were plotted on the y-axis of the Scatter plot graph, and then the Spearman rank correlation coefficient was calculated. Statistical data analysis was performed in the computer program SPSS 28.0, with <italic toggle=""yes"">p</italic> < 0.05 for the Pearson chi-square test (for the level of freedom df = 1) and <italic toggle=""yes"">p</italic> < 0.001 for the Spearman correlation test taken as statistically significant. The demographic characteristics of the control and test groups were initially analyzed (<xref rid=""fig2"" ref-type=""fig"">Figure 2</xref>). The average age in the control group was 15.8 years (SD = 7 years), while the average age in the examined group of NF type 1 patients was 18.5 years (SD = 8.5 years). There was no statistically significant difference in age between examined and control groups (<italic toggle=""yes"">p</italic> = 0.07). For the gender structure, the control group consisted of 25 female (50%) and 25 male (50%) examinees, while the test group included 31 female (52%) and 29 male (48%) patients. In the further course of the research, we examined (1) the frequency of clinical manifestations of NF type 1, and (2) whether there is a difference in their distribution between the subgroups with physiological and pathological findings of VEP. All patients had café-au-lait macules and skin fold freckles; 67% of patients had neurofibromas, 63% had Lisch nodules, 33% had OPG, 30% had characteristic bone lesions, 50% had other tumors, 15% of patients had epilepsy and finally, as many as 37% of patients had cognitive disorders (<xref rid=""tab1"" ref-type=""table"">Table 1</xref>). Using the Chi-square test, the following results were obtained: (1) no statistically significant difference was observed in the incidence of neurofibromas, Lisch nodules, and bone lesions between the groups with normal and altered VEP findings (<xref rid=""fig3"" ref-type=""fig"">Figure 3</xref>), while (2) a statistically significant more frequent occurrence of OPG (<italic toggle=""yes"">p</italic> = 0.008), tumors (<italic toggle=""yes"">p</italic> = 0.032), epilepsy (<italic toggle=""yes"">p</italic> = 0.043) and cognitive disorders (<italic toggle=""yes"">p</italic> = 0.028) was observed in the group of patients with a pathological finding of VEP (<xref rid=""fig4"" ref-type=""fig"">Figures 4</xref>, <xref rid=""fig5"" ref-type=""fig"">5</xref>). The final data analysis level assessed the correlation between the prolongation of P100 latency and the severity of the clinical picture in patients with NF type 1, defined using the Ricardi scale with four grades. According to the mentioned scale, 18% of patients met the criteria for entering grade 1, 24% for grade 2, 22% for grade 3, and 36% of patients for grade 4 (<xref rid=""fig6"" ref-type=""fig"">Figure 6</xref>). Ultimately, the Spearman rank correlation test showed a moderately strong positive correlation (<italic toggle=""yes"">r</italic><sub>s</sub> = 0.665) between the prolongation of P100 latency and the severity of the clinical picture (<xref rid=""fig7"" ref-type=""fig"">Figure 7</xref>). One of the essential characteristics of neurofibromatosis type 1 is complete penetrance but highly variable expressivity, which means that the disease will manifest in all patients but with different severity in the clinical picture (<xref rid=""ref28"" ref-type=""bibr"">28</xref>). Bearing all this in mind, one of the most critical questions that our study tried to answer is whether the PR-VEP finding can serve as a diagnostic parameter based on which we will be able to predict, in the condition of significant variations in expressivity, the behavior of the disease in each patient with NF type 1. Initially, it is necessary to comment on the calculated threshold value for P100 latency, which in our study was 116 ms. Official textbooks and standards emphasize the necessity of calculating cut-off values for each population separately by summing the arithmetic mean values for P100 latency and 2.5 standard deviations (<xref rid=""ref8"" ref-type=""bibr"">8</xref>, <xref rid=""ref22"" ref-type=""bibr"">22</xref>). The obtained P100 latency value of 116 ms agrees with the recommendations given by Drislane et al. (<xref rid=""ref29"" ref-type=""bibr"">29</xref>), who advise that such a threshold value can be found in the reference range of 114 to 117 ms. The frequencies of clinical manifestations of NF type 1 observed in our study are comparable to the greatest extent with the data found in the available literature (<xref rid=""ref24"" ref-type=""bibr"">24–27</xref>). Compared to previous studies, neurofibromas and Lisch’s nodules occur less frequently in our study group, while OPG and benign and malignant tumors are more common. The observed differences in the prevalence of clinical manifestations can be explained in several ways. Firstly, the appearance of symptoms and signs of NF type 1 is age-dependent, which means that differences in the age of studied populations will contribute to significant variations in the frequency of specific clinical characteristics (<xref rid=""ref30"" ref-type=""bibr"">30</xref>). Secondly, bearing in mind that one of the criteria for the inclusion in our study was a VEP analysis, the more frequent occurrence of OPG can be attributed to selection bias. By analyzing the frequency distribution of clinical characteristics between the groups of patients with normal and altered VEP findings, we concluded that neurofibromas, Lisch’s nodules, and characteristic bone lesions (scoliosis, dysplasia of the sphenoid bone, and bowing of the long bones of the extremities) occur with equal frequency in both groups. On the other hand, a statistically significant higher frequency of OPG was shown in the group of patients with pathological VEP. This finding was expected because the literature has documented the prolongation of P100 latency and the reduction of P100 wave amplitude in people with this tumor (<xref rid=""ref31"" ref-type=""bibr"">31</xref>, <xref rid=""ref32"" ref-type=""bibr"">32</xref>). However, it is important to highlight several facts related to the diagnostic value of VEP when it comes to OPG. In our study, the prolongation of P100 latency during binocular stimulation was used as a criterion for qualifying VEP findings as pathological, resulting in a relatively low sensitivity of VEP in diagnosing OPG (SN = 55%). Suppose the prolongation of P100 latency during monocular stimulation, reduction of P100 wave amplitude below 5 μV, and altered morphology or complete absence of P100 waves are included as additional criteria; In that case, the sensitivity of VEP in detecting OPG increases to 90–100% (<xref rid=""ref14"" ref-type=""bibr"">14</xref>). Because of its extremely high sensitivity and better cost-effectiveness ratio, some authors have suggested that VEP be used as a screening method for OPG in patients with NF type 1 instead of magnetic resonance imaging (<xref rid=""ref15"" ref-type=""bibr"">15</xref>). It shows also superior results when compared to ophthalmologic examination (visual acuity testing), especially in pediatric population because of the lack of compliance and cooperativity (<xref rid=""ref33"" ref-type=""bibr"">33–35</xref>). Nevertheless, this issue is still a subject of debate, and VEP analysis is currently used in the follow-up of disease progression in patients with a diagnosis of OPG. In addition to the increased prevalence of OPG, in the group of patients who had a pathological finding of VEP, a statistically significant, more frequent occurrence of benign and malignant tumors, as well as epilepsy and cognitive disorders, was also observed. The increased frequency of altered VEP findings in patients with cognitive disorders is the most exciting result we have reached in our study. Although VEP is conventionally used as a diagnostic tool that assesses the integrity of the visual pathway, some modern studies have concluded that the finding of VEP can reflect the overall activity pattern of the cerebral cortex and that, as such, it can be considered a helpful tool that detects various disorders of higher cortical functions (<xref rid=""ref36"" ref-type=""bibr"">36</xref>). This should not surprise us if we consider that the main generator of P100 waves is the secondary visual cortex, in which visual stimuli are processed and integrated with impulses from other parts of the brain (<xref rid=""ref8"" ref-type=""bibr"">8</xref>). This visual field is located in the broader band of the associative parieto-occipital cortex, which, together with the prefrontal cortex, provides the anatomical substrate for a whole range of executive functions, including attention, memory, working memory, inhibitory control, and visuospatial orientation (<xref rid=""ref37"" ref-type=""bibr"">37</xref>). Disruption of these executive functions can be manifested clinically as a learning disorder in children of school age suffering from NF type 1. These learning problems can be classified as specific (dyslexia and dyscalculia) or mixed learning problems (<xref rid=""ref7"" ref-type=""bibr"">7</xref>). Based on animal models with heterozygous <italic toggle=""yes"">Nf</italic>+/<italic toggle=""yes"">Nf</italic>− mutation, increased GABAergic transmission in inhibitory interneurons of the hippocampus and striatum was identified as the main culprit for the mentioned disorders (<xref rid=""ref38"" ref-type=""bibr"">38</xref>). Namely, the activity of the ras/RAF/MEK/ERK signaling pathway is increased due to the loss of function of neurofibromin, which leads to the phosphorylation of synapsin and increased release of GABA from synaptic vesicles (<xref rid=""ref39"" ref-type=""bibr"">39</xref>). The consequence of this neurotransmitter‘s increased secretion is a disturbance of the balance between inhibitory and excitatory impulses at the CA1 zone of the hippocampus, which leads to a decrease in long-term potentiation and synaptic plasticity. These two processes play a vital role in memory and learning (<xref rid=""ref40"" ref-type=""bibr"">40</xref>). Further evidence that VEP can be used to assess the extent of synaptic plasticity is provided in a study by Castricum et al. (<xref rid=""ref19"" ref-type=""bibr"">19</xref>), which is based on the assumption that after the application of repetitive visual stimuli, there is a change in the response of the visual cortex to the repeated stimulus through an increase in the amplitude of the P100 wave, which is an electrophysiological correlate of the memory process (<xref rid=""ref41"" ref-type=""bibr"">41</xref>). Their research showed reduced plasticity of visual evoked potentials in people with NF type 1. Knowledge of complex signaling pathways and their influence on the central neurotransmitter systems enabled the introduction of new pharmacotherapeutic approaches. It is encouraging that, at least on an experimental level, it has been demonstrated that the administration of lovastatin (an inhibitor of ras protein activation) and picrotoxin (a GABA-A channel antagonist) can lead to a significant improvement of the previously mentioned cognitive disorders (<xref rid=""ref7"" ref-type=""bibr"">7</xref>). At the very end, a moderately strong positive correlation between the prolongation of P100 latency and the severity of the clinical picture in patients with NF type 1 indicates the possibility of utilizing the pathological finding of VEP as a predictor of the appearance of severe disease manifestations. To the best of the authors’ knowledge, our study was among the first to examine the possibility of such a correlation. We can interpret the results we have reached in the first place as an attempt to characterize a unique clinical phenotype of NF type 1, the main characteristics of which are an altered VEP finding and more frequent occurrence of severe complications such as malignant tumors, pharmacoresistant epilepsy, and numerous others. Another important implication is the possibility of including patients with a pathological finding of VEP and a complex clinical picture in modern therapeutic protocols where the drug selumetinib (a MEK tyrosine kinase inhibitor) is used (<xref rid=""ref42"" ref-type=""bibr"">42</xref>, <xref rid=""ref43"" ref-type=""bibr"">43</xref>). Although selumetinib is currently only recommended for patients with severe forms of plexiform neurofibromas, the future of research lies in the possibility of using this therapy for patients with a severe form of NF type 1. In this case, VEP analysis would be essential in selecting patients with a pathological finding that assumes the existence of benign and malignant tumors. NF type 1 is one of the most common genetic diseases in humans, characterized by significant variability in disease manifestations and the severity of the clinical picture. Our research examined the role of VEP in the diagnostic workup of patients with NF type 1. The results we reached showed a statistically significant more frequent occurrence of GOP, benign and malignant tumors, cognitive disorders, and epilepsy in the group of patients who had an altered VEP finding. It was also shown that there is a moderately strong positive correlation between the prolongation of P100 latency and the severity of the clinical picture expressed through the Riccardi scale. Bearing all this in mind, the authors of this study propose to include VEP analysis as a reliable and straightforward method in the diagnostic algorithms that will be used not only for the assessment of OPG but also for neurocognitive disorders and more severe forms of NF type 1. Finally, the results indicate the necessity of additional research that will determine the role of VEP in characterizing the biological behavior of NF type 1 in each patient in a more precise manner.
