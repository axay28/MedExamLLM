Cipaglucosidase alfa plus miglustat: linking mechanism of action to clinical outcomes in late-onset Pompe disease,"Enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) is the only approved disease-modifying treatment modality for Pompe disease, a rare, inherited metabolic disorder caused by a deficiency in the acid <italic toggle=""yes"">α</italic>-glucosidase (GAA) enzyme that catabolizes lysosomal glycogen. First-generation recombinant human GAA (rhGAA) ERT (alglucosidase alfa) can slow the progressive muscle degeneration characteristic of the disease. Still, most patients experience diminished efficacy over time, possibly because of poor uptake into target tissues. Next-generation ERTs aim to address this problem by increasing bis-phosphorylated high mannose (bis-M6P) <italic toggle=""yes"">N</italic>-glycans on rhGAA as these moieties have sufficiently high receptor binding affinity at the resultant low interstitial enzyme concentrations after dosing to drive uptake by the cation-independent mannose 6-phosphate receptor on target cells. However, some approaches introduce bis-M6P onto rhGAA via non-natural linkages that cannot be hydrolyzed by natural human enzymes and thus inhibit the endolysosomal glycan trimming necessary for complete enzyme activation after cell uptake. Furthermore, all rhGAA ERTs face potential inactivation during intravenous delivery (and subsequent non-productive clearance) as GAA is an acid hydrolase that is rapidly denatured in the near-neutral pH of the blood. One new therapy, cipaglucosidase alfa plus miglustat, is hypothesized to address these challenges by combining an enzyme enriched with naturally occurring bis-M6P <italic toggle=""yes"">N</italic>-glycans with a small-molecule stabilizer. Here, we investigate this hypothesis by analyzing published and new data related to the mechanism of action of the enzyme and stabilizer molecule. Based on an extensive collection of <italic toggle=""yes"">in vitro</italic>, preclinical, and clinical data, we conclude that cipaglucosidase alfa plus miglustat successfully addresses each of these challenges to offer meaningful advantages in terms of pharmacokinetic exposure, target-cell uptake, endolysosomal processing, and clinical benefit.","Pompe disease is a rare, inherited metabolic disorder caused by biallelic pathogenic variants in the acid <italic toggle=""yes"">α</italic>-glucosidase (<italic toggle=""yes"">GAA</italic>) gene, which encodes a lysosomal enzyme that hydrolyzes glycogen (<xref rid=""ref1"" ref-type=""bibr"">1</xref>). When GAA activity is deficient, glycogen accumulates in lysosomes throughout the body, most prominently affecting the heart, skeletal muscle, and smooth muscle (<xref rid=""ref2"" ref-type=""bibr"">2</xref>, <xref rid=""ref3"" ref-type=""bibr"">3</xref>). This leads to a cascade of cellular dysfunction in processes ranging from lysosomal function to autophagy and endocytic trafficking, culminating in progressive muscle weakness and degeneration (<xref rid=""ref4"" ref-type=""bibr"">4</xref>–<xref rid=""ref6"" ref-type=""bibr"">6</xref>). Depending on the level of residual enzyme activity, Pompe disease can present as either infantile-onset (IOPD) or late-onset (LOPD) forms. IOPD is the most severe form, resulting from complete or nearly complete loss of GAA activity. IOPD generally presents within the first year of life and is characterized by rapidly progressive hypotonia and myopathy, respiratory insufficiency, and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (<xref rid=""ref7"" ref-type=""bibr"">7</xref>, <xref rid=""ref8"" ref-type=""bibr"">8</xref>). Due to the severity of IOPD, Pompe disease is included in newborn screening panels in many countries, including 37 US states and territories (<xref rid=""ref9"" ref-type=""bibr"">9</xref>). Without treatment, IOPD has high mortality within the first year of life (<xref rid=""ref7"" ref-type=""bibr"">7</xref>, <xref rid=""ref8"" ref-type=""bibr"">8</xref>). LOPD presents later in life as a slowly progressive myopathy. While LOPD does not typically present with severe cardiac involvement, the progressive myopathy leads to respiratory insufficiency, resulting in substantial morbidity and early mortality (<xref rid=""ref1"" ref-type=""bibr"">1</xref>, <xref rid=""ref7"" ref-type=""bibr"">7</xref>). Enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) with recombinant human GAA (rhGAA) is the only approved disease-modifying treatment modality for Pompe disease. Alglucosidase alfa (Lumizyme®/Myozyme®; Sanofi) was the first ERT developed for Pompe disease. While the drug improves survival and initially slows disease progression in LOPD, efficacy wanes over 3–5 years of treatment, with many patients continuing to experience deficits in respiratory and muscle function (<xref rid=""ref10"" ref-type=""bibr"">10</xref>–<xref rid=""ref16"" ref-type=""bibr"">16</xref>). In response to these limitations, one next-generation Pompe ERT, avalglucosidase alfa (Nexviazyme®/Nexviadyme®; Sanofi) was developed using synthetic glycan chemistry to enhance cellular uptake (<xref rid=""ref17"" ref-type=""bibr"">17</xref>–<xref rid=""ref21"" ref-type=""bibr"">21</xref>). Another next-generation therapy, cipaglucosidase alfa plus miglustat (ATB200 + AT2221; Pombiliti® + Opfolda®; Amicus Therapeutics), was developed using naturally enriched bis-phosphorylated high mannose (bis-M6P) <italic toggle=""yes"">N</italic>-glycans and a small-molecule stabilizer to enhance both cellular uptake and stability while in the circulation (<xref rid=""ref22"" ref-type=""bibr"">22</xref>, <xref rid=""ref23"" ref-type=""bibr"">23</xref>). Over a decade of experience with alglucosidase alfa has demonstrated that the efficacy of this first-generation ERT is constrained by several key challenges (<xref rid=""fig1"" ref-type=""fig"">Figure 1</xref>), leading to suboptimal clinical outcomes and waning treatment effects over time. Based on these observations, it has become clear that improvements in ERT-based treatment options must start with developing an rhGAA with specific attributes designed to overcome these key challenges. The first key challenge is efficient uptake into target cells; as less than 1% of an infused rhGAA ERT reaches the interstitial space in muscle because of non-productive clearance by non-target tissues (e.g., liver, spleen), muscle cells are only exposed to ERT concentrations in the low-nanomolar range (<xref rid=""ref24"" ref-type=""bibr"">24</xref>). Thus, highly efficient uptake is required to internalize therapeutic amounts of enzyme into target skeletal and cardiac muscle cells (<xref rid=""ref25"" ref-type=""bibr"">25</xref>). Targeting motor neurons is also desirable; however, the blood–brain barrier prevents penetration of rhGAA ERTs into the central nervous system, and glycogen storage in motor neurons persists even after long-term treatment with rhGAA ERT (<xref rid=""ref26"" ref-type=""bibr"">26</xref>). We therefore focus our report on ERT targeting in skeletal and cardiac muscle. Cellular uptake of rhGAA is driven by the cation-independent mannose 6-phosphate receptor (CI-MPR; official gene name: <italic toggle=""yes"">insulin like growth factor 2 receptor</italic> [IGF2R]), a lysosomal delivery receptor that binds bis-M6P, a post-translational modification that is present on a wide assortment of lysosome-fated acid hydrolases. Bis-phosphorylated <italic toggle=""yes"">N</italic>-glycans, in particular, are responsible for efficient CI-MPR-mediated uptake, with approximately 3,000 times greater affinity for CI-MPR than for monophosphorylated <italic toggle=""yes"">N</italic>-glycans (<xref rid=""ref25"" ref-type=""bibr"">25</xref>, <xref rid=""ref27"" ref-type=""bibr"">27</xref>). As alglucosidase alfa contains, on average, only 0.1 mole of bis-phosphorylated <italic toggle=""yes"">N</italic>-glycans per mole of enzyme, the vast majority of the drug cannot be internalized into target cells at the low resultant enzyme concentrations after dosing (<xref rid=""ref28"" ref-type=""bibr"">28</xref>). Finding effective methods of increasing bis-M6P levels on rhGAA ERT (i.e., without impacting enzyme activity or processing) has been the subject of intense research and presents a viable approach to overcoming this challenge in cellular delivery. The second key challenge to an effective ERT is complete rhGAA lysosomal processing to allow for maximal catalytic activity. Following cellular uptake through CI-MPR, rhGAA is trafficked through the endocytic pathway and delivered to lysosomes. The single-chain precursor undergoes a series of proteolytic and <italic toggle=""yes"">N</italic>-glycan-trimming events in the endolysosomal pathway, yielding a mature enzyme with much higher binding affinity for its natural substrate, as evidenced by a 4- to 10-fold reduced Michaelis constant (<italic toggle=""yes"">K</italic><sub>m</sub>) for glycogen (<xref rid=""ref29"" ref-type=""bibr"">29</xref>, <xref rid=""ref30"" ref-type=""bibr"">30</xref>). Importantly, both proteolytic cleavage and <italic toggle=""yes"">N</italic>-glycan trimming are necessary for full activation after uptake, with either type of processing in isolation providing only a partial (approximately two-fold) reduction in <italic toggle=""yes"">K</italic><sub>m</sub> for glycogen (<xref rid=""ref30"" ref-type=""bibr"">30</xref>). These effects of processing on kinetics are observed only for macromolecular substrates such as glycogen and are not seen with the commonly used fluorogenic small-molecule substrate, 4-methylumbelliferyl <italic toggle=""yes"">α</italic>-D-glucopyranoside (4-MU-Glc), suggesting that proteolysis and <italic toggle=""yes"">N</italic>-glycan trimming remove bulky structures proximal to the active site to enable interactions with the large macromolecular substrate (<xref rid=""ref30"" ref-type=""bibr"">30</xref>). As only small amounts of rhGAA are delivered and internalized into target cells, it is essential that endolysosomal processing proceeds without interruption to yield an enzyme with peak lysosomal activity and therapeutic value. Unfortunately, some synthetic chemistries (e.g., oxime conjugation) that are highly efficient for increasing bis-phosphorylated <italic toggle=""yes"">N</italic>-glycans on rhGAA are also an obstacle for endogenous glycan-trimming machinery because the linkages that are introduced are very stable and there are no known human enzymes capable of hydrolyzing them (<xref rid=""ref30"" ref-type=""bibr"">30</xref>). These chemistries therefore prevent complete enzyme activation while also negatively impacting unprocessed enzyme activity through steric hindrance (<xref rid=""ref30"" ref-type=""bibr"">30</xref>, <xref rid=""ref31"" ref-type=""bibr"">31</xref>). Production of rhGAA with naturally increased bis-M6P has thus been proposed as an alternative method for enhancing delivery while preserving the potential for complete post-delivery activation and maximal glycogen hydrolysis activity. The third challenge in efficiently delivering rhGAA is its inactivation while in the circulation. Even with an engineered enzyme designed to address the uptake and processing challenges, an additional concern is inactivation before delivery to the lysosome. As GAA is an acid hydrolase, it is most stable under acidic conditions and is rapidly inactivated at neutral or alkaline pH (<xref rid=""ref25"" ref-type=""bibr"">25</xref>, <xref rid=""ref32"" ref-type=""bibr"">32</xref>, <xref rid=""ref33"" ref-type=""bibr"">33</xref>). This presents a problem for exogenously administered ERTs, which must pass through the near-neutral pH of the blood and interstitium prior to endolysosomal delivery. Denatured (inactivated) enzyme is rapidly eliminated from circulation through non-productive clearance mechanisms (<xref rid=""ref34"" ref-type=""bibr"">34</xref>), contributing to the inefficient cellular delivery of intravenous ERT. Small-molecule stabilizers that transiently bind to ERT but are subsequently displaced in lysosomes present an attractive solution to this problem and could enhance delivery by binding to and stabilizing rhGAA en route to the lysosome. Combining an enzyme designed for improved cellular uptake and retained capacity for complete processing with an enzyme stabilizer designed to minimize the inactivation of this enzyme in the bloodstream could help overcome the three key challenges that have thus far limited the efficacy of ERT for Pompe disease (<xref rid=""fig2"" ref-type=""fig"">Figure 2</xref>). The foundation of any ERT-based treatment for Pompe disease is that the rhGAA protein is able to efficiently enter target cells and the lysosomal compartment. Therefore, efforts to develop next-generation Pompe ERTs have begun with engineering rhGAA for efficient uptake into muscle cells. Cipaglucosidase alfa is a novel, bis-M6P-enriched rhGAA designed for increased cellular uptake through CI-MPR. The enzyme is produced in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells by recombinant DNA technology (<xref rid=""ref25"" ref-type=""bibr"">25</xref>, <xref rid=""ref35"" ref-type=""bibr"">35</xref>). To generate the stable cell line for rhGAA production, large pools of CHO cells were stably transfected with a DNA vector encoding wild type human GAA. Each transformed CHO cell contained a unique set of untargeted genomic transgene integrations, producing rhGAA with variable co- and post-translational modifications (<xref rid=""ref25"" ref-type=""bibr"">25</xref>). Nearly 1,000 unique rhGAA clones were isolated and screened to identify a clone with an optimal N-glycan profile, including naturally high bis-M6P content for enhanced CI-MPR binding. Since the cell line was generated using a transfection and selection approach based on untargeted (i.e., random) transgene integration, the precise mechanism for the bis-M6P enrichment is unknown. The selected cellular clone was expanded and a master cell bank was created for use in large-scale production of bis-M6P-enriched rhGAA. A specialized, proprietary, downstream rhGAA-purification process was also developed, which facilitates the highest possible bis-M6P content retention in the finished drug substance. Given the rapid inactivation of rhGAA at the near-neutral pH of blood and interstitial space (<xref rid=""ref25"" ref-type=""bibr"">25</xref>, <xref rid=""ref31"" ref-type=""bibr"">31</xref>–<xref rid=""ref33"" ref-type=""bibr"">33</xref>, <xref rid=""ref36"" ref-type=""bibr"">36</xref>), there has long been interest in finding a small molecule that can be co-delivered with rhGAA to stabilize the enzyme and enhance target-cell delivery. Miglustat (<italic toggle=""yes"">N</italic>-butyl-1-deoxynojirimycin) is an iminosugar that mimics the terminal glucose of glycogen, the natural substrate for GAA (<xref rid=""ref25"" ref-type=""bibr"">25</xref>, <xref rid=""ref37"" ref-type=""bibr"">37</xref>). Miglustat has been used in the clinic for decades in other lysosomal storage disorders (type 1 Gaucher disease and Niemann–Pick disease type C), acting through an alternative mechanism as a substrate reduction therapy at substantially higher doses to inhibit glycosphingolipid synthesis (<xref rid=""ref38"" ref-type=""bibr"">38</xref>–<xref rid=""ref41"" ref-type=""bibr"">41</xref>). In the context of Pompe disease, miglustat competitively and reversibly binds to the active site of rhGAA and has been shown to effectively stabilize cipaglucosidase alfa while in circulation (<xref rid=""ref25"" ref-type=""bibr"">25</xref>, <xref rid=""ref36"" ref-type=""bibr"">36</xref>). In a Phase I/II clinical trial (NCT02675465) (<xref rid=""ref42"" ref-type=""bibr"">42</xref>), a 260 mg dose of miglustat was shown to provide a good balance between GAA stabilization and inhibition while in circulation, particularly during the distribution phase of elimination of cipaglucosidase alfa from the systemic circulation. Accordingly, in Phase III studies and product labeling, miglustat is dosed orally (260 mg) once every 2 weeks, 1 h prior to cipaglucosidase alfa infusion. Fasting for 2 h before and 2 h after taking miglustat helps maximize absorption and increase binding to cipaglucosidase alfa while minimizing the potential for adverse events (<xref rid=""ref22"" ref-type=""bibr"">22</xref>, <xref rid=""ref43"" ref-type=""bibr"">43</xref>). Importantly, this 260 mg biweekly dose is substantially lower and less frequent than the doses used for treating type 1 Gaucher disease and Niemann–Pick disease type C. When acting as a substrate reduction therapy for either indication, miglustat is taken orally at 100–200 mg three times a day (<xref rid=""ref44"" ref-type=""bibr"">44</xref>, <xref rid=""ref45"" ref-type=""bibr"">45</xref>). By constraining dosing strictly to 1 h just before each cipaglucosidase alfa infusion, the potential for off-target effects is reduced when using miglustat as an rhGAA stabilizer. The 260 mg miglustat dose was initially selected based on translational pharmacokinetic (PK)/pharmacodynamic (PD) modeling and simulations from the Pompe (<italic toggle=""yes"">Gaa</italic> knockout) mouse model. In this analysis, the dose regimen of 260 mg miglustat (human dose equivalent) with 20 mg/kg cipaglucosidase alfa was predicted to provide approximately 18 h of binding and stabilization above the half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC<sub>50</sub>) in the systemic circulation, with only minimal (approximately 4 h) duration of binding in the lysosome (where the IC<sub>50</sub> is higher because of the acidic pH). This dose was therefore predicted to provide effective rhGAA stabilization in the blood while minimizing any potential for post-delivery inhibition in the lysosome. Importantly, the intracellular half-life of GAA once delivered to lysosomes is estimated to be nearly 5 days which allows ample time for the dissociation and clearance of miglustat to allow for maximal lysosomal GAA activity. The 260 mg miglustat dose was confirmed as an effective enzyme stabilizer in the first-in-human Phase I/II clinical study (<xref rid=""ref46"" ref-type=""bibr"">46</xref>). The impact of miglustat on enzyme stabilization is most evident for rhGAAs that are relatively rapidly cleared from circulation, such as cipaglucosidase alfa. The high bis-M6P levels with cipaglucosidase alfa lead to efficient uptake via CI-MPR, while a minor fraction of the enzyme is expected to be cleared by other carbohydrate receptors such as the hepatic asialoglycoprotein receptor, which binds terminal galactose on incompletely processed complex-type <italic toggle=""yes"">N</italic>-glycans. First-generation rhGAA ERTs contain a higher percentage of complex-type <italic toggle=""yes"">N</italic>-glycans and much lower bis-M6P content (<xref rid=""ref30"" ref-type=""bibr"">30</xref>), leading to slower clearance kinetics predominantly through non-target receptors. Denaturation of lysosomal enzymes in the neutral pH environment of the blood, resulting in enzyme inactivation and subsequent non-productive clearance, likely impacts the PK of both first- and next-generation rhGAAs. However, the impact of small-molecule stabilization is most apparent for enzymes with faster clearance, whereby there is a proportionally larger exposure impact from rescuing what would otherwise be an inactivated fraction of rhGAA (<xref rid=""ref32"" ref-type=""bibr"">32</xref>).  An extensive collection of <italic toggle=""yes"">in vitro</italic>, preclinical, and clinical data supports the hypothesis that treatment with cipaglucosidase alfa plus miglustat addresses the three key challenges of ERT for Pompe disease. By combining a bis-M6P-enriched enzyme that retains the capacity for complete processing with an enzyme stabilizer designed to minimize rhGAA inactivation during delivery, the combination therapy offers distinct advantages over existing ERTs, ultimately leading to improved outcomes for individuals living with LOPD (<xref rid=""fig14"" ref-type=""fig"">Figure 14</xref>). Several therapeutic modalities are under investigation for Pompe disease, including substrate reduction therapy (<xref rid=""ref58"" ref-type=""bibr"">58</xref>) and gene therapy (<xref rid=""ref59"" ref-type=""bibr"">59</xref>–<xref rid=""ref61"" ref-type=""bibr"">61</xref>), but ERT is the only approved therapy. Although clinical benefits have been attained in patients treated with alglucosidase alfa, the limited capacity for CI-MPR-mediated cellular uptake likely leads to declining efficacy over the long term (i.e., 3–5 years) (<xref rid=""ref10"" ref-type=""bibr"">10</xref>–<xref rid=""ref13"" ref-type=""bibr"">13</xref>), illustrating the need for more efficacious therapies. One newer ERT, avalglucosidase alfa, was developed to address the declining efficacy of ERT by using oxime chemistry to conjugate synthetic bis-M6P glycans onto rhGAA <italic toggle=""yes"">N</italic>-glycans to improve affinity for the CI-MPR (<xref rid=""ref62"" ref-type=""bibr"">62</xref>). In a Phase III randomized trial (NCT02782741), treatment with avalglucosidase alfa led to improvements in some clinical outcomes compared with alglucosidase alfa in ERT-naïve patients (<xref rid=""ref63"" ref-type=""bibr"">63</xref>), suggesting that addressing one of the limitations of rhGAA ERT (i.e., cellular uptake) can lead to beneficial downstream effects. Cipaglucosidase alfa is the latest rhGAA to gain regulatory approval for LOPD and was developed with a different approach. Rather than using oxime chemistry to conjugate synthetic bis-M6P to rhGAA <italic toggle=""yes"">N</italic>-glycans, cipaglucosidase alfa is naturally produced from CHO cells selected for optimal rhGAA <italic toggle=""yes"">N</italic>-glycan profiles that include high levels of bis-M6P (<xref rid=""ref25"" ref-type=""bibr"">25</xref>). Several lines of evidence support a benefit for naturally produced rhGAA versus rhGAA with synthetically modified glycans (<xref rid=""ref30"" ref-type=""bibr"">30</xref>, <xref rid=""ref31"" ref-type=""bibr"">31</xref>). While synthetic bis-M6P can increase receptor binding, synthetic glycan conjugation also impairs the GAA processing that is required to attain optimal enzyme activity towards its natural substrate, glycogen, likely because of steric hindrance from bulky glycans near the active site of the enzyme (<xref rid=""ref31"" ref-type=""bibr"">31</xref>). Furthermore, for naturally produced rhGAAs, <italic toggle=""yes"">N</italic>-glycans are removed following administration (in the endolysosomal pathway), resulting in a mature enzyme with a four- to 10-fold improvement in affinity and optimal enzyme activity for hydrolyzing glycogen (<xref rid=""ref29"" ref-type=""bibr"">29</xref>, <xref rid=""ref30"" ref-type=""bibr"">30</xref>). This critically important GAA maturation process is blocked by incorporation of synthetic oxime bonds, resulting in an impairment of catalytic efficiency (<xref rid=""ref30"" ref-type=""bibr"">30</xref>). Preservation of normal post-delivery processing is thus an important advantage for cipaglucosidase alfa as efficient lysosomal kinetics maximize the potential for glycogen clearance. In addition to the benefits imparted by increased bis-M6P and retained <italic toggle=""yes"">N</italic>-glycan processing, the combination therapy of cipaglucosidase alfa plus miglustat also addresses the third limitation of ERT for LOPD by stabilizing the enzyme while in circulation, preventing inactivation. In mice, non-human primates, and adult individuals living with Pompe disease, miglustat increases plasma exposure (AUC) of cipaglucosidase alfa (<xref rid=""ref25"" ref-type=""bibr"">25</xref>, <xref rid=""ref47"" ref-type=""bibr"">47</xref>). In <italic toggle=""yes"">Gaa</italic> −/− mice, this increased exposure, while lower than that observed in humans, results in higher clearance of skeletal muscle glycogen and greater increases in muscle strength for cipaglucosidase alfa plus miglustat versus cipaglucosidase alfa alone, supporting a direct benefit for target-cell pathology. Notably, cipaglucosidase alfa plus miglustat is the first approved ERT to utilize a small-molecule stabilizer to address the challenge of enzyme stability during and immediately after administration (<xref rid=""ref64"" ref-type=""bibr"">64</xref>). Overall, the novel mechanism of action of cipaglucosidase alfa plus miglustat has led to significant improvements in clinical responses in adults with LOPD, both in the Phase III PROPEL trial and throughout an ongoing extension trial for at least 2 years of total follow-up, in which analyses have demonstrated prolonged stability or improvement in key efficacy and safety outcomes both in patients treated with cipaglucosidase alfa plus miglustat and in those switched at 52 weeks from alglucosidase alfa to cipaglucosidase alfa plus miglustat (<xref rid=""ref57"" ref-type=""bibr"">57</xref>). Beneficial treatment effects were also maintained in another long-term study, wherein patients treated with cipaglucosidase alfa plus miglustat experienced durable stabilization or improvement of motor and respiratory function and biomarker levels for up to 48 months of follow-up (<xref rid=""ref46"" ref-type=""bibr"">46</xref>). This is in contrast to the 97-week follow-up data for avalglucosidase alfa, which revealed late declines in nearly every functional endurance and motor function outcome (e.g., upper- and lower-extremity handheld dynamometry, 6MWD, quick motor function test) despite earlier improvements upon initiation of treatment (<xref rid=""ref65"" ref-type=""bibr"">65</xref>). While the extent to which these disparate long-term results are due to structural glycan differences, disparities in capacity for processing, or the presence/absence of a small-molecule stabilizer is unclear, the durability of the positive clinical outcomes for cipaglucosidase alfa plus miglustat supports the notion that the improved mechanism of action leads to tangible clinical benefits. In the absence of head-to-head trials comparing avalglucosidase alfa with cipaglucosidase alfa plus miglustat, indirect treatment comparisons have been conducted, with conflicting results (<xref rid=""ref66"" ref-type=""bibr"">66</xref>, <xref rid=""ref67"" ref-type=""bibr"">67</xref>). More clinical experience and real-world evidence will be necessary to fully demonstrate the strengths and limitations of each Pompe ERT. Nevertheless, a large body of <italic toggle=""yes"">in vitro</italic>, preclinical, and clinical evidence supports the hypothesis that treatment with a naturally bis-M6P-enriched rhGAA in combination with an enzyme stabilizer (i.e., cipaglucosidase alfa plus miglustat) can effectively address the three key challenges faced when treating Pompe disease with ERT.",N/A,18 10 2024
"Measurement properties of the EQ-5D-3L, EQ-5D-5L, and SF-6Dv2 in patients with late-onset Pompe disease",,"Generic preference-based measures (PBMs), such as EQ-5D and SF-6D, are widely used to measure health related quality of life (HRQoL) in different patient groups worldwide [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR1"">1</xref>, <xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR2"">2</xref>]. Unlike condition-specific PBMs, generic PBMs are intended for use across conditions and treatments and to provide consistency and comparability for economic evaluations [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR3"">3</xref>]. However, evidence for their use in rare disease populations is limited. In 2020, NICE’s methods review for HRQoL highlighted that there is insufficient published literature to provide evidence about the performance of the EQ-5D and other generic PBMs in rare and ultra-rare diseases [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR4"">4</xref>]. This can pose a problem when using EQ-5D [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR5"">5</xref>, <xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR6"">6</xref>] or SF-6Dv2 [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR7"">7</xref>] to support economic evaluations of treatments for rare diseases. The EQ-5D has both a 3-level (3L) and a 5-level (5L) version [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR5"">5</xref>, <xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR6"">6</xref>], while the SF-6D has an updated version (SF-6Dv2) [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR7"">7</xref>]. All these versions can generate a summarized utility score for calculating QALYs and use in cost-utility analysis for informing resource allocation decision-making [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR8"">8</xref>]. Studies comparing the measurement performance of various PBMs for different diseases have been widely reported [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR9"">9</xref>–<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR12"">12</xref>]. For example, studies have shown that the 5L has improved sensitivity and discriminatory power compared to the 3L, and that ceiling effects are reduced [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR13"">13</xref>, <xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR14"">14</xref>]. Other studies have indicated that there is a significant difference between EQ-5D and SF-6Dv2, including that the descriptive system of SF-6D is more accurate than EQ-5D in specific patient groups [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR15"">15</xref>]. The discriminatory power of 5L and SF-6Dv2 in different health indicators varies [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR16"">16</xref>, <xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR17"">17</xref>]. Pompe disease (PD) is a rare genetic metabolic myopathy also known as glycogen storage disease type II, with an estimated incidence of 1 in 40,000 births [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR18"">18</xref>]. PD results from a deficiency of an enzyme called acid alpha-glucosidase, which breaks down complex sugars in the body. This buildup occurs in organs and tissues, especially in muscles, causing them to break down. PD has two types: early-onset PD, which appears within a few months of birth, and late-onset PD, which appears later in a child’s life, or even into the teen years or adulthood. Those with early-onset PD rarely live past the age of 18 months, while patients with late-onset PD may survive up to the age of 30 years. If it starts in adulthood, they can live up to 50 years of age. Patients with PD usually have skeletal and/or respiratory muscle weakness, as well as symptoms such as pain and fatigue. Most eventually become wheelchair-bound or require respiratory support [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR18"">18</xref>]. The resulting impact of PD on their HRQoL is substantial. Assessing HRQoL can provide insight into identifying health needs, improving quality of care, understanding of medical needs, and monitoring of progress from a patient-centred perspective in rare disease care [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR19"">19</xref>, <xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR20"">20</xref>]. However, few studies have evaluated the impact of symptoms and side effects on the HRQoL of patients with PD. An international survey of PD patients found that participants from the United Kingdom had significantly lower vitality scores but much higher scores in perceived general health than patients from America, Australia, Germany, and the Netherlands [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR21"">21</xref>, <xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR22"">22</xref>]. Chen et al. indicated that adult Chinese patients with late-on PD had a lower physical HRQoL compared to their counterparts with other rare diseases [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR23"">23</xref>]. Given the international and intercultural variations, it is important to investigate the HRQoL of PD patients in specific cultures and social environments of interest. Evidence about the psychometric properties of the 3L, 5L, and SF-6Dv2 in patients with rare diseases, including PD, is scarce. A study conducted in the UK showed that 3L and SF-6Dv1 are suitable instruments for use in patients with PD, but they are not considered excellent [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR15"">15</xref>]. However, there are no studies regarding the use of these PBMs in Asian populations. The lack of evidence hinders the use of these PBMs to generate the evidence needed by policy makers, researchers, and professionals for informed resource allocation. Therefore, this study primarily aimed to evaluate the psychometric properties of the 3L, 5L, and SF-6Dv2 in a group of patients with PD in China. The secondary aim was to compare the performance of these three measures in this patient group. With the revision of China’s orphan drug development practice [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR24"">24</xref>], the importance of using a valid measure to examine HRQoL in this population is increasingly recognized by researchers and clinical professionals.   In this study, we found 5L demonstrates lower ceiling and floor effects, higher discriminant ability, and better convergent validity than the SF-6Dv2 and 3L for measuring HRQoL in patients with PD, a rare glycogen storage disease. This is the first study to head-to-head compare utility scores for the three most widely used PBMs in a patient population with a rare disease. These findings provide empirical evidence for selecting these generic PBMs to evaluate treatment and policies aiming at improving the HRQoL for patients with PD. In the present study, no measures showed significant ceiling or floor effects. However, a lower proportion of patients reported full health status using 5L than using 3L, but higher than using SF-6Dv2. Compared to studies examining the measurement properties of the EQ-5D in other rare diseases, the ceiling and floor effects of 3L, 5L, and SF-6Dv2 in PD were much lower than in previous studies of Duchenne muscular dystrophy [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR34"">34</xref>], haemophilia [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR35"">35</xref>], and spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR36"">36</xref>]. Both EQ-5D and SF-6Dv2 showed a good convergent validity, and the improvement from 3 to 5L is significant in terms of the strength of association between EQ-5D dimensions and WHODAS item. This is partially consistent with previous findings that the improvement of convergent validity of 3L to 5L is significant but only to a limited extent [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR9"">9</xref>, <xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR37"">37</xref>–<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR40"">40</xref>]. Currently, no PD-specific HRQoL instrument exists. Therefore, in this study, we selected the WHODAS, which is recommended in clinical practice guidelines for measuring functioning in patients with PD or other glycogen storage diseases [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR41"">41</xref>, <xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR42"">42</xref>]. However, it is worth considering the inclusion of other instruments to assess the convergent validity of EQ-5D and SF-6Dv2 in this population. This is because some domains that affect HRQoL for patients with PD are missing in the WHODAS-12 (e.g., no dimension to measure pain). In addition, 5L also demonstrated a stronger discriminant power than the 3L and SF-6Dv2, which is in line with previous findings in individuals with chronic low back pain [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR43"">43</xref>]. Previous studies have confirmed that 5L has higher discriminant validity than the SF-6Dv1 estimated based on SF-12 in patients with haemophilia [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR35"">35</xref>] or spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR36"">36</xref>]. Therefore, our study provides very first evidence on the relative validity or efficiency of the EQ-5D and SF-6Dv2 in patients with a relatively severe rare disease. In addition, another finding from the known-group validity analysis is that the mean difference between subgroups is consistently the largest with the 5L. For example, in patients using a wheelchair, the mean utility with the 5L is 0.06, while in those who have never used it, it is 0.56, resulting in a difference of 0.50. In comparison, the mean difference for the 3L is only 0.23, and for the SF-6Dv2, it is 0.29. This may suggest that in cost-effectiveness analyses, the utility gain is likely to be larger for the 5L than for the other two measures. Our study demonstrated that both EQ-5D and SF-6Dv2 have good test–retest reliability. A previous study targeting cancer patients reported a stronger test–retest reliability of EQ-5D with a shorter time interval [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR37"">37</xref>]. Both Gwet’s AC and ICC suggested that 3L is more reliable than 5L and SF-6Dv2, which is different from most of previous studies that 5L performed better than 3L or SF-6D [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR14"">14</xref>, <xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR44"">44</xref>–<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR46"">46</xref>]. However, none of those studies were conducted in patients with a genetic rare disease. Our results may suggest that 5L is not more reliable than 3L for assessing patients with rare diseases. However, it is possible that the better test–retest result of 3L is false. If the health status of patients with rare disease was highly unstable, and the health status at the retest actually changed, the higher agreement between test and retest 3L scores would be due to the insensitivity of the scale. Hence, future investigators of test–retest assessments of HRQoL scales in patients with rare disease may consider using a shorter test–retest duration such as 2–3 days. It is worth noting that in this study, there is insufficient evidence of the measurement properties of pain/discomfort as measured by the EQ-5D and pain as measured by the SF-6Dv2, since there are no corresponding pain or discomfort items in the WHODAS-12. Pain is a common symptom of PD, and in this study, most patients reported experiencing pain to some degree. Our findings are consistent with a previous study that indicated patients tend to inconsistently report their pain/discomfort using the EQ-5D [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR47"">47</xref>]. In our study, the pain/discomfort dimension showed worse test–retest reliability than most other dimensions of the EQ-5D. However, for SF-6Dv2, the test–retest reliability of item “pain” is better than most other items, which may suggest that the discomfort part of the pain/discomfort dimension of the EQ-5D reduces the measurement properties of such instrument, as partially reported by various studies [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR47"">47</xref>–<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR49"">49</xref>]. Given that patients with rare diseases are more likely to experience different types of pain or discomfort than the general population or patients with common diseases, and there are more than 100 different forms of discomfort identified, it is worthwhile to further assess the content validity of these concepts in this population. Several limitations should be considered when interpreting the findings of this study. First, the sample was recruited from a volunteer pool via a patient organization’s internal network. These volunteers may be those patients in better health, which could have induced selection bias. Second, all questionnaires were self-reported by patients with PD, which may lead to recall bias. Third, although online surveys are commonly used in this type of research, the data quality may not be entirely guaranteed due to the web-based format. PD patients may not be fully engaged in a long survey due to poor physical and mental health, which could affect reliability of our findings. Last, considering we have collaborated with patient association to collect data, clinical information, such as comorbidities, were not collected based on their medical records. This may affect the validity of our findings. Overall, the 3L, 5L, and SF-6Dv2 instruments demonstrate satisfactory psychometric properties in Chinese patients with PD. The 5L showed better convergent and discriminant validity than the other instruments, while the 3L demonstrated better test–retest reliability than the 5L and SF-6Dv2. In addition, the 5L may generate a larger utility gain compared to the other two instruments when conducting cost-effectiveness analysis for interventions related to PD. Decision-makers should select an instrument based on the specific purpose of their research or practice.",N/A,12 3 2024
Effectiveness of Respiratory Muscle Training in Pompe Disease: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis,"<bold>Background</bold>: Pompe disease is a rare metabolic myopathy caused by the lack or deficiency of the lysosomal acid alpha-glucosidase, resulting in skeletal muscle weakness and cardiomyopathy. The disease varies by onset age and genetic mutations and is categorized into infantile-onset and late-onset Pompe disease. Respiratory muscle weakness may persist regardless enzyme replacement therapy. This systemic review and meta-analysis aim to assess the effect of respiratory muscle training (RMT) on respiratory muscle strength, functional endurance, and pulmonary function in patient with Pompe disease. <bold>Methods</bold>: PubMed, EMBASE, and Cochrane databases were searched up until Aug 2024. Studies examining the therapeutic effects of RMT in patients with Pompe disease were included. Outcome measures included the change in maximal inspiratory pressure (MIP), maximal expiratory pressure (MEP), six-minute walking test (6MWT), pulmonary function before after RMT, quality of life and adverse events. <bold>Results</bold>: The meta-analysis consisted of 5 single-arm studies, including 31 patients in total. Regarding inspiratory muscle strength, RMT has significantly improving MIP (8.71 cmH<sub>2</sub>O; 95% CI, 6.23–11.19, <italic toggle=""yes"">p</italic> < 0.001) and MEP (12.15 cmH<sub>2</sub>O; 95% CI, 10.55–13.74, <italic toggle=""yes"">p</italic> < 0.001) in both types of Pompe disease. However, no significant change regarding 6MWT. No serious adverse events were reported. <bold>Conclusions</bold>: Our meta-analysis revealed that RMT may increase inspiratory muscle and expiratory muscle strength, but may not have an effect on 6MWT in patients with Pompe disease. RMT has potential to be integrated into the cardioplulmonary rehabilitation for patients with Pompe disease. Further large randomized controlled trials are needed to verify the efficacy and safety of RMT in patients with Pompe disease.","Pompe disease, known as glycogen storage disorder type II or acid maltase deficiency, is a rare metabolic muscle disorder that passed down through autosomal recessive inheritance. A deficiency or lack in the lysosomal enzyme acid alpha-glucosidase (GAA) results in the buildup of glycogen in the smooth, cardiac, and skeletal myocytes, which causes weakness of the affected muscles, often resulting in premature death [<xref rid=""B1-children-11-01209"" ref-type=""bibr"">1</xref>]. The incidence of Pompe disease differs across ethnicities and regions, and it affects approximately 1 in 40,000 to 1 in 200,000 individuals globally [<xref rid=""B2-children-11-01209"" ref-type=""bibr"">2</xref>,<xref rid=""B3-children-11-01209"" ref-type=""bibr"">3</xref>,<xref rid=""B4-children-11-01209"" ref-type=""bibr"">4</xref>]. The clinical manifestation of Pompe disease varies based on factors such as the age of onset, specific genetic mutations involved, and rate of disease progression [<xref rid=""B5-children-11-01209"" ref-type=""bibr"">5</xref>]. Pompe disease is classified into two forms according to the residual GAA activity: late-onset Pompe disease (LOPD) and infantile-onset Pompe disease (IOPD) [<xref rid=""B6-children-11-01209"" ref-type=""bibr"">6</xref>]. IOPD arises from a complete or near-total absence of GAA activity. Symptoms of IOPD typically manifest within the first few days to weeks after birth and include respiratory insufficiency, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, reduced muscle tone and severe muscle weakness [<xref rid=""B7-children-11-01209"" ref-type=""bibr"">7</xref>]. Without adequate treatment, fatal cardiorespiratory failure can occur by the age of 24 months [<xref rid=""B8-children-11-01209"" ref-type=""bibr"">8</xref>]. Treatment options for respiratory muscle weakness caused by Pompe disease are limited. Since its introduction in 2006, the enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) with alglucosidase alfa (Myozyme™) has significantly enhanced both overall and ventilator-free survival in children with IOPD [<xref rid=""B9-children-11-01209"" ref-type=""bibr"">9</xref>,<xref rid=""B10-children-11-01209"" ref-type=""bibr"">10</xref>,<xref rid=""B11-children-11-01209"" ref-type=""bibr"">11</xref>]. However, in few children with IOPD, respiratory muscle weakness can persist despite ERT. This weakness can lead to hypoventilation, diminished cough effectiveness, and a reduced capacity for physical activity [<xref rid=""B12-children-11-01209"" ref-type=""bibr"">12</xref>,<xref rid=""B13-children-11-01209"" ref-type=""bibr"">13</xref>,<xref rid=""B14-children-11-01209"" ref-type=""bibr"">14</xref>]. The first RMT study on IOPD patients by Jones et al. demonstrated the effectiveness and safety of respiratory muscle training (RMT) for improving the maximal expiratory pressure (MEP) and maximal inspiratory pressure (MIP) in IOPD patients [<xref rid=""B14-children-11-01209"" ref-type=""bibr"">14</xref>]. Moreover, the findings were supported by the replicated study, and proved that these effects are maintained after detraining [<xref rid=""B15-children-11-01209"" ref-type=""bibr"">15</xref>]. Patients with LOPD typically have a more insidious course and experience proximal muscle weakness that becomes evident around the age of 30 years [<xref rid=""B16-children-11-01209"" ref-type=""bibr"">16</xref>]. Respiratory muscle weakness is frequently noticed while diagnosis, in which the inspiratory muscles are primarily affected [<xref rid=""B17-children-11-01209"" ref-type=""bibr"">17</xref>], and respiratory-muscle weakness leads to reduced airway clearance, impaired cough [<xref rid=""B18-children-11-01209"" ref-type=""bibr"">18</xref>,<xref rid=""B19-children-11-01209"" ref-type=""bibr"">19</xref>], sleep-disordered breathing [<xref rid=""B20-children-11-01209"" ref-type=""bibr"">20</xref>,<xref rid=""B21-children-11-01209"" ref-type=""bibr"">21</xref>], progressive respiratory insufficiency [<xref rid=""B22-children-11-01209"" ref-type=""bibr"">22</xref>], and acute or chronic respiratory failure [<xref rid=""B23-children-11-01209"" ref-type=""bibr"">23</xref>]. Notably, respiratory functional outcomes of ERT are inconsistent in patients with LOPD. Few studies have reported a notable deceleration in LOPD progression with stabilization of pulmonary function [<xref rid=""B24-children-11-01209"" ref-type=""bibr"">24</xref>,<xref rid=""B25-children-11-01209"" ref-type=""bibr"">25</xref>,<xref rid=""B26-children-11-01209"" ref-type=""bibr"">26</xref>]. However, a prospective study that recruited 177 patients did not demonstrate a similar effect on respiratory support [<xref rid=""B27-children-11-01209"" ref-type=""bibr"">27</xref>,<xref rid=""B28-children-11-01209"" ref-type=""bibr"">28</xref>]. Moreover, extended observational studies have revealed that approximately one-third of the patients exhibit an inadequate response to treatment and experience a decline in pulmonary function, eventually requiring ventilator support [<xref rid=""B29-children-11-01209"" ref-type=""bibr"">29</xref>,<xref rid=""B30-children-11-01209"" ref-type=""bibr"">30</xref>]. Therefore, additional interventions, such as RMT, are important to enhance the cardiopulmonary capacity in individuals with Pompe disease [<xref rid=""B31-children-11-01209"" ref-type=""bibr"">31</xref>,<xref rid=""B32-children-11-01209"" ref-type=""bibr"">32</xref>,<xref rid=""B33-children-11-01209"" ref-type=""bibr"">33</xref>,<xref rid=""B34-children-11-01209"" ref-type=""bibr"">34</xref>]. Martin et al. reported that inspiratory muscle training (IMT) improved lung function, muscular strength, and endurance in a patient with LOPD [<xref rid=""B35-children-11-01209"" ref-type=""bibr"">35</xref>]. Furthermore, three trials assessing the effects of IMT in LOPD patients reported a significant improvement in respiratory muscle strength, but not in pulmonary function, after IMT [<xref rid=""B34-children-11-01209"" ref-type=""bibr"">34</xref>,<xref rid=""B36-children-11-01209"" ref-type=""bibr"">36</xref>,<xref rid=""B37-children-11-01209"" ref-type=""bibr"">37</xref>]. Recently, Bordoli et al. published the first systematic review on the efficacy of physical training in glycogen storage disorders [<xref rid=""B38-children-11-01209"" ref-type=""bibr"">38</xref>]. They included studies on patients with McArdles and Pompe diseases, and seven studies focused on Pompe disease. Improvements in respiratory muscle strength and additional benefits, such as improvements in the aerobic fitness, functional endurance, and general health, were observed. While ERT remains a cornerstone treatment, its impact on respiratory dysfunction is inconsistent. Additional RMT is considered important for patients with Pompe disease, by enhancing pulmonary outcomes and improving functional capacity and quality of life for patients. No previous meta-analysis has systematically explored the effects of RMT on respiratory muscle strength, pulmonary function, and functional endurance in this population. Therefore, our systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to assess these effects and provide potential clinical hint in improving comprehensiveness of Pompe disease care.    The findings of this study indicate that RMT significantly improves both inspiratory and expiratory muscle strength, particularly in patients with LOPD. Nevertheless, no significant improvement was seen regarding 6MWT after RMT. The effects on functional endurance, lung function, and QoL in patients with Pompe disease remain unclear. RMT could be considered for cardiac and pulmonary rehabilitation in Pompe disease patients. However, the efficacy and optimal protocol of RMT in patients with Pompe disease needs to be verified in large randomized controlled trials.",N/A,30 9 2024
Living with Pompe disease: results from a qualitative interview study with children and adolescents and their caregivers,,"Pompe disease (PD; OMIM♯232300; Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man, OMIM<sup>®</sup>), also known as glycogen storage disease type II and acid maltase deficiency, is a very rare, progressive, and often debilitating metabolic myopathy. Inheritance is autosomal recessive: pathogenic variants in the <italic toggle=""yes"">GAA</italic> gene cause deficient activity of the enzyme acid alpha-glucosidase, which breaks down lysosomal glycogen. The age of onset is variable, and phenotypic variance is large, ranging from the classic and rapidly progressive infantile-onset type (IOPD) to the attenuated late-onset type (LOPD) [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR1"">1</xref>]. Both types are characterized by progressive muscle weakness, which often leads to limitations in motor and respiratory functions. IOPD patients usually have very severe muscular hypotonia and the heart is also affected in terms of a cardiomyopathy. Untreated, IOPD usually leads to cardiorespiratory failure within the first years of life [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR2"">2</xref>, <xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR3"">3</xref>]. Enzyme replacement therapy (ERT), approved in 2006, reduces mortality effectively in IOPD [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR4"">4</xref>] and improves physical and respiratory function in LOPD [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR5"">5</xref>]. However, ERT is time-consuming, costly and does alleviate but not cure the disease. Patients continue to suffer progression of symptoms [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR6"">6</xref>, <xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR7"">7</xref>]. Under ERT, a new IOPD phenotype has emerged, including long-term survivors who may achieve developmental milestones like walking independently and/or sitting unassisted [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR4"">4</xref>, <xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR8"">8</xref>]. Still, most IOPD patients experience secondary decline during childhood and the loss of achieved milestones. Also, severe breathing difficulties requiring invasive ventilation, swallowing difficulties and need for nasogastric tube or gastrostomy, as well as hearing difficulties are common in IOPD [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR6"">6</xref>, <xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR9"">9</xref>]. Children and adolescents with LOPD are comparatively less affected in terms of both motor and respiratory function. However, the phenotypic spectrum is wide, ranging from asymptomatic at time of diagnosis to patients needing walking aids and/or ventilation at some point even with treatment [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR5"">5</xref>, <xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR10"">10</xref>]. Both types may experience other symptoms including pain, fatigue, speech difficulties, and gastrointestinal complaints [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR4"">4</xref>, <xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR11"">11</xref>]. Given the chronic nature of PD and the lifelong need for medical care, it is important to understand how best to support patients and families. Insight into subjective outcomes such as health-related quality of life (HRQoL) are crucial for this purpose [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR12"">12</xref>]. Many definitions of HRQoL emphasize that it is a subjective and multidimensional construct about the biopsychosocial impact of disease and treatment [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR13"">13</xref>, <xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR14"">14</xref>]. However, HRQoL is often not clearly distinguished from related concepts, in particular, from functioning, disability, and health (FDH), also termed health or functioning status [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR15"">15</xref>, <xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR16"">16</xref>]. Cieza and colleagues [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR15"">15</xref>, <xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR17"">17</xref>, <xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR18"">18</xref>] have provided helpful clarification by defining HRQoL as subjective feelings, emotions, and appraisals about health-related domains (e.g., satisfaction with physical abilities), whereas FDH includes subjective self-reports on objective health-related facts (e.g., statements about the ability to walk for a long time). In this paper, we adopt this distinction and refer to FDH-related aspects as “perception” and HRQoL-related aspects as “experience.” Efforts have been made to examine disease-specific FDH and HRQoL through qualitative studies with adult PD patients and experts and the development of self-report questionnaires [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR19"">19</xref>–<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR22"">22</xref>]. However, very little is known about the health perceptions and appraisals of children and adolescents with PD. Today, only one disease-specific proxy report is available for this age group, and it focuses solely on mobility and self-care from an FDH perspective (Pompe-PEDI; [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR23"">23</xref>]). Our research group is currently developing the first disease-specific questionnaire for pediatric patients with PD that covers FDH and HRQoL through self- and proxy-report (manuscript submitted for publication by our research group). Creating items with high content validity requires concept elicitation interviews with patients to identify meaningful topics [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR24"">24</xref>, <xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR25"">25</xref>]. Such qualitative approaches can facilitate a better understanding of the burdens and needs of the patient population and provide a starting point for improving patient support, clinical care, and ultimately their HRQoL. This paper presents a qualitative content analysis of interviews with children and adolescents with PD and their caregivers. The study identifies key topics of PD-specific FDH and HRQoL and thus provides insights into their lives. We explore four major thematic areas: (1) perceptions of symptoms and related limitations, (2) experiences to do with the biopsychosocial impact of PD on their lives, (3) experiences to do with treatment, and (4) general emotional well-being/burden.   This study offers a broad picture of topics reported by children and adolescents with PD and their parents about how they perceive symptoms and related limitations (FDH-related aspects), how they experience the biopsychosocial impact of PD and its treatment on their lives (HRQoL-related aspects), and their general emotional well-being/burden. Through thematic content analysis of qualitative interviews with patients and caregivers, we identified 16 main categories, many with subcategories, relevant to PD-specific FDH or HRQoL. Our results advance the understanding of the burdens and needs of children and adolescents with PD and provide a basis for improving patient support, clinical care, and patients’ HRQoL. In addition, they are critical for ensuring the content validity of the first disease-specific questionnaire for pediatric patients with PD assessing both FDH and HRQoL. In Area I, disease-specific FDH, broad heterogeneity was observed in perceived symptoms, their severity, and associated limitations among children and adolescents with PD, corresponding with the well-documented PD phenotypic variance [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR10"">10</xref>]. Our sample depicted this variance, ranging from a female adolescent unable to move at all and dependent on constant ventilatory support to a male adolescent who considered himself physically fitter than most of his healthy peers. Muscle weakness in legs, arms, and core was the most prevalent symptom, leading to walking difficulties in almost all cases. Breathing difficulties, musculoskeletal issues, and fatigue were each problematic for about one third of participants, with other symptoms such as swallowing difficulties commonly reported. The issues mentioned and their heterogeneity align with qualitative studies investigating adults with LOPD [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR31"">31</xref>] and are essential to developing and phrasing appropriate FDH-related items for our questionnaire. Participants reported continuous or sudden improvements after starting ERT or adjusting dosages. In line with previous research [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR41"">41</xref>, <xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR42"">42</xref>], accounts of symptom deterioration after several years of treatment were also identified. These findings emphasize the need of regular monitoring and the importance of the ongoing developments of new treatment options [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR43"">43</xref>, <xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR44"">44</xref>]. In Area II, belonging to HRQoL, specific physical aspects were often a major burden for the subgroups of patients impacted by them. Intense pain in particular caused severe suffering. This is in line with a systematic review of 48 qualitative studies on children and adolescents with neurological or musculoskeletal disorders which indicated that pain is a main cause of reduced quality of life [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR45"">45</xref>]. Regular assessment and adequate treatment of pain is therefore important in PD patients. Given the interplay of biological, psychological, and social factors contributing to chronic pain, multidisciplinary treatment such as a combination of psychological, physical, and medical interventions is recommended for pediatric pain management [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR46"">46</xref>]. Physical limitations emerged as a key impact, leading to negative emotions such as frustration in almost all patients, even those with comparatively mild restrictions. This was probably because not only the restrictions themselves but also their social consequences were bothersome. This aligns with reports from ambulatory boys with Duchenne muscular dystrophy that the inability to keep up with peers is especially relevant to them [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR47"">47</xref>]. Although physical limitations cannot be directly changed, the social exclusion associated with them could be addressed, for example by school-based interventions. Studies focusing on awareness enhancement have shown promising results in improved attitudes and acceptance of peers with disabilities [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR48"">48</xref>, <xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR49"">49</xref>]. The appraisal of having <italic toggle=""yes"">a disease</italic> as either “okay” or “quite burdensome” was also important. Cognitive and emotional perceptions and appraisals of illness have long been discussed as central factors influencing coping and psychological adjustment to chronic disease in patients of all ages [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR50"">50</xref>–<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR52"">52</xref>]. In our sample, “having PD” was viewed exclusively negatively by the two patients who were emotionally very burdened. Furthermore, an overall negative view of PD overlapped with other negative experiences related to being confronted with the disease: disability-related shame, annoyance at being asked about PD, and all treatment-related appointments. To challenge dysfunctional illness-related cognitions and coping strategies and improve psychological well-being, cognitive behavioral therapy has been proposed for pediatric patients with physical diseases [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR53"">53</xref>]. In Area III, also HRQoL, patients acknowledged the necessity of treatment, although some found it very burdensome, as with other chronic conditions [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR45"">45</xref>]. Consistent with a previous qualitative study investigating hospital-based ERT in which some participants expressed strong wishes for home-based infusion [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR32"">32</xref>], the transition to home infusion generally increased treatment satisfaction by reducing both infusion-related burden and disruptions to daily life. Given the huge relief it brings and its safety [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR54"">54</xref>, <xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR55"">55</xref>], ERT should be available at home for all patients. Medical check-ups were experienced as scary, annoying, or even unnecessary by some of the patients. Thus, and in line with general recommendations for pediatric patients with chronic conditions, medical teams should carefully consider the necessity and frequency of follow-ups [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR12"">12</xref>]. Furthermore, our findings suggest that open communication about the aims of examinations and patient involvement in organizing check-ups, for instance deciding between outpatient or inpatient between visits, could reduce burden. To reduce injection-related burden from both ERT and check-ups, a combination of topical anesthetics, age-appropriated distraction, and positioning for comfort is recommended for pediatric patients [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR56"">56</xref>]. In Area IV, the main finding was that most patients in our sample, including the most severely affected, were not generally emotionally burdened (Area IV). This suggests that, overall, most pediatric patients adapt well to their condition, and that severe limitations do not necessarily lead to lower emotional well-being. Similar phenomena, known as the “disability paradox,” have been described in other chronic diseases [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR57"">57</xref>]. A study on adults with PD also found no significant correlation between functional disability and mental health [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR58"">58</xref>]. Thus, the emotional well-being of pediatric patients should be assessed independently of objective disease severity to identify those who may benefit from psychological support. Overall, our results highlight that not only physical but also various psychosocial factors impact children and adolescents with PD. However, current recommendations on the clinical management of pediatric patients with PD do not yet incorporate such aspects [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR59"">59</xref>, <xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR60"">60</xref>]. Therefore, it is important that forthcoming recommendations take this into account by mirroring approaches undertaken for children with similar diseases such as spinal muscular atrophy [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR61"">61</xref>]. The main limitation of our study is the use of a convenience sample, which may introduce selection bias and thus limit the generalizability of the results. In this respect, it should be noted that children and adolescents with severe health issues who could not follow the study procedures had to be excluded, resulting in less self-reported interview data from more affected patients. To address this, we included parents regardless of their child’s health status. Additionally, the cross-cultural generalizability of our findings may be limited because we only included participants with sufficient German knowledge from three German-speaking countries. Furthermore, although the clear separation of FDH from HRQoL was a strength, this dual focus resulted in a lengthy interview manual with many questions. Thus, some restrictions on follow-up questions were necessary to manage acceptable interview duration, which in turn potentially limited the depth of exploration of some topics. Future qualitative studies focusing on narrower constructs with more representative samples would enhance understanding of the unique challenges faced by children and adolescents with PD. In addition, while comparable with other qualitative studies devised for questionnaire development [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR27"">27</xref>, <xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR31"">31</xref>, <xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR62"">62</xref>], our sample size is relatively small for quantitative estimations. Therefore, caution is advised when interpreting frequency data. Also, the qualitative design and sample size precluded rigorous identification of potential risk and protection factors. Although the present results suggest that objective disease characteristics are poor indicators of HRQoL in pediatric patients in PD, future quantitative studies with larger samples are needed to test the impact of medical variables on HRQoL and to assess potentially influential sociodemographic factors such as age and gender. An important strength of this study is the clear distinction between FDH and HRQoL, which addressed past and ongoing inconsistencies in the literature [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR15"">15</xref>, <xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR16"">16</xref>, <xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR38"">38</xref>]. In addition, the international patient recruitment resulted in a diverse sample and reduced center-related bias. The use of a structured interview manual based on previous experience [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR26"">26</xref>, <xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR27"">27</xref>] and expert input ensured consistency in data collection, and the content analysis was performed using established procedures and software. Finally, a qualitative approach such as ours enhances content validity when developing a questionnaire [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR24"">24</xref>, <xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR25"">25</xref>] and provides broad in-depth insights into the disease-specific health perceptions and experiences of children and adolescents with PD. Our qualitative interview study identified key physical and psychosocial challenges faced by children and adolescents with PD. Interestingly, many young patients adapted well to their condition in their overall emotional well-being. However, the various impacts of the disease and its treatment were also linked to substantial burdens that were not proportional to objective disease severity. Some of these can probably be alleviated, for example through tailored psychosocial support. Therefore, it is crucial to identify patients at risk for impaired HRQoL. Our newly developed questionnaire, informed by the present results, should be tested as a screening tool for this purpose. Additionally, our results underscore the importance to patients of administering ERT at home.",N/A,28 9 2024
Optimizing clinical outcomes: The journey of twins with CRIM-negative infantile-onset Pompe disease on high-dose enzyme replacement therapy and immunomodulation,"Infantile-onset Pompe disease (IOPD) is caused by a deficiency in the enzyme acid alpha-glucosidase (GAA). It is characterized by severe and progressive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and muscle weakness with death in the first 2 years of life if left untreated. Enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) with alglucosidase-alfa is lifesaving, but its effectiveness is influenced by the patient's cross-reactive immunologic material (CRIM) status, dose of ERT, and the development of high antibody titers, which can reduce the therapy's efficacy. The inability of CRIM-negative IOPD patients to produce native GAA exposes them to a high risk of development of anti-rhGAA IgG antibody titers, leading to treatment failure. We present the case of CRIM-negative dizygotic twins treated with high-dose alglucosidase-alfa (40 mg/kg/week), initiated at 28 days (Twin A) and 44 days (Twin B). Both twins received immune tolerance induction (ITI) with rituximab, methotrexate, and IVIG to mitigate antibody response. Initial evaluations revealed elevated left ventricular mass index (LVMI) and elevated biomarkers (urine glucose tetrasaccharide (Glc<sub>4</sub>), creatine kinase (CK), and aspartate aminotransferase (AST)) in both twins. Following treatment, cardiac function and biomarkers normalized within several months, with a slight delay in Twin B compared to Twin A, likely attributed to the later initiation of ERT. Both twins safely tolerated ITI, achieving immune tolerance with low antibody titers. At 28 months, the twins transitioned to avalglucosidase-alfa (40 mg/kg every other week (EOW)), which was well tolerated without an increase in antibody titers. At 39 months, both twins exhibited normal cardiac function, LVMI, and biomarkers. Motor skills continued to improve, though some kinematic concerns persisted. These cases underscore the importance of early, high-dose ERT combined with ITI in managing CRIM-negative IOPD. While transitioning to avalglucosidase-alfa at 40 mg/kg/EOW was beneficial and well-tolerated in our patients, further studies are needed to confirm its long-term efficacy compared to the high-dose weekly 40 mg/kg alglucosidase-alfa. <list list-type=""simple"" id=""l0005""><list-item id=""li0005""><label>•</label><p id=""p0005"">Early high-dose ERT and ITI showed positive outcomes in CRIM-negative IOPD twins.</p></list-item><list-item id=""li0010""><label>•</label><p id=""p0010"">A few days delay in treatment initiation can delay LVMI and biomarker normalization.</p></list-item><list-item id=""li0015""><label>•</label><p id=""p0015"">Findings suggest that 40 mg/kg/EOW avalglucosidase-alfa ensures sustained benefits.</p></list-item></list>","Pompe disease, also known as glycogen storage disease type II (OMIM #<ext-link ext-link-type=""omim"" http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink href=""232300"" id=""ir0005"">232300</ext-link>) [<xref rid=""bb0005"" ref-type=""bibr"">1</xref>], is an autosomal recessive disorder resulting from a deficiency in the lysosomal enzyme acid alpha-glucosidase (GAA) [<xref rid=""bb0005"" ref-type=""bibr"">1</xref>,<xref rid=""bb0010"" ref-type=""bibr"">2</xref>], leading to the accumulation of glycogen in skeletal, cardiac, and smooth muscles [<xref rid=""bb0010"" ref-type=""bibr"">2</xref>]. Infantile-onset Pompe disease (IOPD) is at the most severe end of the disease spectrum, characterized by cardiomyopathy, failure to thrive, hypotonia, and respiratory insufficiency. Without treatment, most infants do not survive beyond the first one to two years of life due to cardiorespiratory failure [<xref rid=""bb0005"" ref-type=""bibr"">1</xref>]. In 2006, enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) with recombinant human acid α-glucosidase (rhGAA; alglucosidase alfa) was approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), improving survival, cardiac and motor outcomes [<xref rid=""bb0015"" ref-type=""bibr"">3</xref>]. However, patient outcomes on ERT remained variable due to factors including cross-reactive immunologic material (CRIM) status, anti-rhGAA immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibody titers, age of ERT initiation, ERT dose, and extent of disease progression at diagnosis [<xref rid=""bb0020"" ref-type=""bibr"">[4]</xref>, <xref rid=""bb0025"" ref-type=""bibr"">[5]</xref>, <xref rid=""bb0030"" ref-type=""bibr"">[6]</xref>, <xref rid=""bb0035"" ref-type=""bibr"">[7]</xref>, <xref rid=""bb0040"" ref-type=""bibr"">[8]</xref>]. The inability of CRIM-negative IOPD patients to produce native GAA exposes them to a high risk of immunological challenges, including the development of high and sustained anti-rhGAA IgG antibody titers (HSAT; antibody titers ≥12,800) [<xref rid=""bb0025"" ref-type=""bibr"">5</xref>,<xref rid=""bb0045"" ref-type=""bibr"">9</xref>]. The development of HSAT significantly impairs the efficacy of ERT due to the neutralizing response of the antibodies on either enzyme uptake into cells or the catalytic activity of the enzyme, translating into treatment failure [<xref rid=""bb0030"" ref-type=""bibr"">6</xref>,<xref rid=""bb0050"" ref-type=""bibr"">10</xref>]. Immune tolerance induction (ITI) to prevent and mitigate an immune response is now a standard of care, especially in CRIM-negative IOPD [<xref rid=""bb0055"" ref-type=""bibr"">11</xref>]. A short course of rituximab, methotrexate, and intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) for ERT-naïve patients has successfully induced immune tolerance with significant improvement in survival and clinical outcomes [<xref rid=""bb0060"" ref-type=""bibr"">12</xref>,<xref rid=""bb0065"" ref-type=""bibr"">13</xref>]. Age and stage of the disease at treatment initiation also significantly impact treatment outcomes [<xref rid=""bb0070"" ref-type=""bibr"">14</xref>]. Patients with pronounced cardiomyopathy, significant motor delay, and requiring ventilatory support at baseline tend to have a suboptimal response to ERT compared to patients diagnosed and treated in the earlier stage of the disease [<xref rid=""bb0015"" ref-type=""bibr"">3</xref>]. Among a Taiwanese cohort of CRIM-positive IOPD patients diagnosed by newborn screening (NBS), ERT initiation within the first month of life led to improved long-term outcomes including independent walking and ventilator-free survival [<xref rid=""bb0075"" ref-type=""bibr"">15</xref>]. Although the data demonstrated significant benefits of early treatment, the study did not include the most severe phenotype, CRIM-negative IOPD. Li et al. investigated the benefits of early ERT concomitant with ITI (rituximab, methotrexate, and IVIG) in CRIM-negative IOPD patients and compared the outcomes with CRIM-negative patients treated beyond 4 weeks of age [<xref rid=""bb0070"" ref-type=""bibr"">14</xref>]. Twenty CRIM-negative IOPD patients were grouped based on age at ERT initiation: early (ETG, before 4 weeks of age), intermediate (ITG), and late treatment groups (LTG) [<xref rid=""bb0070"" ref-type=""bibr"">14</xref>]. Median ages were 2.1 weeks for ETG, 7.6 weeks for ITG, and 17.9 weeks for LTG [<xref rid=""bb0070"" ref-type=""bibr"">14</xref>]. Early treated patients showed improved clinical outcomes, biomarkers and survival without respiratory or feeding assistance compared to patients treated at greater than 4 weeks of age [<xref rid=""bb0070"" ref-type=""bibr"">14</xref>]. Alglucosidase-alfa at doses of 40 mg/kg/week have been shown to further improve clinical outcomes and biomarkers such as aspartate aminotransferase (AST), creatine kinase (CK), and urine glucose tetrasaccharide (Glc<sub>4</sub>) [<xref rid=""bb0075"" ref-type=""bibr"">[15]</xref>, <xref rid=""bb0080"" ref-type=""bibr"">[16]</xref>, <xref rid=""bb0085"" ref-type=""bibr"">[17]</xref>, <xref rid=""bb0090"" ref-type=""bibr"">[18]</xref>]. The twins described in this study were started on this ERT dose based on these findings. Next-generation therapies with improved targeting of skeletal muscles have been another advancement in the field [<xref rid=""bb0095"" ref-type=""bibr"">19</xref>,<xref rid=""bb0100"" ref-type=""bibr"">20</xref>]. Avalglucosidase-alfa and Cipaglucosidase-alfa are next-generation recombinant human GAA (rhGAA) ERT designed for enhanced targeting of mannose-6-phosphate (M6P) receptor-mediated uptake [<xref rid=""bb0105"" ref-type=""bibr"">21</xref>,<xref rid=""bb0110"" ref-type=""bibr"">22</xref>]. Avalglucosidase-alfa given at 20 mg/kg EOW and 40 mg/kg/EOW has demonstrated a positive impact on motor and cardiac function in 22 patients with IOPD with a suboptimal response or plateau on alglucosidase-alfa. One of them switched from a dose of 40 mg/kg/week of alglucosidase-alfa to 40 mg/kg/EOW of avalglucosidase-alfa demonstrating further improvement in clinical outcomes [<xref rid=""bb0115"" ref-type=""bibr"">23</xref>]. The study details the clinical journey and outcomes of dizygotic twins with CRIM-negative IOPD, who were initiated on high-dose alglucosidase-alfa at 40 mg/kg/week along with ITI at 28 and 44 days of age, respectively. As twins with the same pathogenic variants diagnosed and treated early, their case uniquely highlights the impact of early treatment on the most severe Pompe disease phenotype, emphasizing the importance of NBS. It also allows assessment of how even a few days delay in treatment can affect disease progression and ERT response. Earlier treatment initiation manifested in earlier normalization of cardiomyopathy and biomarkers in Twin A compared to Twin B. Both twins transitioned to avalglucosidase-alfa at 28 months and currently demonstrate normal cardiac function, stable biomarker levels, and steadily improving motor function, walking and running at 3 years old. A retrospective chart review of a set of dizygotic twins born to non-consanguineous parents of African-Jamaican descent at 38 weeks and 3/7 days of gestation was conducted. Clinical data including <italic toggle=""yes"">GAA</italic> pathogenic variants, age, and doses of ERT + ITI treatment, overall and invasive ventilator–free survival, left ventricular mass index (LVMI), feeding status, motor status, CK, urine Glc<sub>4</sub>, and anti-rhGAA IgG antibodies were extracted from medical records. The upper limit of normal (ULN) urine Glc<sub>4</sub> were determined according to age, as previously published [<xref rid=""bb0120"" ref-type=""bibr"">24</xref>]. Motor status was described based on chart review and physical therapy assessments done at Duke University Medical Center which included Gross Motor Function Measure-88 (GMFM-88) [<xref rid=""bb0125"" ref-type=""bibr"">25</xref>], Peabody Developmental Motor Scales – 2nd Edition (PDMS-2) [<xref rid=""bb0130"" ref-type=""bibr"">26</xref>], and kinematic and postural assessment performed at 23, 32 and 41 months of age. Anti-rhGAA IgG antibody titers were determined by LabCorp as previously described [<xref rid=""bb0135"" ref-type=""bibr"">27</xref>]. LVMI was manually calculated based on Doppler echocardiography reports. Clinical outcomes were compared to CRIM-negative IOPD patients treated before or at age 1 month with ERT initiated at less than 40 mg/kg/week and ITI [<xref rid=""bb0070"" ref-type=""bibr"">14</xref>]. We discuss the case of a set of male (Twin A) and female (Twin B) 3-year-old CRIM-negative IOPD twins, homozygous for a nonsense mutation (c.2560C > T; p.Arg854*) in exon 18 of <italic toggle=""yes"">GAA</italic> [<xref rid=""bb0140"" ref-type=""bibr"">28</xref>]. CRIM-negative status was predicted based on the variants detected [<xref rid=""bb0140"" ref-type=""bibr"">28</xref>]. This report highlights a positive outcome in a set of dizygotic twins with CRIM-negative IOPD initiated early on high-dose alglucosidase-alfa (40 mg/kg/week) with concomitant ITI, transitioning to avalglucosidase-alfa (40 mg/kg/EOW). By 32 months, the twins demonstrated normal LVMI, cardiac function, and stable biomarkers, along with steadily improving motor skills in GMFM Dimensions D (Standing) and E (Walking, Running, and Jumping) percents and PDMS-2 percentile scores on Stationary and Locomotion Subscales indicated gross motor skills within the average range for age. However, more recent assessment at 41 months revealed decreased percentile scores on PDMS-2 relative to age-level peers, despite gained skills because they were not gaining skills as quickly as age level peers in more challenging tasks such as unilateral standing, hopping, and jumping, primarily due to residual kinematic challenges such as anterior pelvic tilt and subtalar pronation. To enhance alignment and stability, inframalleolar orthoses were recommended. On the GMFM, which assesses actual improvement not compared to age level peers, Twin A outperformed Twin B at the most recent assessment at 41 months with a 7.43 % higher GMFM D&E total score, 5.13 % higher Dimension D, and 9.72 % higher Dimension E scores, surpassing the minimal clinically important difference (MCID) of large effect size [<xref rid=""bb0145"" ref-type=""bibr"">29</xref>]. Delays in motor milestones and time to normalization of biomarkers were observed in Twin B, likely due to a 16-day delay in treatment initiation [<xref rid=""bb0075"" ref-type=""bibr"">15</xref>]. For instance, Twin A took his first steps at 9 months and Twin B at 13 months. Twin A could descend stairs without using a railing at 32 months and Twin B still needed to use a railing at 41 months. Tasks requiring attention and following directions, such as walking between lines or maintaining hands on hips during balance tasks, were sometimes more challenging for Twin A, resulting in lower gains in specific scores requiring attention and following directions though steady motor progress occurred in both twins. Despite their progress, the twins continue to display postural and kinematic deviations, indicating decreased core and proximal strength. These cases underscore the importance of pediatric physical therapists experienced in neuromuscular disorders for managing IOPD. To the best of our knowledge, none of the reported cases of CRIM-negative IOPD were started early on high-dose ERT of 40 mg/kg/week [<xref rid=""bb0020"" ref-type=""bibr"">4</xref>,<xref rid=""bb0060"" ref-type=""bibr"">12</xref>,<xref rid=""bb0070"" ref-type=""bibr"">14</xref>,<xref rid=""bb0145"" ref-type=""bibr"">[29]</xref>, <xref rid=""bb0150"" ref-type=""bibr"">[30]</xref>, <xref rid=""bb0155"" ref-type=""bibr"">[31]</xref>, <xref rid=""bb0160"" ref-type=""bibr"">[32]</xref>]. A study on 5 CRIM-negative IOPD patients treated early (median age 2.1 weeks) with a lifelong average dose of ERT of 1.57 (1.04–2.01) x standard dose showed stable biomarker trends and improved survival without needing respiratory or feeding support [<xref rid=""bb0070"" ref-type=""bibr"">14</xref>]. However, these patients had delayed normalization of biomarkers compared to the twins treated with 40 mg/kg/week [<xref rid=""bb0165"" ref-type=""bibr"">33</xref>,<xref rid=""bb0170"" ref-type=""bibr"">34</xref>]. This confirms what was previously demonstrated that a delay by even a few days in ERT initiation can significantly impact long-term IOPD outcomes. Recently, in-utero ERT has resulted in promising outcomes in a fetus with CRIM-negative IOPD, with the patient having normal cardiac parameters, age-appropriate motor function, and developmental milestones postnatally [<xref rid=""bb0180"" ref-type=""bibr"">35</xref>]. Avalglucosidase alfa and cipaglucosidase-alfa are a next-generation recombinant human GAA (rhGAA) ERT designed for enhanced targeting of mannose-6-phosphate (M6P) receptor-mediated uptake [<xref rid=""bb0105"" ref-type=""bibr"">21</xref>,<xref rid=""bb0110"" ref-type=""bibr"">22</xref>]. The mini-COMET trial supports the positive clinical impact on motor and cardiac function with the use of avalglucosidase-alfa in patients with IOPD who had a suboptimal response or plateau on alglucosidase-alfa. Benefits were even noted in patients who switched from alglucosidase-alfa doses of 40 mg/kg/week to avalglucosidase-alfa administered at a dose of 40 mg/kg EOW in an outpatient setting, with no increased safety risk seen [<xref rid=""bb0115"" ref-type=""bibr"">23</xref>]. In the case of our patients, this transition resulted in continued benefits. The data presented herein further validates the value of early diagnosis and early treatment in improving the clinical outcomes of patients with IOPD. Furthermore, these cases demonstrate that the outcomes in early treated patients can be further enhanced by implementing a higher dose of ERT from the outset. It is yet to be seen if the approach of early treatment combined with higher dose of therapeutic protein can resolve the residual impairments that are seen in long-term survivors of IOPD. The role of PT remains critical as it helps recognize and target subtle residual deficits that can persist despite the significant positive impact of early treatment. It also enables the tracking of movement components, function, and musculoskeletal status over time. This facilitates the optimization of early ERT benefits through appropriate exercises that promote optimal muscle activity and selective strengthening, supporting proper alignment, motor development, and function. Initiating treatment as early as possible, even in utero, could potentially address these issues more effectively. A longer follow-up duration is needed for additional assessment of clinical outcomes. Further studies assessing long-term outcomes in a larger cohort of IOPD patients who are treated right after birth on higher dose of ERT are needed to understand the degree of improvement.

Brain glycogen build-up measured by magnetic resonance spectroscopy in classic infantile Pompe disease,"Classic infantile Pompe disease is caused by abnormal lysosomal glycogen accumulation in multiple tissues, including the brain due to a deficit in acid α-glucosidase. Although treatment with recombinant human acid α-glucosidase has dramatically improved survival, recombinant human acid α-glucosidase does not reach the brain, and surviving classic infantile Pompe patients develop progressive cognitive deficits and white matter lesions. We investigated the feasibility of measuring non-invasively glycogen build-up and other metabolic alterations in the brain of classic infantile Pompe patients.

These vary from hearing problems, fasciobulbar weakness, distal muscle weakness<sup><xref rid=""fcae303-B21"" ref-type=""bibr"">21-23</xref></sup> and a decline of processing speed to variations in cognition, ranging from stable and normal to a cognitive decline towards intellectual disability on neuropsychological evaluations (NPEs).<sup><xref rid=""fcae303-B24"" ref-type=""bibr"">24-28</xref></sup> MRI has shown white matter (WM) abnormalities in the brain of classic infantile patients, which progressively spread from the frontal and occipital periventricular WM and centrum semiovale to other brain regions.<sup><xref rid=""fcae303-B24"" ref-type=""bibr"">24</xref></sup> Additionally, recent findings indicate the occurrence of neuroaxonal damage.<sup><xref rid=""fcae303-B29"" ref-type=""bibr"">29-31</xref></sup> Studies using diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) showed a decrease in fractional anisotropy (FA) and an increase in mean diffusivity (MD).<sup><xref rid=""fcae303-B29"" ref-type=""bibr"">29-31</xref></sup> In line with these imaging studies, neurofilament light, a protein of the axonal cytoskeleton, deviates from normal in patients after the age of 5 years.<sup><xref rid=""fcae303-B29"" ref-type=""bibr"">29-31</xref></sup> Conversely in late-onset patients,<sup><xref rid=""fcae303-B31"" ref-type=""bibr"">31</xref>,<xref rid=""fcae303-B32"" ref-type=""bibr"">32</xref></sup> who present some residual enzyme activity, no clinically relevant WM abnormalities were observed on conventional anatomical MR images and using DTI. None of those techniques are however able to directly monitor cellular neurochemistry and particularly measure glycogen accumulation. Proton MR spectroscopy (<sup>1</sup>H MRS) is the most direct method to non-invasively quantify neurometabolite levels.<sup><xref rid=""fcae303-B33"" ref-type=""bibr"">33</xref></sup> Of these neurometabolites, <italic toggle=""yes"">N</italic>-acetyl-aspartate (NAA), typically co-measured with <italic toggle=""yes"">N</italic>-acetyl-aspartyl-glutamate (NAA + NAAG = tNAA), and glutamate (Glu) are predominantly found in neurons; creatine and phosphocreatine (Cr + PCr = tCr) reside in all neural cells; and soluble choline-containing compounds (tCho) and myo-inositol (Ins) are primarily glial markers.<sup><xref rid=""fcae303-B34"" ref-type=""bibr"">34</xref></sup> Changes in metabolite levels have been associated with disease state and are thought to represent different aspects of pathology in many diseases.<sup><xref rid=""fcae303-B35"" ref-type=""bibr"">35</xref></sup> For example, lower tNAA levels and Ins levels have been respectively associated with axonal damage and gliosis in adrenoleukodystrophy.<sup><xref rid=""fcae303-B36"" ref-type=""bibr"">36</xref></sup> A study conducted at 1.5 T in five classic infantile Pompe patients treated with ERT showed changes in NAA/tCr and NAA/tCho levels that may suggest loss of neuronal viability.<sup><xref rid=""fcae303-B37"" ref-type=""bibr"">37</xref></sup> While <sup>1</sup>H MRS has been used to measure glycogen levels in the liver (200–400 μmol/g),<sup><xref rid=""fcae303-B38"" ref-type=""bibr"">38</xref>,<xref rid=""fcae303-B39"" ref-type=""bibr"">39</xref></sup> detection of glycogen in the normal brain is all but impossible due to its very low concentration (3–10 μmol/g).<sup><xref rid=""fcae303-B39"" ref-type=""bibr"">39</xref></sup> To the best of our knowledge, non-invasive <italic toggle=""yes"">in vivo</italic> assessment of glycogen in Pompe patients (in the CNS and other organs) has not been reported. In this study, we used <sup>1</sup>H MRS to provide a non-invasive readout of glycogen accumulation and other neurochemical alterations in the brain of classic infantile Pompe patients.   We demonstrated the feasibility of using <sup>1</sup>H MRS at ultrahigh field (7 T) for detecting glycogen deposition and assessing alterations in the neurochemical profile in the brain of classic infantile Pompe patients. The most salient finding is the detection of an elevated signal in the 3.2–3.8 ppm chemical shift range, which we attribute to glycogen, in the brain of patients, and concomitantly significantly lower tNAA levels (<xref rid=""fcae303-F4"" ref-type=""fig"">Figs 4</xref> and <xref rid=""fcae303-F5"" ref-type=""fig"">5</xref>). This finding was consistent throughout all four patients. Classic infantile Pompe patients are the most severely affected patients in the Pompe disease spectrum and have virtually no residual GAA activity.<sup><xref rid=""fcae303-B1"" ref-type=""bibr"">1-7</xref></sup> ERT is currently the only treatment for Pompe disease; however, it does not cross the BBB and does not treat the CNS pathology. As classic infantile patients now survive thanks to ERT, progressive WM abnormalities and cognitive problems become apparent. Innovative treatment strategies that are currently under development therefore aim to target both muscles and the brain.<sup><xref rid=""fcae303-B24"" ref-type=""bibr"">24-26</xref></sup> The non-invasive approach to detect glycogen accumulation in infantile Pompe disease patients that we show here illustrates the unique potential of <sup>1</sup>H MRS(I) to offer a possible direct, non-invasive readout of disease progression and a possible tool to measure the response to treatment in the CNS. Detection of glycogen using <sup>1</sup>H MRS has previously been demonstrated in phantom<sup><xref rid=""fcae303-B44"" ref-type=""bibr"">44</xref></sup> and in the human liver.<sup><xref rid=""fcae303-B38"" ref-type=""bibr"">38</xref>,<xref rid=""fcae303-B44"" ref-type=""bibr"">44</xref></sup> In the healthy human brain, the low levels of glycogen and its short spin–spin relaxation time (T<sub>2</sub>) make glycogen detection with MRS essentially impossible.<sup><xref rid=""fcae303-B45"" ref-type=""bibr"">45</xref></sup> In our MRS measurements on a glycogen phantom, we were able to detect the signal from the H<sub>3</sub>-H<sub>5</sub> resonances (between 3.2 and 3.8 ppm) (<xref rid=""fcae303-F2"" ref-type=""fig"">Fig. 2</xref>). We used data acquired in a glycogen phantom to fit <italic toggle=""yes"">in vivo</italic> data (<xref rid=""fcae303-F4"" ref-type=""fig"">Fig. 4</xref>, <xref rid=""sup1"" ref-type=""supplementary-material"">Supplementary Fig. 3</xref>). This allowed us to account for the increase in signal in the 3.2–3.8 ppm chemical shift range in all four patients. It is difficult to fully disentangle the contributions of glycogen and glucose to the signal and attribute the increase in signal to glycogen alone. Nonetheless, the accumulation of glycogen we observed is in line with previous post-mortem studies showing deposition of glycogen in various cell types and brain regions in classic infantile patients.<sup><xref rid=""fcae303-B4"" ref-type=""bibr"">4</xref>,<xref rid=""fcae303-B5"" ref-type=""bibr"">5</xref></sup> Lower levels of tNAA, a surrogate measure of mitochondrial and neuronal viability, suggest widespread neuronal dysfunction, which is in line with a previous study.<sup><xref rid=""fcae303-B37"" ref-type=""bibr"">37</xref></sup> It is also in agreement with neuroaxonal damages detected with DTI and changes in neurofilament light levels.<sup><xref rid=""fcae303-B29"" ref-type=""bibr"">29-31</xref></sup> We also observed a higher level of Ins, a glial marker, in the patient population. However, the partial overlap of Ins, Glyc and Glc resonances on the <sup>1</sup>H MR spectrum might bias the quantification of Ins towards an overestimation, a marker of neuroinflammation. Similar to previous findings,<sup><xref rid=""fcae303-B24"" ref-type=""bibr"">24</xref>,<xref rid=""fcae303-B25"" ref-type=""bibr"">25</xref>,<xref rid=""fcae303-B29"" ref-type=""bibr"">29</xref>,<xref rid=""fcae303-B46"" ref-type=""bibr"">46</xref></sup> all four patients showed a decrease of procession speed, as shown by the NPEs (<xref rid=""fcae303-F3"" ref-type=""fig"">Fig. 3</xref>), as well as relatively widespread WM hyperintensities on T<sub>2</sub>-weighted images<sup><xref rid=""fcae303-B24"" ref-type=""bibr"">24</xref>,<xref rid=""fcae303-B25"" ref-type=""bibr"">25</xref>,<xref rid=""fcae303-B29"" ref-type=""bibr"">29</xref>,<xref rid=""fcae303-B46"" ref-type=""bibr"">46</xref></sup> (<xref rid=""fcae303-F1"" ref-type=""fig"">Fig. 1</xref>). A limitation of our study is the relatively small size of our group, associated with the rarity of Pompe disease. All four patients, however, showed similar metabolic alterations. Our measurements were performed using ultrahigh field MRI scanner (7 T), resulting in a higher signal-to-noise ratio compared to similar acquisitions on a clinical scanner operating at 3 or 1.5 T. The Glyc + Glc signal we detected in all four patients was very high, with very low uncertainty per subject. This suggests that glycogen quantification with MRS is possible at clinical field strengths (3 T), and further studies are needed to assess the accuracy of glycogen quantification at fields lower than 7 T. If so, this could allow including MRS(I), together with other biomarkers (e.g. FA/MD obtained with DTI and measurement of neurofilament light measured in serum), in follow-up programmes to capture the CNS involvement in larger, international patient cohorts. This could help to establish a benchmark to evaluate response to next-generation therapies that include the brain as a target. The first radiological signs of brain involvement seen so far in patients with classic infantile Pompe disease are WM abnormalities on structural MRIs. Recent insights in WM disease showed that impaired conduction can lead to a decline of processing speed, slowed cognition and impaired visuospatial functioning, which are also reported in patients with classic infantile Pompe disease.<sup><xref rid=""fcae303-B24"" ref-type=""bibr"">24</xref>,<xref rid=""fcae303-B26"" ref-type=""bibr"">26</xref></sup> Nevertheless, abnormalities in the basal ganglia—subcortical grey matter (GM)—were also reported. GM involvement typically leads to deficits in higher cortical functions such as language that are not seen in classic infantile patients. While GM neuropathology may add to cognitive problems, more insight is needed into the extent and timing of WM and GM involvement in classic infantile Pompe disease and their effect on cognitive functioning. In this study, we chose to focus on a single-volume measurement in a region affected with WM abnormalities and on 2D MRSI measurement in areas with substantial amount of WM abnormalities in all four patients. In a future study, we will focus on areas with less or no WM abnormalities to evaluate if glycogen accumulation precedes WM lesions. All patients included in our study were older than 9 years and showed WM abnormalities on anatomical MR images. One patient showed signs of atrophy. Including younger patients in future studies will allow evaluating the potential relation in time between the development of CNS abnormalities and glycogen accumulation at a younger age. Performing MRI scans on young children can be challenging; however, reports show that the use of a mock scanner to explain and train children (with an age between 4 and 7 years) can greatly reduce anxiety and enable cooperation.<sup><xref rid=""fcae303-B47"" ref-type=""bibr"">47</xref></sup> A longitudinal follow-up study we plan to perform will inform on the correlation between glycogen deposition, measured by MRS, and the extent of cognitive problems and WM abnormalities. Although no clinically relevant WM abnormalities were observed so far in the brain of late-onset patients, a recently published case study in a patient with late-onset Pompe disease did report atrophy of the motoneurons in the medulla and rostral spinal cord as well as ballooning of the lumbar and sacral motoneurons as seen in patients with classic infantile Pompe disease.<sup><xref rid=""fcae303-B48"" ref-type=""bibr"">48</xref></sup> This prompts us to investigate if glycogen could be directly (or not) detected with MRS(I) in late-onset patients. In conclusion, by offering a direct, non-invasive and <italic toggle=""yes"">in vivo</italic> outcome measure of brain involvement in Pompe disease, the use of MRS(I) to monitor glycogen deposition could help to set a benchmark and to serve as an outcome marker in future clinical trials with next-generation therapies.

Association between under-dose of enzyme replacement therapy and quality of life in adults with late-onset Pompe disease in China: A retrospective matched cohort study,,"Pompe disease, also known as glycogen storage disease type Ⅱ, is an inherited metabolic disorder in which a deficiency of the lysosomal enzyme acid α-glucosidase (GAA) leads to accumulations of glycogen in various tissues. All muscle groups of patients can be affected, especially skeletal muscles and respiratory system [<xref rid=""pone.0310534.ref001"" ref-type=""bibr"">1</xref>], increasing the risk of wheelchair or ventilator dependency [<xref rid=""pone.0310534.ref002"" ref-type=""bibr"">2</xref>]. Late-onset Pompe disease can occur at any time in children and adults with a wide spectrum of symptoms and complications [<xref rid=""pone.0310534.ref003"" ref-type=""bibr"">3</xref>–<xref rid=""pone.0310534.ref005"" ref-type=""bibr"">5</xref>], leading to a decline in quality of life [<xref rid=""pone.0310534.ref002"" ref-type=""bibr"">2</xref>], limited ability to work or study [<xref rid=""pone.0310534.ref006"" ref-type=""bibr"">6</xref>], disabilities or even death [<xref rid=""pone.0310534.ref003"" ref-type=""bibr"">3</xref>,<xref rid=""pone.0310534.ref007"" ref-type=""bibr"">7</xref>]. Although Pompe disease is a rare condition, it currently has specific drug treatment, i.e., enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) with alglucosidase alfa. Long-term use of ERT could improve or stabilize ambulation and respiratory function, and reduce mortality among patients with LOPD [<xref rid=""pone.0310534.ref001"" ref-type=""bibr"">1</xref>]. Similar to other orphan drugs for rare diseases, ERT to treat Pompe disease is very expensive. It is estimated that the average annual cost of ERT for an adult with LOPD is approximately RMB 3,000,000 (USD 428,500), which is over four times of the average annual household income in China [<xref rid=""pone.0310534.ref008"" ref-type=""bibr"">8</xref>]. Given the low reimbursement rate of social and commercial insurance for ERT [<xref rid=""pone.0310534.ref008"" ref-type=""bibr"">8</xref>], a heavy financial burden still exists for patients with Pompe disease in China, especially for adult patients who usually need higher doses of ERT determined by body weight in comparison with pediatric patients. Cost-related medication under-dose use is a common clinical practice that occurs in multiple chronic diseases due to financial hardship and inadequate prescription coverage [<xref rid=""pone.0310534.ref009"" ref-type=""bibr"">9</xref>,<xref rid=""pone.0310534.ref010"" ref-type=""bibr"">10</xref>]. Compared with standard-dose use of medications, under-dose use could compromise the efficacy of treatment, and thus increase the risk of disease-related complications, reduced quality of life, and mortality [<xref rid=""pone.0310534.ref011"" ref-type=""bibr"">11</xref>–<xref rid=""pone.0310534.ref013"" ref-type=""bibr"">13</xref>]. In many developed countries, ERT for Pompe disease is fully reimbursed despite its high cost. However, in developing countries like China, insufficient reimbursement is common [<xref rid=""pone.0310534.ref008"" ref-type=""bibr"">8</xref>,<xref rid=""pone.0310534.ref014"" ref-type=""bibr"">14</xref>]. ERT is the only specific pharmacotherapy to treat Pompe disease without any alternative so far. Under these circumstances, Chinese adults with LOPD who are in great needs of ERT would discuss with their physicians and choose to use a reduced dose. By doing this, they could afford it or make their medication supply last longer, just like other chronically ill patients who underuse prescription medications because of cost concerns [<xref rid=""pone.0310534.ref009"" ref-type=""bibr"">9</xref>,<xref rid=""pone.0310534.ref015"" ref-type=""bibr"">15</xref>]. In this patient-physician communication, under-dose use of ERT is a therapeutic decision under nonideal conditions that physicians need to take account of the best interests of their patients not only from a clinical perspective, but also from financial, emotional, and psychosocial perspectives [<xref rid=""pone.0310534.ref016"" ref-type=""bibr"">16</xref>]. Since few adult patients with LOPD used ERT with a standard dose in China, it is important to assess whether under-dose use of ERT could improve or stabilize health outcomes from a patient perspective compared with receiving no ERT. Under this circumstance, quality of life (QoL) is a suitable outcome measure that provides a multidimensional perspective of an individual’s subjective perception on health [<xref rid=""pone.0310534.ref017"" ref-type=""bibr"">17</xref>]. Several previous studies have focused on the effect of ERT on QoL among patients with LOPD [<xref rid=""pone.0310534.ref018"" ref-type=""bibr"">18</xref>,<xref rid=""pone.0310534.ref019"" ref-type=""bibr"">19</xref>]. Nonetheless, to our best knowledge, no studies have been conducted to examine the association between under-dose ERT and QoL among adult patients with LOPD. The primary objective of this study is to compare the change of QoL between adults with LOPD receiving under-dose ERT and no ERT. The secondary objective is to identify factors associated with the change of QoL.  In total, 304 Pompe disease patients registered in CPCC, 192 of whom were adult patients with LOPD. Among 82 participants who completed two investigations at baseline and follow-up, 70 were not using ERT at baseline or before. When assessing ERT status during follow-up, all the 11 participants who chose to use the medication were considered as under-dose ERT users, while 59 participants were not using ERT.

Female sex was associated with a decline in EQ-5D VAS (β = -22.79, <italic toggle=""yes"">p</italic> = 0.002).  A dynamic monitoring of QoL among adults with LOPD receiving under-dose ERT is necessary. Meanwhile, a Pompe-disease specific instrument should be developed based on patient experiences so that it could be sensitive enough to capture the changes of functioning and improve monitoring of QoL on a routine basis. Among patients with severe under-dose ERT, it is desirable to discuss with physicians whether to adjust treatment strategies. Customized interventions are needed to improve QoL in vulnerable subgroups, including female and unemployed people. ",N/A,17 9 2024
An expert rule-based approach for identifying infantile-onset Pompe disease patients using retrospective electronic health records,"Pompe disease (OMIM #232300), a rare genetic disorder, leads to glycogen buildup in the body due to an enzyme deficiency, particularly harming the heart and muscles. Infantile-onset Pompe disease (IOPD) requires urgent treatment to prevent mortality, but the unavailability of these methods often delays diagnosis. Our study aims to streamline IOPD diagnosis in the UAE using electronic health records (EHRs) for faster, more accurate detection and timely treatment initiation. This study utilized electronic health records from the Abu Dhabi Healthcare Company (SEHA) healthcare network in the UAE to develop an expert rule-based screening approach operationalized through a dashboard. The study encompassed six diagnosed IOPD patients and screened 93,365 subjects. Expert rules were formulated to identify potential high-risk IOPD patients based on their age, particular symptoms, and creatine kinase levels. The proposed approach was evaluated using accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity. The proposed approach accurately identified five true positives, one false negative, and four false positive IOPD cases. The false negative case involved a patient with both Pompe disease and congenital heart disease. The focus on CHD led to the overlooking of Pompe disease, exacerbated by no measurement of creatine kinase. The false positive cases were diagnosed with Mitochondrial DNA depletion syndrome 12-A (<italic toggle=""yes"">SLC25A4</italic> gene), Immunodeficiency-71 (<italic toggle=""yes"">ARPC1B</italic> mutation), Niemann–Pick disease type C (<italic toggle=""yes"">NPC1</italic> gene mutation leading to frameshift), and Group B Streptococcus meningitis. The proposed approach of integrating expert rules with a dashboard facilitated efficient data visualization and automated patient screening, which aids in the early detection of Pompe disease. Future studies are encouraged to investigate the application of machine learning methodologies to enhance further the precision and efficiency of identifying patients with IOPD.","Pompe disease (OMIM #232300), also referred to as acid maltase deficiency (AMD) or glycogen storage disease type II (GSDII), is a rare and severe autosomal recessive lysosomal storage disorder arising from inadequate activity of the enzyme acid alpha-glucosidase (GAA)<sup><xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR1"">1</xref>,<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR2"">2</xref></sup>. This deficiency, attributed to mutations in the GAA gene, disrupts the breakdown of glycogen into glucose within lysosomes, causing its accumulation across various tissues, prominently in skeletal and cardiac muscles and the liver and neurons. Characterized as a progressive lysosomal storage disorder, Pompe disease can be fatal, with the lysosomal build-up of glycogen primarily occurring in cardiac and skeletal muscles alongside the nervous system, thereby inducing cellular dysfunction and consequent muscle damage<sup><xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR3"">3</xref>–<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR5"">5</xref></sup> The incidence and prevalence of Pompe disease vary in reported estimates, with the traditional figure suggesting an overall incidence of 1 in 40,000 live births. Specifically, infantile-onset Pompe disease (IOPD) has an incidence of 1 in 52,000, while the combined incidence for both IOPD and late-onset Pompe disease (LOPD) is approximately 1 in 17,000. However, prospective trials indicate a potentially higher incidence of around 1 in 9000 for both forms of the disease. These statistics underscore the rarity of Pompe disease, with the traditional distribution indicating roughly 3/4 of cases as LOPD and 1/4 as IOPD<sup><xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR3"">3</xref>–<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR8"">8</xref></sup>. The Pompe disease exhibits two distinct clinical forms: IOPD, typically marked by symptoms emerging within the first year of life, including muscle weakness, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, hypotonia, respiratory insufficiency, and a high risk of fatality without prompt Enzyme Replacement Therapy (ERT); and LOPD, which manifests after the age of one, often without cardiomyopathy, leading to a more variable and insidious progression involving skeletal muscles, potentially leading to respiratory failure and wheelchair confinement. This disorder’s clinical spectrum ranges from severe cardiac and muscle dysfunction in IOPD to primarily muscular involvement in LOPD, which can manifest from infancy to late adulthood<sup><xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR3"">3</xref>–<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR5"">5</xref>,<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR7"">7</xref>,<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR8"">8</xref></sup>. ERT using alglucosidase alfa, such as Myozyme®, is one of the methods of treating Pompe disease, which increases GAA activity in muscles, the heart, and the liver, resulting in glycogen clearance in cardiac and liver muscles. Its approval in 2006 for childhood forms and in 2010 for adult forms has significantly altered the disease’s prognosis, with clinical improvements observed post-treatment, albeit varying based on residual enzyme levels. Recent studies have shown the safety and efficacy of avalglucosidase alfa for IOPD<sup><xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR9"">9</xref></sup>. While Pompe disease patients are not fully cured, ERT with recombinant human GAA is currently the sole specific treatment, demonstrating enhanced and ventilator-free survival, mainly when initiated earlier, as indicated by a pivotal 2006 study. Clinical trials continue to assess ERT’s safety and efficacy, underscoring its pivotal role in managing this challenging condition<sup><xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR3"">3</xref>–<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR8"">8</xref></sup>. Newborn screening (NBS) has been implemented in some countries for early diagnosis of IOPD. While various governments have invested in fully or partially subsidized NBS programs across different regions globally, it remains unavailable universally. This limitation leaves a gap, failing to identify patients who might have been previously missed. Notably, there is a drawback to the NBS approach: the high rate of false positives, for example, due to the presence of pseudo-deficiency alleles<sup><xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR10"">10</xref></sup>. Despite this drawback, NBS provides a significant advantage by ensuring there are no false negatives. Furthermore, NBS also poses several challenges for families. Initial communication about abnormal results can be distressing, and the waiting period for confirmatory diagnosis intensifies anxiety. Many parents seeking information turn to online sources, often encountering alarming data. The emotional impact is heightened for postpartum mothers, and the uncertainty post-diagnosis leads to parental hypervigilance about their child’s health. Additionally, the early diagnosis can induce anticipatory grief, challenges in acceptance, and the medicalization of an asymptomatic child, complicating the family’s journey to normalcy<sup><xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR11"">11</xref></sup>. Additionally, the challenge is magnified by the requirement to manually screen thousands of patients to pinpoint a single suspected individual<sup><xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR12"">12</xref></sup>. This inefficiency is further complicated by the genetic variances in IOPD patients, wherein the disease manifestation correlates with their genotype, precisely the GAA activity level, challenging the accuracy of NBS programs<sup><xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR13"">13</xref></sup>. Although NBS programs are offered in the UAE, newborns are not screened for Pompe disease<sup><xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR14"">14</xref></sup>. Despite the substantial financial and resource investment in these programs, the risk of misdiagnosis remains, evidenced by the fact that IOPD patients can wait an average of 2.5 months for an accurate diagnosis<sup><xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR12"">12</xref></sup>. Tragically, this delay can be life-threatening, given that the average age of death for these patients is reported at 8.7 months, with a mere 25.7% survival rate at 12 months<sup><xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR15"">15</xref></sup>. There is, however, potential for leveraging automation to address this issue. EHRs encompass an extensive compilation of healthcare information about every patient. Consequently, EHRs are an abundant source of historical data that is already accessible within most healthcare facilities and falls in line with established protocols<sup><xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR12"">12</xref></sup>. Automated screening using an expert rules-based approach and preprocessed EHRs offers the promise of large-scale, accurate IOPD patient screening. Such an approach could streamline patient selection efforts without altering existing workflows, potentially increasing cost-effectiveness and enhancing the timely discovery and diagnosis of IOPD patients. Considering the limited lifespan of untreated IOPD patients, the limitations of conventional diagnostic methods, and the absence of Pompe screening in the UAE, our study seeks to detail the primary demographic and clinical traits of UAE-based IOPD patients using EHRs. In addition, we aim to introduce expert rules created by expert clinicians and an easy-to-use dashboard that employs the expert rules to identify potential high-risk IOPD patients.<fig id=""Fig1""><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Methodology of this study.</p></caption><graphic http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink href=""41598_2024_72259_Fig1_HTML"" id=""MO1""></graphic></fig> Given the paramount importance of early and accurate diagnosis of IOPD to enhance patient outcomes, we developed a robust methodology that leverages EHRs and expert rule-based algorithms. The subsequent section details the methodological framework employed in this study. We applied the rule-based algorithm curated by a domain expert. Based on the expert rules and data, we developed a PowerBI dashboard to visualize and evaluate the performance of the expert rules. The methodology followed in this study is shown in Fig. <xref rid=""Fig1"" ref-type=""fig"">1</xref>. All experimental work was conducted on a computer with the following specifications: Ryzen 9 5950X, RTX 3090 24GB, and 128GB DDR4 RAM.<table-wrap id=""Tab1""><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>EHR document types and their description.</p></caption><table frame=""hsides"" rules=""groups""><thead><tr><th align=""left"">Document type</th><th align=""left"">Description of document</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align=""left"">Clinical</td><td align=""left"">A detailed record of clinical events associated with specific patients during medical encounters</td></tr><tr><td align=""left"">Demographics</td><td align=""left"">Patient demographic information, such as gender, nationality, and date of birth</td></tr><tr><td align=""left"">Diagnosis</td><td align=""left"">The medical conditions diagnosed and the corresponding diagnostic codes assigned to a patient during an outpatient medical visit</td></tr><tr><td align=""left"">Drugs</td><td align=""left"">Medications prescribed to patients by healthcare providers during a medical appointment</td></tr><tr><td align=""left"">Encounter</td><td align=""left"">Individual patient hospital admission details, including the date the encounter began, the date it concluded, and any accompanying discharge notes</td></tr><tr><td align=""left"">Labs</td><td align=""left"">Results of ordered lab tests</td></tr><tr><td align=""left"">Orders</td><td align=""left"">A comprehensive record of various clinical orders placed for patients during their medical encounters</td></tr><tr><td align=""left"">Problems</td><td align=""left"">The simultaneous record of a patient’s ongoing medical conditions, as documented by healthcare providers during medical appointments</td></tr><tr><td align=""left"">Procedures</td><td align=""left"">Procedures ordered by clinicians for patients during an encounter</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap> The study comprises 6 IOPD patients and screened 93,365 subjects. First, exploring the data presents the gender distribution of patients, revealing three males and three females among the IOPD group. In contrast, the screened subjects consisted of 48789 males and 44,404 females. Figure <xref rid=""Fig2"" ref-type=""fig"">2</xref> presents a world map showing the population distribution of patients in this study, where the star marker represents IOPD patients. As can be seen from the map, the patient population shows homogeneity, as the majority of the study population appears to be from the West Asia region. We reviewed past literature to explore symptoms of IOPD mentioned by medical field experts to explore and understand the clinical manifestations. Our findings show that IOPD has a broad spectrum of symptoms. However, the following symptoms were the most common symptoms identified and discussed in the past literature<sup><xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR19"">19</xref>–<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR28"">28</xref></sup>: cardiomegaly, hypotonia, feeding difficulties, respiratory infections, ventilator dependence (breathing difficulties), cardiomyopathy, muscle weakness, and elevated levels of CK. We explored the data to analyze the distribution of the symptoms mentioned above for patients in our data. Our findings are summarized in Figs. <xref rid=""Fig3"" ref-type=""fig"">3</xref> and <xref rid=""Fig4"" ref-type=""fig"">4</xref>. Figure <xref rid=""Fig3"" ref-type=""fig"">3</xref> compares the CK levels in IOPD patients versus screened patients, which revealed significant differences, underscoring the profound impact of this genetic disorder on muscular integrity. The mean CK level in IOPD patients was markedly higher (418.0 U/L) than in the screened group (245.17 U/L), indicating an elevated muscle damage or turnover baseline in the IOPD patients, which is consistent with the known pathophysiology of IOPD, where lysosomal dysfunction leads to glycogen accumulation in muscle tissues, resulting in cellular damage<sup><xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR29"">29</xref></sup>. Figure <xref rid=""Fig4"" ref-type=""fig"">4</xref> presents the prevalence of symptoms identified in the reviewed literature in our dataset. It can be noted that cardiomegaly and cardiomyopathy are the most prevalent symptoms in IOPD patients, which aligns with IOPD’s characteristic of causing hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. Feeding difficulties, hypotonia, and respiratory infections are also significantly more common in IOPD patients compared to screened subjects. In this study, muscle weakness and ventilator dependence were not observed among the IOPD patients. This absence of reported cases is because none of the patients diagnosed with IOPD presented with these specific symptoms during our research period and data.<fig id=""Fig4""><label>Figure 4</label><caption><p>Prevalence of symptoms in IOPD and screened patients.</p></caption><graphic http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink href=""41598_2024_72259_Fig4_HTML"" id=""MO4""></graphic></fig> In addition to the <inline-formula id=""IEq2""><alternatives><tex-math id=""M3"">\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}

This phenomenon is not uncommon in large datasets or complex medical conditions and underscores the importance of considering both effect size (Cramer’s V) and statistical significance (<italic toggle=""yes"">p</italic>-value) in interpretation. For instance, cardiomegaly [I51.7] shows a Cramer’s V of 0.052 but is statistically significant, indicating a weak but non-random association with Pompe disease. Building upon the insights from Cramer’s V analysis, we progressed to a more focused feature selection phase to identify potential markers strongly associated with Pompe disease. In our study, we used the importance of the RF feature to find the most important symptoms (features) associated with IOPD. This method helped us pinpoint which symptoms are most strongly linked to the disease. RF feature importance technique is good at identifying the most important features without getting confused by the less important ones. The most important features identified through this method were Cardiomyopathy, Unspecified [I42.9], Other Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy [I42.2], Pneumonia Due to Other Specified Bacteria [J15.8], Congenital Hypotonia [P94.2], Enterovirus Infection, Unspecified [B34.1], Other Viral Infections of Unspecified Site [B34.8], Chronic Systolic (Congestive) Heart Failure [I50.22], Acute On Chronic Combined Systolic (Congestive) And Diastolic (Congestive) Heart Failure [I50.43], Dilated Cardiomyopathy [I42.0], Unspecified Lack of Expected Normal Physiological Development in Childhood [R62.50]. Figure <xref rid=""Fig6"" ref-type=""fig"">6</xref> presents an analytical delineation of symptoms associated with IOPD identified by an RF feature importance analysis. The symptoms are represented by bars, with the intensity of the green color distinguishing between the commonality of symptoms and their identification by the RF analysis alone. The dark green bars denote symptoms identified by the Random Forest feature importance method and are widely reported in the literature, affirming their established presence in IOPD clinical profiles. Conditions such as “Cardiomyopathy” and “Other Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy” exhibit the most significant prominence, underscoring their significance in the disease’s symptomatology.<fig id=""Fig6""><label>Figure 6</label><caption><p>Top 20 important features identified by Random Forest feature selection.</p></caption><graphic http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink href=""41598_2024_72259_Fig6_HTML"" id=""MO6""></graphic></fig> We further applied the RF feature importance test to each unique symptom identified through RF to explore their associations with other symptoms. Figures <xref rid=""Fig7"" ref-type=""fig"">7</xref>,  <xref rid=""Fig8"" ref-type=""fig"">8</xref> and <xref rid=""Fig9"" ref-type=""fig"">9</xref> presents network diagrams to illustrate the relationship between all identified symptoms in the feature importance analysis and all other symptoms available in the dataset. The dark blue nodes, as central nodes, represent the primary symptoms of IOPD as identified through feature importance analysis. The yellow nodes are secondary symptoms associated with the primary IOPD symptoms, as identified through the same analysis. Their connection to the central nodes suggests a clinical association that may be consequential or contributory to the presentation of the primary symptoms. These associations may not be causal but could indicate common comorbidities or complications arising from the primary symptoms of IOPD. The complete network diagram can be accessed here <ext-link ext-link-type=""uri"" http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink href=""https://zahir2000.github.io/pompe.github.io/network"">https://zahir2000.github.io/pompe.github.io/network</ext-link>. The network diagram depicted in Fig. <xref rid=""Fig7"" ref-type=""fig"">7</xref> represents the complex cardiac complications that can arise due to the progressive nature of this lysosomal storage disorder. IOPD often leads to cardiac hypertrophy and progressively impairs cardiac function. The central node, “Unspecified Combined Systolic and Diastolic Heart Failure”, indicates the co-occurrence of both systolic (the heart’s ability to pump blood) and diastolic (the heart’s ability to fill with blood) dysfunction, which is particularly challenging to manage in IOPD due to the glycogen accumulation in the heart muscle. Adjacent to this is “Acute on Chronic Combined Systolic and Diastolic Heart Failure”, denoting an acute decompensation superimposed on chronic heart failure. The progression to “Chronic Systolic Heart Failure” reflects a deterioration of the heart’s pumping ability, a common consequence of the disease’s impact on cardiac muscle. Moreover, “Secondary Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension” can develop as a result of chronic heart failure, leading to increased pressure in the pulmonary arteries, and is linked to both chronic systolic heart failure and the central node, suggesting it is a common sequela in IOPD patients. This condition can further exacerbate the burden on the heart and complicate the clinical management of patients. Lastly, the node “Acute on Chronic Systolic Heart Failure” captures the episodic worsening of heart function that children with IOPD may experience.<fig id=""Fig7""><label>Figure 7</label><caption><p>Symptomatic networks in infantile onset Pompe disease: A Random Forest feature importance analysis identifying core symptoms and related conditions (Cluster 1).</p></caption><graphic http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink href=""41598_2024_72259_Fig7_HTML"" id=""MO7""></graphic></fig> The network diagram presented in Fig. <xref rid=""Fig8"" ref-type=""fig"">8</xref> underscores the susceptibility of IOPD patients to respiratory infections due to compromised diaphragmatic and intercostal muscle function. The central node, representing ‘Other Viral Infections of Unspecified Site’, could indicate the various respiratory viruses that patients with IOPD are at risk for, considering their already weakened respiratory systems. Connections to specific conditions such as adenovirus infection, which can lead to acute upper respiratory infections and enterovirus infection, highlight the complexity and severity of managing IOPD patients who may develop these infections. The further association with conditions such as ‘Unspecified Asthma with Exacerbation’ and ‘Unspecified Bacterial Pneumonia’ demonstrates the potential for viral infections to exacerbate underlying respiratory conditions or lead to secondary bacterial infections.<fig id=""Fig8""><label>Figure 8</label><caption><p>Symptomatic networks in infantile onset Pompe disease: A Random Forest feature importance analysis identifying core symptoms and related conditions (Cluster 2).</p></caption><graphic http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink href=""41598_2024_72259_Fig8_HTML"" id=""MO8""></graphic></fig> The central node in the network diagram shown in Fig. <xref rid=""Fig9"" ref-type=""fig"">9</xref>, “Cardiomyopathy”, is significant as IOPD often involves cardiac issues such as hypertrophic cardiomyopathy due to glycogen accumulation in the heart muscle. This can progress to dilated cardiomyopathy, as represented in the diagram, and be associated with conditions like myocarditis, which can complicate cardiomyopathy. The link to “Congenital Hypotonia” underscores the muscle weakness seen in IOPD, which can lead to motor function delays and other developmental issues. The diagram also includes respiratory conditions like pneumonia due to Streptococcus pneumoniae and other specific bacteria, for which patients with IOPD are at increased risk due to compromised respiratory muscles. Acute bronchitis and acute respiratory failure are connected, highlighting the respiratory complications that are a common cause of morbidity in IOPD. The presence of “Wheezing” further denotes respiratory distress. Furthermore, the nodes related to family indicate the hereditary nature of IOPD, and the inclusion of gastrointestinal appliance fitting suggests the feeding difficulties and nutritional support often required by these patients. Acknowledging the rapidly progressive nature of IOPD, which often results in mortality within the first year of life due to cardiac and ventilatory failure, our study developed a new set of expert-derived rules. The expert rules are designed to augment the efficiency of physicians by refining the patient review process within EHRs. By preemptively identifying and flagging potential cases of IOPD, these rules enable healthcare providers to concentrate their review efforts on a targeted subset of patients. This alleviates the workload for clinicians by diminishing the need for extensive manual chart reviews and significantly conserves time-a critical factor considering the urgent need for rapid treatment initiation in IOPD. Early intervention is critical, as the condition is aggressively progressive, often resulting in mortality within the first year of life if left untreated. Therefore, implementing these expert rules is not merely an administrative convenience but a vital measure to expedite the diagnostic process, enhancing the likelihood of timely therapeutic intervention for IOPD patients. Algorithm 1 presents the logical flow of the expert rules. For a patient to fall under consideration based on these rules, they must be 12 months of age or younger, which aligns with the “infantile onset” classification of Pompe disease, marking a period where the disease’s severe symptoms typically emerge. Rule 1 focuses on the co-occurrence of cardiomyopathy and hypotonia, which are hallmark features of IOPD, reflecting the disease’s profound impact on cardiac and skeletal muscle function. Rule 2’s emphasis on delayed physiological development alongside cardiomyopathy captures the broad spectrum of clinical manifestations, recognizing how Pompe disease can affect overall infant growth and development. Rule 3 leverages the diagnostic value of elevated creatine kinase levels-a marker of muscle damage-combined with cardiomyopathy to identify potential cases based on biochemical evidence of muscle dysfunction. Rules 4 and 5 extend the diagnostic framework to include feeding difficulties and recurrent respiratory or chest infections, respectively, in the aforementioned conditions. These additions acknowledge the multi-systemic nature of IOPD, where feeding and respiratory challenges often compound the primary muscular and cardiac symptoms.<fig id=""Fig9""><label>Figure 9</label><caption><p>Symptomatic networks in infantile onset Pompe disease: A Random Forest feature importance analysis identifying core symptoms and related conditions (Cluster 3).</p></caption><graphic http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink href=""41598_2024_72259_Fig9_HTML"" id=""MO9""></graphic></fig>

 The efficacy of the expert rules is further evident when we explore the associations presented in the network diagrams based on the data used in this study in Figs. <xref rid=""Fig7"" ref-type=""fig"">7</xref>,  <xref rid=""Fig8"" ref-type=""fig"">8</xref> and <xref rid=""Fig9"" ref-type=""fig"">9</xref>. As shown in Fig. <xref rid=""Fig9"" ref-type=""fig"">9</xref>, there is a direct association between cardiomyopathy and congenital hypotonia. This combination of conditions is the first rule in the expert-derived rules. The second rule is the indirect association between an unspecified lack of expected normal physiological development in childhood and cardiomyopathy conditions. Next, pneumonia due to other specified bacteria, a respiratory infection, is directly associated with other hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, the last rule in the expert-derived rules. The study employed a thoroughly designed dashboard to expedite the identification process of IOPD patients using a set of expert-derived rules. Purpose-built to enhance user experience, the dashboard’s layout allows for the seamless visualization of complex patient data, facilitating quick and informed decision-making. As presented in Fig. <xref rid=""Fig10"" ref-type=""fig"">10</xref>, the dashboard features an organized table that displays patient identifiers, associated diagnostic codes, creatine kinase levels, and the outcomes predicted by the expert rules. It also includes a confusion matrix that explains the performance of the expert rules. Data categories within the dashboard are deliberately chosen for relevance to IOPD diagnosis, including a range of symptoms and biochemical markers such as creatine kinase levels. The expert rules, previously delineated, are integrated within the dashboard, providing a structured approach to patient screening. The performance of these rules is quantified using accuracy metrics-specifically, accuracy, specificity, and sensitivity measures-which are critical in evaluating the reliability of the diagnostic criteria. Descriptive analytics enrich the dashboard, offering a count of patients meeting each symptom criterion and a confusion matrix providing a breakdown of true positives, false positives, true negatives, and false negatives. Enhanced interactivity is a hallmark of this tool; users can filter patient data by age or specific conditions, toggle the display to focus on various predictive outcomes and identify which patients satisfy any given rule. This adaptability makes the dashboard an invaluable asset in navigating the data landscape. As detailed in the methodology, the dashboard development utilized PowerBI for its robust data visualization capabilities and SQL for data manipulation, ensuring high precision and user engagement. The implications of such a tool for research are profound. The dashboard streamlines the data analysis process and provides a flexible platform for generating insights and flagging patients for review. It embodies a significant advancement in the utilization of clinical data, offering a potent means to leverage expert knowledge in the pursuit of improved patient outcomes.<fig id=""Fig10""><label>Figure 10</label><caption><p>Developed dashboard with integrated expert rules.</p></caption><graphic http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink href=""41598_2024_72259_Fig10_HTML"" id=""MO11""></graphic></fig> Upon implementing the expert rules into the dashboard, our study delineated five true positives (TP) instances of IOPD, one false negative (FN), and four high-risk patients for Pompe disease out of the patients within the extracted EHRs. The expert physician manually reviewed the flagged patients. The true positive cases reaffirm the efficacy of the expert rules in accurately detecting IOPD. Conversely, the false negatives represent instances where the rules did not flag the diagnosis. The case pertained to a patient with concomitant Pompe disease and congenital heart disease, manifesting as ventricular septal defect, patent ductus arteriosus, and atrial septal defect, a clinical emphasis on CHD, overshadowing the Pompe disease diagnosis. Notably, an absence of CK measurement further contributed to the oversight. The high-risk cases for Pompe disease were evaluated and found to have the following diseases: Mitochondrial DNA depletion syndrome 12-A linked to the <italic toggle=""yes"">SLC25A4</italic> gene, Immunodeficiency-71 characterized by a mutation in <italic toggle=""yes"">ARPC1B</italic> c.392+1G>C, Niemann-Pick disease type C resulting from a mutation in the <italic toggle=""yes"">NPC1</italic> gene (c.2972_2973delAG) leading to a frameshift (p.Gln99Argfs*15), and Group B Streptococcus (GBS) meningitis. Next, using the dashboard, we identified a single patient with elevated CK levels, hypotonia, and physiological development. Upon reviewing the patient’s records, it was found that the patient had suffered severe hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy, indicative of significant oxygen deprivation and consequential brain injury. Afterward, we identified patients with cardiomyopathy (true negative cases only) using the dashboard, as cardiomyopathy is the most common and obvious marker. The expert physician manually reviewed the records of the identified patients, and the review results are presented in Table <xref rid=""Tab2"" ref-type=""table"">2</xref>. The review shows that none of the (true negative) patients with cardiomyopathy alone have IOPD disease, further proving the efficacy of the expert rules. Our expert rule-based method has significant potential to enhance clinical practice through its integration into existing EHR systems. The system can automatically analyze patient data against predefined criteria for identifying IOPD by embedding these rules using programming languages such as Python or SQL. When patient data meets these criteria, the system generates alerts within the EHR, notifying the attending physician or clinical team to review the case. This automation not only streamlines the identification process but also ensures timely intervention. Furthermore, the expert rules can be incorporated into Clinical Decision Support (CDS) tools, which provide real-time feedback and suggestions to clinicians based on patient data. These tools can link to relevant clinical guidelines and research articles, enhancing the clinician’s understanding and supporting informed decision-making. Training sessions will ensure clinicians and staff can interpret and act on these alerts effectively. This training can be integrated into routine clinical education programs. The successful implementation of this method depends significantly on the quality and comprehensiveness of the hospital’s data. The expert rules are most effective when the hospital’s EHR contains detailed patient records, including the symptoms specified in the expert rules. There is no predefined method for applying these rules; implementing the logic that underpins them correctly is key. Each healthcare institution may need to tailor the rules to fit their specific data structures and clinical workflows. Implementing this method requires a collaborative effort between IT staff, clinical informaticians, and healthcare providers to ensure accurate integration and clinical relevance. Continuous monitoring, feedback collection, and regular audits will be crucial for refining the rules and improving their performance. This iterative process will help optimize the system’s effectiveness in identifying and managing IOPD cases. By leveraging this expert rule-based approach, healthcare institutions can improve the accuracy and timeliness of IOPD diagnosis and treatment, ultimately leading to better patient outcomes and more efficient use of healthcare resources. As discussed above, our study’s findings highlight significant insights into the early detection and diagnosis of IOPD using EHR-based expert rules.

The expert rules-based dashboard identified five true positive cases of IOPD using the EHRs, underscoring the effectiveness of the expert rules in capturing clinically verified instances of the disease. Despite the success in identifying true positives, the expert rules also yielded one false negative, illustrating the system’s limitations in detecting instances where a patient has two genetic diseases. Four potential cases were identified, representing differential diagnoses that phenotypically mimic IOPD, thus presenting a challenge to the specificity of the rule-based system. The manual review of flagged cases by expert physicians confirmed the reliability of the expert rules. Nevertheless, it also revealed the critical role of comprehensive follow-up and the importance of incorporating a range of diagnostic measures to ensure accuracy. The dashboard, designed with user-centric principles and constructed via PowerBI, proved instrumental in visualizing complex patient data and the expert rules’ performance. This tool enabled efficient data interaction, allowing healthcare providers to filter and review patient information promptly. Statistical analyses reinforced the utility of the dashboard, with cardiomyopathy and hypotonia emerging as significant indicators of IOPD, as evidenced by elevated creatine kinase levels and the presence of specific cardiomyopathies. Incorporating machine learning techniques such as Random Forest feature importance analysis provided further depth to our understanding, identifying a spectrum of symptoms highly indicative of IOPD. In conclusion, our research demonstrates the transformative potential of a rule-based dashboard in the realm of IOPD diagnosis. This study contributes to the prompt recognition and treatment of rare genetic disorders within a regional healthcare system by streamlining the identification process and providing a model for future diagnostic frameworks. We have to mention that our rule-based algorithm is not superior to NBS, as it requires the patient to have specific symptoms. However, it is an alternative method of detection of IOPD in regions where NBS for IOPD is not offered. In the future, a machine learning approach would be interesting to experiment with as it may offer a more nuanced ability to discern patterns within large datasets, potentially improving the accuracy and efficiency of IOPD diagnosis beyond the capabilities of traditional rule-based systems. However, the data imbalance within the dataset will be a considerable challenge when experimenting with machine learning. A common challenge in researching rare diseases is the notably limited sample size of positive cases, which complicates the conduct of statistical analyses. On the other hand, manipulating such a large dataset (due to the large number of screened patients) was computationally exhaustive for a personal computer, as it was evident from the duration between command and code execution in developing and using the PowerBI dashboard and Python programming.",N/A,14 9 2024
"Mutation Spectrum of <italic toggle=""yes"">GAA</italic> Gene in Pompe Disease: Current Knowledge and Results of an Italian Study","Studying a patient with Pompe disease (PD) is like opening Pandora’s box. The specialist is faced with numerous clinical features similar to those of several diseases, and very often the symptoms are well hidden and none is associated with this rare disease. In recent years, scientific interest in this disease has been growing more and more, but still no symptom is recognized as key to a correct diagnosis of it, nor is there any specific disease marker to date. New diagnostic/therapeutic proposals on disease allow for the diffusion of knowledge of this pathology for timely diagnosis of the patient. Due to unawareness and difficulty in diagnosis, many adults with PD are diagnosed with great delay. In this article, we report and discuss current knowledge of PD and provide new data from work conducted on a cohort of 2934 Italian subjects recruited in recent years. A genetic analysis of the <italic toggle=""yes"">GAA</italic> gene was performed on patients with significant clinical signs and pathological enzyme activity to define the genetic profile of subjects. This identified 39 symptomatic PD subjects with low acid alpha-glucosidase enzyme activity and the presence of two causative mutations in <italic toggle=""yes"">GAA</italic> gene regions. Furthermore, 22 subjects with genetic variants of uncertain significance (GVUS) were identified.","The lives of patients and families facing the challenges of rare and/or severely disabling diseases have changed compared to 20 years ago. Clinicians spend a lot of time studying their symptoms and trying to understand how to approach patients’ problems. But sometimes that is not so easy. Time has a significant impact on clinician’s efforts and attention. This restriction could result in the clinician identifying the disease incorrectly and misdiagnosing it. Glycogenosis type II, also known as Pompe disease (PD), is an autosomal recessive disorder caused by mutations in the <italic toggle=""yes"">GAA</italic> gene, localized on chromosome 17, that lead to a deficiency in the acid alpha-glucosidase enzyme (<italic toggle=""yes"">GAA</italic>-enzyme). This disease leads to an accumulation of glycogen in lysosomes [<xref rid=""B1-ijms-25-09139"" ref-type=""bibr"">1</xref>,<xref rid=""B2-ijms-25-09139"" ref-type=""bibr"">2</xref>,<xref rid=""B3-ijms-25-09139"" ref-type=""bibr"">3</xref>], which injures the heart, leg and arm muscles, and the muscles of respiration [<xref rid=""B4-ijms-25-09139"" ref-type=""bibr"">4</xref>]. Pompe disease is classified by age of onset, organ involvement, and severity and rate of progression. It presents two spectra of phenotypes named infantile-onset Pompe disease (IOPD) and late-onset Pompe disease (LOPD), with an incidence of 40,000–50,000 in European and American populations [<xref rid=""B5-ijms-25-09139"" ref-type=""bibr"">5</xref>,<xref rid=""B6-ijms-25-09139"" ref-type=""bibr"">6</xref>,<xref rid=""B7-ijms-25-09139"" ref-type=""bibr"">7</xref>,<xref rid=""B8-ijms-25-09139"" ref-type=""bibr"">8</xref>]. The infantile form, the most severe, is characterized by early-age onset, severe hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, marked hypotonia, macroglossia, hepatomegaly, it usually presents in the first days or weeks of life, and it has an invariably fatal outcome within one year of age. The late-onset form (juvenile or adult) is characterized by skeletal myopathy, fatigue, muscle weakness, hyperCKemia and possible respiratory failure [<xref rid=""B9-ijms-25-09139"" ref-type=""bibr"">9</xref>,<xref rid=""B10-ijms-25-09139"" ref-type=""bibr"">10</xref>,<xref rid=""B11-ijms-25-09139"" ref-type=""bibr"">11</xref>]. The time of onset and phenotypes of LOPD are variable, and patients are likely to have manifestations from the fifth decade of life [<xref rid=""B4-ijms-25-09139"" ref-type=""bibr"">4</xref>,<xref rid=""B12-ijms-25-09139"" ref-type=""bibr"">12</xref>,<xref rid=""B13-ijms-25-09139"" ref-type=""bibr"">13</xref>,<xref rid=""B14-ijms-25-09139"" ref-type=""bibr"">14</xref>,<xref rid=""B15-ijms-25-09139"" ref-type=""bibr"">15</xref>]. Mutations in the <italic toggle=""yes"">GAA</italic> gene, inherited in an autosomal recessive way, are very heterogeneous. They can be point mutations that can affect the functionality and stability of the protein or the splicing process, or small and large deletions and insertions [<xref rid=""B16-ijms-25-09139"" ref-type=""bibr"">16</xref>,<xref rid=""B17-ijms-25-09139"" ref-type=""bibr"">17</xref>,<xref rid=""B18-ijms-25-09139"" ref-type=""bibr"">18</xref>]. Taverna et al. reported that <italic toggle=""yes"">GAA</italic> variants are clustered in three critical regions of the gene: exon 2, which contains the start codon exons 10 and 11, which encode for the catalytic site, and exon 14 which encodes for a highly conserved region of <italic toggle=""yes"">GAA</italic> protein [<xref rid=""B17-ijms-25-09139"" ref-type=""bibr"">17</xref>]. The Pompe disease <italic toggle=""yes"">GAA</italic> variants database <uri http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink href=""http://www.pompevariantdatabase.nl"">http://www.pompevariantdatabase.nl</uri>, (accessed on 26 April 2024) which was last updated in 2023, reports more than 911 disease-associated mutations [<xref rid=""B19-ijms-25-09139"" ref-type=""bibr"">19</xref>]. Currently, enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) with <italic toggle=""yes"">GAA</italic>-enzyme is the first and unique treatment available for PD, and was approved in 2006 [<xref rid=""B20-ijms-25-09139"" ref-type=""bibr"">20</xref>]. In order to achieve optimal results, ERT should be started before symptoms are evident: indeed, it is well established that early initiation of ERT in IOPD improves survival, reduces the need for mechanical ventilation, results in early independent ambulation and improves the patient’s overall quality of life [<xref rid=""B21-ijms-25-09139"" ref-type=""bibr"">21</xref>]. In 2014, during the 208th International Workshop of the European Neuromuscular Center, the European Pompe Consortium was formed, bringing together a group of experts from 11 different European countries, all with long experience in the treatment and follow-up of patients with PD, to outline recommendations for the initiation and discontinuation of ERT in adult patients [<xref rid=""B22-ijms-25-09139"" ref-type=""bibr"">22</xref>]. It was observed that patients receiving ERT present significant differences in their responses. These responses are heterogeneous and influenced by many factors, such as age at treatment initiation, cross-reactive immune material (CRIM) status, ACE genotype, sustained intermediate titers (SIT), muscle fiber type involvement, extent of pre-existing pathology, high and sustained antibody titers (HSAT), and ACTN genotype [<xref rid=""B23-ijms-25-09139"" ref-type=""bibr"">23</xref>]. Cross-reactive immunological material (CRIM) is a measurement of natural <italic toggle=""yes"">GAA</italic> production and an important factor influencing patients’ responses to ERT. In general, CRIM-positive subjects tolerate ERT well. However, CRIM-negative subjects and some classified as CRIM-positive have a low response to ERT due to complications from the immune response to the drug [<xref rid=""B23-ijms-25-09139"" ref-type=""bibr"">23</xref>,<xref rid=""B24-ijms-25-09139"" ref-type=""bibr"">24</xref>,<xref rid=""B25-ijms-25-09139"" ref-type=""bibr"">25</xref>]. To update the status of Italian subjects with both childhood onset (IOPD) and late onset (LOPD) in Italy, we present the results collected in recent years on samples that came to our attention. We evaluated the enzyme activity and genetic study of mutations in the <italic toggle=""yes"">GAA</italic> gene. We employed a fluorimetric test to evaluate alpha-glucosidase activity on blood spots in 2934 patients who presented with symptoms linked to PD, or for newborn screening. In the whole cohort of patients analyzed with reduced or borderline activity, genetic testing was done, and we found 39 patients with two causative mutations in <italic toggle=""yes"">GAA</italic> gene connected to PD, and 22 subjects with GVUS variants. These results not only underscore the critical importance of early and accurate diagnosis but also highlight the essential collaboration between clinicians and geneticists. The integration of enzyme activity screening and genetic testing represents a major advancement in our ability to identify and manage PD, ensuring patients receive timely and appropriate care. By presenting these data, we aim to emphasize the substantial progress made in the field of PD research and diagnosis in Italy, showcasing how interdisciplinary efforts are pivotal to advancing medical knowledge and patient outcomes. Our research indicates that Italian patients with Pompe disease present a diverse genetic landscape, with specific mutations in the <italic toggle=""yes"">GAA</italic> gene contributing to disease severity and progression. The variability in symptom onset, ranging from childhood to adulthood, underlines the complexity of genotype–phenotype correlations in this population. In addition, enzymatic and genetic testing over the years has allowed more precise diagnoses and management strategies tailored to the individual profiles of our patients. In conclusion, early diagnosis remains critical for optimizing outcomes in Pompe disease. In Italy, efforts to enhance awareness among healthcare providers have facilitated timely identification of symptoms such as muscle weakness, respiratory insufficiency, and cardiac involvement. Diagnostic modalities including enzyme assays, genetic testing, and imaging techniques play pivotal roles in confirming the disease and monitoring its progression. We evaluated the enzyme activity of 2934 subjects, 1670 males and 1264 females, divided by age. Mean age was 31 years at time of analysis: 165 subjects aged 0 to 1 years old suspected to have IOPD, and 2769 subjects over 1 year old suspected to have LOPD. The typical clinical features reported in Toscano et al. were found in all our examined subjects [<xref rid=""B49-ijms-25-09139"" ref-type=""bibr"">49</xref>]. Due to the importance of scientific health research to date, a study of subjects from different hospital departments was conducted to delineate the clinical phenomenon in an observational and analytical view. DBS received with suspected PD came from: 1380 neurology (47.03%), 40 metabolic diseases (1.36%), 473 pediatrics (16.12%), 116 pneumology (3.95%), 177 internal medicine (6.03%), 345 rheumatology (11.76%), 322 from other departments such as cardiology, anesthesia and reanimation, hematology, and medical genetics (10.97%), and 81 from unspecified departments (2.76%) (<xref rid=""ijms-25-09139-f002"" ref-type=""fig"">Figure 2</xref>). The first step was to assess the outcome of enzyme activity. Of the 2934 individuals studied by DBS, 2489 showed normal acid α-glucosidase activity (≥6 nmol/mL/h), 105 individuals had no or reduced activity of the enzyme (≤3 nmol/mL/h), and 340 had an enzyme activity between 3 and 6 nmol/mL/h. In subjects with enzyme activity <6 nmol/mL/h, we performed genetic analysis on 445 subjects to research and identify any change in allelic variants of the <italic toggle=""yes"">GAA</italic> gene. In 105 subjects with none or severely reduced enzyme activity, we identified 39 patients who had either homozygosity for one mutation, or compound heterozygosity for two mutations in the <italic toggle=""yes"">GAA</italic> gene, known in the literature to be responsible for PD. Segregation analysis in the patients’ family with Sanger sequencing confirmed that, in the 31 cases of compound heterozygote, mutations were on both homologous chromosomes. This confirmed the diagnosis of PD from a genetic point of view for all patients analyzed. In the remaining 51 of the 105 subjects were false positives in which the enzymatic analysis showed values below normal, but no causative mutations in the <italic toggle=""yes"">GAA</italic> gene were found in the genetic analysis. The remaining 15 out of the 105 subjects had a causative mutation in simple heterozygosity. Therefore, the reduced enzyme activity could be due to a leukopenia condition and/or improper storage/transport of the sample. The most common mutation reported in our analyzed samples was the pathogenic c.-32-13 T>G variant (homozygous or with a second pathogenic allele), located in intron 1 documented in the literature as a causative mutation of PD. All variants found in our molecular study associated with the c.-32-13 T>G mutation were reported in the bibliographies and public databases of PD mutations (Pompe variant database, clinvar). Specifically, 25 of 39 patients reported this causative mutation. Of these 25, 5 patients had the mutation in homozygosity and 20 patients in compound heterozygosity (<xref rid=""ijms-25-09139-t001"" ref-type=""table"">Table 1</xref>). In addition, the study was further investigated by conducting MLPA in patients who had only one mutation on Sanger sequencing analysis. The assay was performed in 149 subjects. This method revealed in four subjects the presence of exonic deletions in the <italic toggle=""yes"">GAA</italic> gene causative of PD in association with other causative point mutations. In detail, the deletions found in our patients were located in exon 9, exon 17, exon 18, and exon 19, respectively, in the first four cases. In the other four, three investigations were conducted for a family segregation study in which, in addition to the deletion, benign polymorphisms were found. One patient showed a deletion in exon 12. Four of these eight subjects had the deletion in association with other causative point mutations, as shown in <xref rid=""ijms-25-09139-t001"" ref-type=""table"">Table 1</xref>, and for the remaining four no additional mutations in the <italic toggle=""yes"">GAA</italic> gene were found. In our study, we identified a total of 39 subjects with PD, including 27 with two classic mutations in compound heterozygosity, 8 with mutations in homozygosity, and 4 with one causative mutation associated with a large deletion. Specifically, as shown in <xref rid=""ijms-25-09139-f003"" ref-type=""fig"">Figure 3</xref>, these subjects came from the following departments: 17 from neurology (43.6%), 4 from rheumatology (10.3%), 7 from pediatrics (17.9%), 3 from metabolic diseases (7.7%), and 8 from other departments (20.5%). Furthermore, our study identified five allelic variants in the sequence of the <italic toggle=""yes"">GAA</italic> gene (c.547-67C>G, c.547-39T>G, R437H, L641V, and L705P) that had not been previously described in the literature. In the entire cohort of patients analyzed with enzyme activity between 3 and 6 nmol/mL/h, we also detected 22 patients with variants of uncertain significance (GVUS) mutations in heterozygosity (<xref rid=""ijms-25-09139-f004"" ref-type=""fig"">Figure 4</xref>). In our study, we investigated all genetic polymorphisms as a possible factor contributing to PD. These were classified according to the type of genetic polymorphism investigated and whether the result favored or did not favor association with PD. As asserted by Ravaglia et al., genetic variations impacting muscle structure and metabolism could potentially influence the phenotype of metabolic myopathies [<xref rid=""B50-ijms-25-09139"" ref-type=""bibr"">50</xref>]. We found in our subjects frequently benign polymorphisms, as reported in databases of PD-associated mutations and annotated as benign variants, and which were thus unrelated to PD. These statistical results collected over a recent period geographically cover the entire Italian demographic area. Therefore, this clinical study plays an important role in knowing and being able to identify typical signs and symptoms of PD. The diagnosis of PD poses challenges due to its diverse clinical presentations among patients, the rarity of the condition, and the complexities involved in recognizing its symptoms. Consequently, it often remains underdiagnosed. This article aimed to highlight the increasing number of PD Italian cases identified through dried blood spot (DBS) testing in recent years. Additionally, this study incorporated the assessment of quantitative variations in the <italic toggle=""yes"">GAA</italic> gene using the multiple ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA) assay to enhance diagnostic accuracy. As discussed, for autosomal recessive diseases, the presence of two causative mutations in compound heterozygosity or homozygosity defines an individual with PD. To determine whether the two mutations are in cis or trans positions, a genetic investigation was conducted within the family to see how the mutations were transmitted in their chromosomes and thus inherited by the individual under study. The cis configuration occurs when two mutant alleles are on the same homologous chromosome, while the trans configuration occurs when the two mutant alleles are on different homologous chromosomes. Our study concluded that Italian patients exhibited a characteristic genetic profile similar to that of the broader European population, with the c.-32-13T>G variant being the most prevalent. Genetic analysis also indicated that the functional significance and potential interrelationships of numerous benign polymorphisms, as well as other genetic variants of uncertain significance (GVUS), are still relatively unknown. We can conclude that our results allow us to set the cutoff for enzyme activity at <3 nmol/mL/h for the identified cases of PD. For MLPA, large deletions make up only 1.5% of known variants, and the deletion of exon 18 was a common variant in Caucasian patients. A more systematic approach, as previously described in our study, could lead to the identification of new variants associated with PD and allow for a definitive diagnosis of patients. The implementation of MLPA should be considered to complete the genetic analysis of the most challenging cases, where there is a strong clinical suspicion supported by signs and symptoms associated with pathological enzyme activity values. Given the extensive heterogeneity of the <italic toggle=""yes"">GAA</italic> gene, both in enzymatic and genetic characteristic terms, additional efforts are required to investigate the potential influence of environmental and epigenetic factors on phenotype modulation. Furthermore, for improved patient classification, future studies should be conducted through close collaboration between neuropsychiatry divisions and genetic laboratories. In summary, prompt diagnosis is crucial for maximizing outcomes of Pompe disease. In Italy, initiatives to raise awareness among healthcare providers have facilitated timely recognition of symptoms such as muscle weakness, respiratory insufficiency, and cardiac involvement. Diagnostic methods such as enzyme assays, genetic testing, and imaging techniques are essential for confirming the disease and tracking its progression. This information could be useful for developing new biomarkers for this disease. The advent of enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) has revolutionized the management of Pompe disease, offering a targeted approach to supplementing deficient <italic toggle=""yes"">GAA</italic> enzyme activity. Italian patients have benefited from access to ERT, which aims to alleviate symptoms, improve muscle function, and enhance quality of life. Ongoing research explores novel therapeutic avenues, including gene therapy and pharmacological chaperones, to further optimize treatment outcomes and address challenges such as immune response and sustained efficacy. In conclusion, Pompe disease presents complex clinical and genetic landscapes among Italian patients, underscoring the importance of ongoing research and multidisciplinary collaboration in enhancing diagnostic accuracy, therapeutic efficacy, and overall patient outcomes. Continued efforts are essential to improve disease-management strategies, expand treatment options, and ultimately improve the lives of individuals living with Pompe disease, both in Italy and globally.  To satisfy the ongoing need for knowledge and to promote research, a study was conducted in our laboratories to describe biochemical findings and the mutation spectrum of the <italic toggle=""yes"">GAA</italic> gene for PD patients. Although this metabolic disorder is caused by a unique enzyme deficiency, it appears with a wide range of clinical phenotypes and with considerable variability in progression speed, degree of organ involvement, and disease severity. This is related to the number of known pathogenic mutations, their kind (nonsense, missense, framesahift), and their mutual interaction with the rest of the genome [<xref rid=""B52-ijms-25-09139"" ref-type=""bibr"">52</xref>,<xref rid=""B53-ijms-25-09139"" ref-type=""bibr"">53</xref>,<xref rid=""B54-ijms-25-09139"" ref-type=""bibr"">54</xref>,<xref rid=""B55-ijms-25-09139"" ref-type=""bibr"">55</xref>,<xref rid=""B56-ijms-25-09139"" ref-type=""bibr"">56</xref>,<xref rid=""B57-ijms-25-09139"" ref-type=""bibr"">57</xref>]. This report presents a study of Italian subjects with PD, highlighting the importance of knowledge of the disease so that the clinician can recognize it and request enzyme and genetic counselling to avoid misdiagnosis. This report presents a work on Pompe disease, highlighting the importance of genetic counseling and enzyme testing to avoid misdiagnosis. Diagnostic delay or misdiagnosis in a patient with PD signs and symptoms are the most critical points in determining the evolution of the patient’s clinical and therapeutic history. The right strategic approach is the most effective solution to improve the course of the disease and patient’s outcome. In addition, the possibility of extending the genetic study to family members of identified affected probands promotes not only early diagnosis but also timely therapeutic intervention.",N/A,23 8 2024

MetabERN is a non-profit European Reference Network for Metabolic Diseases consisting of 97 nationally certified centers from 27 European Union (EU) Member States. The network was established by the EU in 2016 to facilitate access to the best available care in the Union and to address the needs of patients affected by inherited metabolic diseases. MetabERN covers different activities, divided into work packages, including the development of recommendations for the diagnosis and management of metabolic diseases. The Pompe disease CPR document developed by the working group was intended to be a concise and easy-to-use tool for standardization of care for patients among the healthcare providers that are members of the network. The document was based on quality assessment and transparent procedures. The approach used to produce this document was based on literature survey, selection of articles that were deemed valuable and essential for Pompe disease care, quality assessment of the literature, and incorporation of information in a template provided by MetabERN. In this article the document developed by the working group includes minor adaptations and adjustments according by the Journal’s editorial requirements. For the development of CPRs a platform was set up on Google Drive and template matrices were made available by the general coordinators of the MetabERN guideline work package. A working group was selected on a voluntary basis among members of the lysosomal storage disease subnetwork (LSD-SNW). The group was composed by experts from several European countries with specific expertise in the care of Pompe disease, including metabolic physicians, pediatricians, neurologists, child neurologists, endocrinologist, cardiologists, pneumologists, and by patient support group representatives. The work was conducted, according to the workflow indicated by the CPRs platform (Fig. <xref rid=""Fig1"" ref-type=""fig"">1</xref>), exploiting online resources for exchange of informative materials and correspondence, with periodic reports on advancements and discussions at MetabERN general board conventions or at MetabERN LSD-SNW meetings.<fig id=""Fig1""><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>The working strategy for the development of CPRs for Pompe disease.

Significance of early diagnosis and treatment of adult late-onset Pompe disease on the effectiveness of enzyme replacement therapy in improving muscle strength and respiratory function: a case report,,"Glycogen storage disease II, or Pompe disease (MIM 232300), is an autosomal recessive disorder caused by mutations in the GAA gene (MIM 606800), which encodes acid α-1,4-glucosidase, a lysosomal enzyme involved in the degradation of glycogen that results in glycogen storage, mainly in skeletal muscles but even in several other organs such as the central nervous system (CNS), heart, respiratory system, vessels, and so on. [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR1"">1</xref>]. This degenerative process is sustained by the enlargement and rupture of glycogen-filled lysosomes; however, impaired autophagic flux is also present. The accumulation of glycogen results in cellular dysfunction and cell damage due to hypertrophy and lysosomal ruptures; additional factors such as impaired autophagy, disrupted lysosome signaling pathways, oxidative stress, and abnormal mitochondria also contribute to Pompe disease, causing alterations in muscle structure with the displacement of myofibrils [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR2"">2</xref>–<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR4"">4</xref>]. Two major distinctive clinical phenotypes are recognized on the basis of the age at which the symptoms appear and the presence or absence of cardiomyopathy: the most severe classic infantile-onset type (IOPD) includes patients with less than 1% of GAA activity who develop symptoms within the first year of life and, if left untreated, rarely survive beyond 18 months, and the milder late-onset type (LOPD) with higher enzyme activity that may become apparent in childhood, adolescence, or adulthood [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR5"">5</xref>, <xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR6"">6</xref>]. As skeletal and respiratory muscle weakness progress, patients often require ambulatory and ventilation assistance. Respiratory failure is therefore a cause of significant morbidity and the most frequent cause of death. Alglucosidase alfa (Lumizyme<sup>®</sup>/Myozyme<sup>®</sup>, Sanofi Genzyme, Cambridge, MA, USA) is an enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) used for the treatment of Pompe disease that provides patients with exogenous recombinant human GAA [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR7"">7</xref>]. Alglucosidase alpha is a 110 kDa precursor protein that contains a mannose-6-phosphate group (M6P), allowing cells to import the enzyme via the M6P receptor (M6PR) and transport the compound to lysosomes [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR8"">8</xref>]. Pompe disease presents as a continuum of disease severity across numerous individual myocytes. Some myocytes already exhibit irreversible changes, such as the accumulation of autophagic debris and extralysosomal glycogen in stage 4 cells, before clinical signs appear. Therefore, early initiation of ERT is important in late-onset Pompe disease [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR9"">9</xref>]. In this report, we describe the case of a 38-year-old Iranian Baloch woman with progressive muscle weakness for over 20 years who had been on a ventilator for approximately 12 years and had been undergoing ERT with a diagnosis of LOPD. Unfortunately, significant improvements in muscle function, especially respiratory muscles, have not been observed due to the late start of treatment. This was a 48-month observational study of a previously untreated patient with LOPD, followed from 2019 to 2022 in Iran, whose diagnosis and treatment were planned by our team. The initial evaluation was performed for 6 months. Disease screening was performed by measuring the activity of GAA in dried blood spots (DBS) using lysosomal enzyme testing at pH 3.8 with and without specific inhibition that was below their respective reference ranges. The diagnosis of Pompe disease was confirmed by DNA extraction from DBS, PCR amplification, and sequencing of all coding exons and flanking intronic regions in which two mutations were detected. The respiratory system was evaluated using chest computed tomography (CT) between 2019 and 2022 before and after ERT. The patient was a bedridden, ventilator-dependent 38-year-old Iranian Baloch woman presenting with weakness in the limb-girdle and pelvic muscles and respiratory failure. The patient had eight brothers and two sisters, two of whom had passed away with a history of unknown muscle weakness throughout their lives, with no respiratory problems. The patient’s muscle weakness was such that she could only raise her arms against gravity (3/5) and move her feet horizontally with gravity eliminated (2/5) in the limb force test. The patient was unable to perform any additional movements, and we could not conduct a spirometry test due to ventilator dependency. The electromyography (EMG) and nerve conduction velocity (NCV) tests were also performed, but the detailed results are not accessible, although a myopathic pattern was reported. The results of other examinations were completely normal. The patient tolerated the ventilator and did not show dyspnea or cyanosis of the face, lips, or distal limbs. Her symptoms began with fatigue and limb weakness when she was 16 years of age. She got married at 19 years old and at the same age, conceived a child which led to a spontaneous abortion. After the abortion, she consulted a neurologist for muscle weakness and received prescriptions for EMG and NCV studies, as well as a muscle biopsy, with the results pending. The patient had undergone corticosteroid therapy when she was 20 years old because of a possible diagnosis of inflammatory myopathy for one year, which did not result in any improvements. At 21, the patient undergoes 1 year of pharmacotherapy with corticosteroids and azathioprine, with no change in her condition. At the age of 23 years, the patient conceives another child with no problems during the prenatal period. Afterward, the patient’s respiratory status worsened, and she moved into the city in which our health center was located to follow up on her condition. The patient visited the hospital with chief complaints of respiratory symptoms, such as dyspnea and muscle weakness, such that she could no longer get up or walk without assistance. She was admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) and later on, the wards, for 1.5 years. The patient then spends another 6 months in the ward, during which no definite diagnosis is made. She was ultimately discharged on her ventilator since there were no additional problems. Unfortunately, owing to the deletion of the patient’s medical records, no information regarding the clinical course, diagnostic approaches, and treatment regimens is available. After discharge, the patient spent 12 years at home, was bedridden, and ventilator-dependent, during which she had only had a few visits to the hospital due to issues related to her ventilator, and the condition of the patient remained unchanged. Later, the patient was referred to us, and after primary investigations, with suspicion of Pompe disease, we performed a dried blood spot test for Pompe disease, in which reduced activity of α-glucosidase enzyme was reported. Finally, to confirm our diagnosis, genetic testing was conducted where two homozygous mutations, namely c.[1555A > G];[1555A > G] and p.[Met519Val];[Met519Val] were reported, which confirmed the diagnosis of Pompe disease at the age of 36. Treatment with myozyme (20 mg/kg every 2 weeks) was initiated and continued for 2 years. After 2 years, no progressive clinical course was observed, nor was there any improvement, except for the patient’s reported easier breathing. The patient was bedridden and ventilator-dependent and the muscular force of the upper limbs was (4/5) and is (3/5) of the lower limbs. Figure <xref rid=""Fig1"" ref-type=""fig"">1</xref> shows the patient's chest CT scan in two stages: (1) before and (2) 2 years after ERT initiation, which showed consolidation and mild pleural effusion at the bases of both lungs. Due to the lack of respiratory symptoms such as cough, dyspnea, phlegm discharge, and fever, and the fact that the patient has been bedridden for a long time, it can be said that this chest CT pattern is due to repeated aspirations. CT scans were performed during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic.<fig id=""Fig1""><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>The patient’s chest CT scan is shown in two stages. <bold>A</bold> and <bold>B</bold> before and (<bold>C</bold> and <bold>D</bold>) 2 years after enzyme replacement therapy (ERT), which shows consolidation (red arrows) and mild pleural effusion (yellow arrows) at the bases of both lungs</p></caption><graphic http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink href=""13256_2024_4837_Fig1_HTML"" id=""MO1""></graphic></fig> A timeline summarizing the history of disease and therapeutic interventions related to patients with LOPD is presented in Fig. <xref rid=""Fig2"" ref-type=""fig"">2</xref>.<fig id=""Fig2""><label>Fig. 2</label><caption><p>A timeline of historical events and therapeutic interventions for the patient with LOPD</p></caption><graphic http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink href=""13256_2024_4837_Fig2_HTML"" id=""MO2""></graphic></fig> In our study, the detection of two homozygous mutations c.[1555A > G] and p.[Met519Val] confirmed Pompe disease. Interestingly, other family members of the presented case were later diagnosed with Pompe disease, as confirmed by enzyme testing of alpha-1,4 Glucosidase and the following heterozygous variants: c.[631G > A];[1594G > A], (p.[Val211Met];[Gly532Ser]) and c.631G > A (p.Val211Met), c.1555A > G (p.Met519Val). Identification of heterozygous variants among family members highlights the autosomal recessive inheritance pattern of the disease; both parents must contribute a mutated allele for offspring to manifest the disorder. Progressive proximal weakness exhibited a limb-girdling distribution, particularly in hip flexors. The respiratory muscles and diaphragm are involved early, but late-onset GAA deficiency may be present in those aged up to 60 years (even within the same family). Late-onset Pompe disease (LOPD) may be diagnosed in individuals > 12 months of age or in younger patients (who, however, do not exhibit clinically apparent cardiac involvement). Chronic respiratory insufficiency is a major clinical problem in patients with LOPD. The definitive etiology remains unclear; however, the intercostal muscle, diaphragm, and motor neuron pathology play a role. Patients with LOPD often require respiratory support, either inspiratory/expiratory training or non-invasive ventilation, continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP), and bilevel positive airway pressure (BiPAP) to treat hypoxemia at night and hypercapnia during the day. Some patients require tracheostomies and mechanical ventilation. Respiratory insufficiency may occur early in the course of LOPD in patients with progressive myopathy and muscle weakness accompanied by diaphragmatic involvement. It is difficult to predict the dynamics of respiratory decline. Male sex, the extent of skeletal muscle involvement, and disease duration are known risk factors for the development of severe respiratory insufficiency. A significant link between disease severity and disease duration (rather than age per se) was evident: the risk of progression to respiratory support increased by 8% every year since diagnosis. Importantly, no genotype–phenotype correlations have been described. The available data are few, but encouraging. Patients with LOPD commonly benefit from ERT, exhibiting improvements in muscular and/or respiratory function (66% of patients treated with alglucosidase alfa) [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR10"">10</xref>]. Diagnosis of LOPD is still challenging and often delayed for several reasons, such as rarity, wide clinical spectrum, overlap of signs and symptoms with other neuromuscular disorders, or variable diagnostic approaches in different countries. Since 2006, specific treatment with ERT has become available, making early diagnosis crucial for limiting disease progression [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR11"">11</xref>, <xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR12"">12</xref>]. Two main options to support breathing in these patients are noninvasive mechanical ventilation (NIV) and assisted cough. Replacement therapy with alglucosidase alfa (Myozyme<sup>®</sup>, Genzyme), a recombinant lysosomal glycogen-cleaving enzyme, is currently the only specific pharmacological approach for LOPD. Treatment with alglucosidase alfa resulted in a mortality rate nearly five-fold lower than that of the untreated patients. Replacement therapy was associated with a reduction in forced vital capacity (FVC) decline, improvement in the 6-minute walk test, and ambulation within the first few months. These data confirm that the early initiation of ERT yields the best outcomes [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR13"">13</xref>]. Pompe disease primarily affects muscle tissue. As the disease advances, the muscle tissue becomes atrophic and is gradually replaced by fatty tissue [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR14"">14</xref>]. Individual variation in the effects of treatment has been well-documented in numerous studies [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR15"">15</xref>]. It has been suggested that early initiation of treatment can be beneficial, particularly for more severely affected patients who may have experienced a higher degree of muscle damage and loss of functional abilities [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR16"">16</xref>]. In 2020, Stockton <italic toggle=""yes"">et al</italic>. conducted a study aimed at investigating the effects of the time from diagnosis to treatment on 369 patients with LOPD. Their findings revealed that early initiation of ERT with alglucosidase alfa post-diagnosis positively impacted maintaining forced vital capacity (FVC) at a higher level. Conversely, the study suggested that delaying the commencement of ERT in symptomatic patients might lead to less effective preservation of respiratory function over time [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR17"">17</xref>]. In 2020, Semplicini <italic toggle=""yes"">et al</italic>. conducted a prospective analytical study to assess the long-term benefits of ERT with alglucosidase alfa in adults with Pompe disease. The study found that there was no observed stabilization or improvement in forced vital capacity (FVC) during the initial years of treatment, aligning with findings from a Dutch 5-year prospective study [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR18"">18</xref>]. Additionally, in 2016, Boentert <italic toggle=""yes"">et al</italic>. conducted a systematic review to provide practical recommendations for diagnosing and managing respiratory muscle weakness in LOPD. These findings highlight the importance of early initiation of appropriate treatment and strongly recommend linking patients to specialized centers [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR19"">19</xref>]. In a recent study, the effectiveness of ERT in treating advanced LOPD was examined in a 57-year-old woman who had been experiencing symptoms for 30 years and had initially been misdiagnosed. This patient, who was reliant on NIV and confined to a wheelchair, was admitted for acute respiratory failure. Following 5 years of ERT treatment, she experienced significant improvements, being able to walk longer distances with the assistance of a cane or walker and only requiring NIV at night. The findings of this study suggest that ERT should be considered as a feasible treatment option for individuals with advanced LOPD [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR20"">20</xref>]. It is important to recognize that even patients who may initially appear unresponsive to therapy can show improvement with ERT. This improvement can be particularly significant when considering the limitations of ERT, especially in advanced stages of disease. One limitation of ERT in advanced stages is the short duration of action, which can compromise its efficacy. Patients often require frequent hospital infusions every other week to maintain therapeutic enzyme levels. Additionally, as the disease progresses, it becomes harder to deliver enough enzymes to muscle tissues, reducing the desired therapeutic effect. Another challenge is the precise targeting of enzymes to lysosomes, as this can impact treatment outcomes. Moreover, ERT may not address all associated biochemical disruptions, such as autophagic buildup, which can persist despite treatment. Some patients may also develop an immune response to the administered enzyme, leading to a loss of efficacy or even anaphylactic reactions [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR16"">16</xref>, <xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR20"">20</xref>]. Understanding these limitations is crucial for making informed clinical decisions and underscores the need for complementary therapeutic approaches in managing advanced disease stages. By acknowledging these challenges, healthcare providers can better tailor treatment plans to optimize patient outcomes. The absence of symptoms such as dyspnea, cyanosis, or sleep disturbance in our ventilated patient suggests that only the muscular aspect of the respiratory system was impacted. Due to the substantial time lapse between symptom onset and the initiation of ERT, coupled with the lack of respiratory improvement over 2 years, except for marginal breathing ease, it is evident that irreversible histopathologic changes had affected the patient's respiratory muscles. Consequently, ERT did not alleviate their respiratory failure. This highlights the crucial significance of early LOPD diagnosis and prompt treatment to prevent significant muscle damage and improve the effectiveness of ERT on respiratory muscle functions. As new treatment alternatives surface, it is essential to carry out further research in extensive studies to discover more efficient management and treatment choices for Pompe disease. The current study was limited by the inability to determine the best timing for starting ERT when symptoms first appear to achieve maximum effectiveness. The pulmonary function tests could not be conducted due to the patient's ventilator dependency. Further research with a larger sample size is needed. Moreover, the lack of a clear consensus in the literature on the ideal stage of LOPD progression for diagnosis and the most efficient time to start treatment, as well as the definition of a delayed diagnosis, complicates the categorization of other relevant studies. As a result, a more thorough understanding of the optimal timing for initiating ERT remains elusive.",N/A,8 10 2024
Pombiliti and Opfolda: shaping the future of adult late-onset pompe disease: an editorial,,"Pompe disease, also called glycogenosis type II or acid maltase deficiency, is an uncommon and persistent neuromuscular disorder characterized by the progressive weakening of skeletal and cardiac muscles<sup><xref rid=""R1"" ref-type=""bibr"">1</xref></sup>. While estimates of the disease’s incidence vary from 1:40 000 to 60 000 individuals, the reported incidence differs across populations<sup><xref rid=""R2"" ref-type=""bibr"">2</xref></sup>. This article focuses on POMBILITI (cipaglucosidase alfa) + OPFOLDA (miglustat), an FDA-approved dual-component therapy. It thoroughly examines the treatment’s pharmacokinetics, recommended dosage, mode of action, and the prospective advantages it may offer in addressing late-onset Pompe disease in adults. The objective is to provide valuable insights into this therapeutic approach, enhancing comprehension of its potential benefits for individuals grappling with the condition. Pompe disease (PD) is an autosomal recessive condition arising from mutations in the acid alpha-glucosidase gene (GAA) located on chromosome 17, encoding the lysosomal GAA enzyme, which is responsible for the conversion of glycogen into glucose, a critical energy source for muscle function. This enzyme deficiency, whether partial or total, leads to an abnormal buildup of glycogen, serving as the underlying cause of Pompe’s disease<sup><xref rid=""R1"" ref-type=""bibr"">1</xref></sup>. This mechanism by which glycogen builds up is shown in Fig. <xref rid=""F1"" ref-type=""fig"">1</xref>. Glycogen is an intracellular polymer consisting of glucose residues joined in linear chains by α 1→4 bonds and branches joined at branch sites by α 1→6 bonds<sup><xref rid=""R3"" ref-type=""bibr"">3</xref></sup>. Glycogen accumulation occurs in lysosomes across various tissues, with skeletal and cardiac muscles primarily affected, resulting in clinical symptoms. The condition manifests with diverse signs, ranging from hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and hypotonia in infancy to a gradual skeletal muscle myopathy in adults. Muscle structure and strength decline due to progressive lysosomal enlargement, rupture, cytoplasmic glycogen accumulation, and myofibril displacement. Recent research underscores multiple pathogenic mechanisms, including autophagy, oxidative stress, mitochondrial abnormalities, and calcium homeostasis, contributing to tissue damage in Pompe disease and similar lysosomal storage disorders. Non-contractile substances, such as glycogen-filled lysosomes, cytoplasmic glycogen pools, autophagic remnants, and lipofuscin, disrupt the contractile machinery, ultimately causing muscle injury and reduced performance<sup><xref rid=""R1"" ref-type=""bibr"">1</xref></sup>. Although this condition manifests as a single disease continuum, two distinct phenotypes are widely accepted. The early onset, the infantile form, is marked by a profound or near complete deficiency of GAA. Symptoms emerge within the initial months of life, presenting as feeding difficulties, poor weight gain, dyspnea, muscle weakness, an enlarged heart, floppiness, and head lag. In the absence of prompt and appropriate treatment, many infants affected by this form do not survive beyond their first year, succumbing to cardiac or respiratory complications. Conversely, the late onset, often called the juvenile or adult form, results from a partial deficiency of GAA. This form primarily affects skeletal muscles and progresses over several years, ultimately leading to death due to respiratory failure. In this phenotype, the heart is typically not affected<sup><xref rid=""R4"" ref-type=""bibr"">4</xref></sup>.  POMBILITI + OPFOLDA, a dual-component therapy, represents a significant breakthrough in treating late-onset Pompe disease for adults who have not experienced improvements from existing treatments. This therapy pairs POMBILITI, a rhGAA enriched with bis-M6P that improves cellular uptake while preserving enzymatic function, with OPFOLDA. POMBILITI possesses the same amino acid sequence as the natural GAA enzyme but features complex-type N-glycan structures with two M6P moieties on the same glycan. These M6P moieties facilitate binding to M6P receptors on the cell surface. OPFOLDA, coadministered with POMBILITI, is a synthetic analog of D-glucose and the active ingredient in Zavesca, approved for treating adult patients with mild to moderate Type 1 Gaucher disease when ERT is not viable. OPFOLDA binds to, stabilizes, and prevents the inactivation of POMBILITI in the bloodstream after infusion<sup><xref rid=""R12"" ref-type=""bibr"">12</xref></sup>. As a result, this oral enzyme stabilizer minimizes enzyme activity loss in the bloodstream. After cellular uptake, POMBILITI is transferred to lysosomes, where it replaces the deficient or defective lysosomal GAA enzyme and breaks down accumulated glycogen, thereby preventing the sequelae associated with lysosomal glycogen buildup, accounting for the clinical presentation of Pompe disease. Conversely, OPFOLDA does not undergo cellular uptake and remains in the bloodstream<sup><xref rid=""R1"" ref-type=""bibr"">1</xref>,<xref rid=""R13"" ref-type=""bibr"">13</xref></sup>. By preventing the breakdown of POMBILITI before its uptake by cells, it effectively maintains serum levels of POMBILITI with a relatively much lower dose than previously available treatment options<sup><xref rid=""R14"" ref-type=""bibr"">14</xref></sup>. (Fig. <xref rid=""F3"" ref-type=""fig"">3</xref>). The FDA’s approval for Pombiliti in conjunction with Opfolda is based on findings from Trial 1/NCT03729362, involving 123 late-onset Pompe disease (LOPD) patients aged 18 and above across 61 sites in 24 countries, including the U.S. Patients were randomly assigned to receive Opfolda with Pombiliti or a placebo alongside a non-U.S.-approved alglucosidase alfa product biweekly for 52 weeks. Most patients had prior alglucosidase alfa treatment (ERT-experienced), while some were treatment-naïve. Those receiving Opfolda and Pombiliti demonstrated more favorable changes in sitting forced vital capacity (FVC) and 6-min walk distance (6MWD) compared to the placebo group. Specifically, they showed increased sitting FVC and improved 6MWD at Week 52. ERT-experienced patients also experienced positive changes in these parameters with Opfolda and Pombiliti. This research underscores the potential benefits of this treatment combination for eligible LOPD patients, representing a significant advancement in their treatment options<sup><xref rid=""R15"" ref-type=""bibr"">15</xref>–<xref rid=""R18"" ref-type=""bibr"">18</xref></sup>. (Table <xref rid=""T2"" ref-type=""table"">2</xref>). OPFOLDA (cipaglucosidase alfa-atga) and POMBILITI (miglustat) are vital components of a treatment plan. It is imperative to administer OPFOLDA alongside POMBILITI, commencing this combined therapy two weeks after the last ERT dose. For OPFOLDA, a 65 mg capsule should be taken ~1 h before the intravenous infusion of POMBILITI. It is crucial to refrain from consuming other food or drinks for at least two hours before and after taking OPFOLDA. The POMBILITI infusion should be initiated about an hour after OPFOLDA ingestion. The recommended dosage for POMBILITI is 20 mg per kilogram of body weight, given via a 4-h intravenous infusion every other week. Maintaining this precise treatment schedule is essential for its effectiveness<sup><xref rid=""R18"" ref-type=""bibr"">18</xref></sup>. An analysis was conducted on the safety of POMBILITI and OPFOLDA treatment in 151 adult patients with LOPD across three clinical trials. These trials included 85 participants in a randomized, double-blind, active-controlled trial (Trial 1), 37 individuals in an open-label extension study that transitioned from a non-U.S.-approved alglucosidase alfa product to POMBILITI with OPFOLDA, and 29 subjects in an open-label trial. Trial 1 evaluated the benefits and side effects of POMBILITI in combination with Opfolda, and all three trials assessed the side effects of POMBILITI in combination with Opfolda<sup><xref rid=""R16"" ref-type=""bibr"">16</xref>,<xref rid=""R18"" ref-type=""bibr"">18</xref></sup>. The analysis unveiled those severe adverse reactions, including anaphylaxis and urticaria, observed in two or more patients who received POMBILITI with OPFOLDA. Furthermore, five patients discontinued POMBILITI treatment due to adverse reactions, with four ceasing the therapy due to severe adverse reactions. The most prevalent adverse reactions (occurring in at least 5% of patients) within this combined patient group were headache, diarrhea, fatigue, nausea, abdominal pain, and pyrexia<sup><xref rid=""R16"" ref-type=""bibr"">16</xref>,<xref rid=""R18"" ref-type=""bibr"">18</xref></sup>. Significantly, 32% of patients in these trials experienced infusion-associated reactions (IARs) during their treatment with POMBILITI combined with OPFOLDA. These reported IARs encompassed a variety of symptoms, including headache, myalgia, diarrhea, nausea, fatigue, muscle spasms, pyrexia, dizziness, cough, chills, rash, vomiting, dyspnea, pain, abdominal distension, tachycardia, urticaria, flatulence, pruritus, abdominal pain, chest discomfort, flushing, hyperhidrosis, dysgeusia, and hypertension. These findings offer valuable insights into the safety profile of POMBILITI in conjunction with OPFOLDA for individuals with LOPD<sup><xref rid=""R16"" ref-type=""bibr"">16</xref>,<xref rid=""R18"" ref-type=""bibr"">18</xref></sup>. Fig. <xref rid=""F4"" ref-type=""fig"">4</xref> compares the effectiveness and safety of Pombiliti + Opfolda versus Standard Enzyme Replacement Therapies (ERTs) for Pompe Disease. It highlights that Pombiliti + Opfolda offers positive trends, a safety advantage, and a lower dosage, whereas standard ERTs show plateaued improvement, safety warnings, and require higher dosages. Late-onset Pompe disease, an uncommon yet severe lysosomal disorder, poses significant challenges with its characteristic symptoms, including skeletal muscle weakness and progressive respiratory complications. Despite strides in medical research, the Pompe community continues to grapple with limited treatment choices, leaving unmet needs prevalent. The recent FDA approval of Pombiliti and Opfolda underscores the remarkable synergy of scientific innovation and our unwavering dedication to enhancing the lives of Pompe disease patients. For those affected by late-onset Pompe disease, the approval of Pombiliti and Opfolda signifies a long-awaited turning point, offering hope and advocacy for expanded therapeutic options. Clinical investigations have revealed promising advancements in musculoskeletal strength and respiratory function with the combination administration of Pombiliti and Opfolda. This breakthrough opens new doors for treatment and propels us towards a future where the challenges posed by Pompe disease can be more effectively addressed<sup><xref rid=""R19"" ref-type=""bibr"">19</xref></sup>. Nevertheless, it’s imperative to recognize the comprehensive safety profile of this treatment, which includes a Boxed Warning underscoring potential risks such as embryo-fetal toxicity, infertility, lactation, hypersensitivity reactions (including anaphylaxis), and infusion-associated reactions (IARs). It’s important to note that the combination of OPFOLDA and POMBILITI is not recommended during pregnancy. Given these safety considerations, healthcare professionals and patients should exercise caution and diligence when employing this therapy to address late-onset Pompe disease (LOPD)<sup><xref rid=""R16"" ref-type=""bibr"">16</xref>,<xref rid=""R18"" ref-type=""bibr"">18</xref></sup>. To enhance the treatment of late-onset Pompe disease (LOPD) with Pombiliti and Opfolda, several strategies can be implemented. For optimal dosing, Pombiliti should be administered intravenously at 20 mg/kg every other week, about an hour after taking Opfolda orally, with specific timing adjustments if a dose is missed. Combining this regimen with antihistamines, antipyretics, and corticosteroids can help reduce hypersensitivity reactions. Clinical trials have shown that this combination improves patient mobility, potentially lowering long-term healthcare costs and enhancing quality of life. Ensuring drug accessibility through ongoing research, clinical trials, and monitoring of adverse reactions in diverse populations is crucial. Additionally, tracking antidrug and neutralizing antibodies will help assess the long-term safety and efficacy of the treatment. These measures aim to maximize the benefits and accessibility of Pombiliti and Opfolda for LOPD patients. In summary, enzyme replacement therapies are the primary method for treating Pompe disease. However, studies have shown that over a long period, patients’ conditions often stabilize and then deteriorate, necessitating progressively higher doses of standard ERTs or the consideration of new therapeutic options. The approval of the first two-component therapy, comprising POMBILITI plus OPFOLDA, brings fresh hope for individuals with LOPD who have reached a plateau or show a decline in health condition with existing treatment. Clinical studies have demonstrated noteworthy enhancements in musculoskeletal and respiratory parameters when utilizing POMBILITI and OPFOLDA. Nevertheless, further research is required to assess its long-term outcomes, primarily to determine whether patient outcomes still improve after the initial few years of beginning the treatment. While the approval of this first dual-component therapy marks a significant milestone in Pompe disease management, ongoing research is essential to develop more effective combinations with improved therapeutic efficacy and tolerance to enhance patients’ quality of life with Pomp disease. Furthermore, clinical trials like the PROPEL trial should be conducted to assess the short-term and long-term effects of this therapy on IOPD patients, as they face even more significant management challenges. No patient was involved in this type of study, therefore no ethical approval was required. The study is an editorial and was not done on patients or volunteers, therefore no written consent was required. Not applicable. Conceptualization and project administration: A.S. and R.R.

Comparing the efficacy of cipaglucosidase alfa plus miglustat with other enzyme replacement therapies for late-onset Pompe disease: a network meta-analysis utilizing patient-level and aggregate data,,"Pompe disease is a rare disorder caused by a lack or deficiency of the enzyme acid α-glucosidase that hydrolyzes lysosomal glycogen [<xref rid=""B1"" ref-type=""bibr"">1</xref>]. It is characterized by progressive loss of muscular and respiratory function [<xref rid=""B2"" ref-type=""bibr"">2</xref>]. Two forms of Pompe disease exist: fast-progressing infantile-onset Pompe disease, which presents in the first months of life and is often fatal within 1 year of age without treatment, and late-onset Pompe disease (LOPD), which is progressive and can present at variable ages [<xref rid=""B1"" ref-type=""bibr"">1</xref>,<xref rid=""B3"" ref-type=""bibr"">3</xref>]. The combined frequency of infantile- and late-onset Pompe disease is estimated as 1 in 23,000 [<xref rid=""B4"" ref-type=""bibr"">4</xref>]. Pharmacologic treatment for Pompe disease consists of enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) to slow disease progression. ERT with recombinant human acid α-glucosidase (rhGAA) alglucosidase alfa (alglu) was the first approved treatment of LOPD [<xref rid=""B5"" ref-type=""bibr"">5</xref>]. Recently, advances have been made with the approvals of second-generation ERTs using rhGAA, such as avalglucosidase alfa (aval) [<xref rid=""B6"" ref-type=""bibr"">6</xref>,<xref rid=""B7"" ref-type=""bibr"">7</xref>] and cipaglucosidase alfa in combination with the small molecule stabilizer miglustat (cipa+mig) [<xref rid=""B8"" ref-type=""bibr"">8–12</xref>]. No head-to-head trials are currently available comparing aval with cipa+mig in patients with LOPD. Instead, the two novel ERTs have been studied in two pivotal, phase III randomized controlled trials (RCTs): the COMET trial comparing aval (n = 51) with alglu (n = 49) in ERT-naive patients [<xref rid=""B13"" ref-type=""bibr"">13</xref>], and the PROPEL trial comparing cipa+mig (n = 85) with alglu (n = 38) in primarily ERT-experienced patients with a smaller cohort of ERT-naive patients (77% ERT experienced, 23% ERT naive). Therefore, an indirect treatment comparison (ITC) is required to obtain estimates on their relative effect. This comparison may help us to better understand whether eligible patients with LOPD may benefit from one or another treatment, and potentially inform health technology assessment, cost effectiveness and reimbursement decisions. A standard network meta-analysis (NMA) collects aggregate data from multiple studies on multiple treatments in order to produce consistent estimates of relative treatment effects between each pair of treatments in the network [<xref rid=""B14"" ref-type=""bibr"">14</xref>,<xref rid=""B15"" ref-type=""bibr"">15</xref>]. It combines direct evidence (from head-to-head RCTs) and indirect evidence (via a common comparator) in a coherent manner from studies that form a connected network of treatment comparisons. Patient populations included in the RCTs forming a network can differ with respect to prognostic factors (i.e., factors that have an influence on the prognosis of the disease or condition) or with respect to effect modifiers (i.e., factors that lead to a differential effect of the intervention). While differences in prognostic factors across the RCTs included in the network should not impact the NMA results due to randomization and control, an imbalance of effect modifiers can lead to biased results [<xref rid=""B16"" ref-type=""bibr"">16</xref>]. Data from PROPEL and other clinical studies (e.g., ATB200-02 [<xref rid=""B17"" ref-type=""bibr"">17</xref>], NEO-1/-EXT [<xref rid=""B18"" ref-type=""bibr"">18</xref>]) suggest previous ERT treatment is a treatment effect modifier. Thus, a standard NMA might not be suitable to study the indirect treatment effect of cipa+mig versus aval, since the two RCTs (PROPEL and COMET) forming the network via the common comparator alglu differ with respect to previous treatment of the respective study populations at baseline. Anchored population-adjustment indirect comparison methods such as matching-adjusted indirect comparison [<xref rid=""B16"" ref-type=""bibr"">16</xref>,<xref rid=""B19"" ref-type=""bibr"">19</xref>] or simulated treatment comparison (STC) [<xref rid=""B16"" ref-type=""bibr"">16</xref>,<xref rid=""B20"" ref-type=""bibr"">20</xref>] would allow a comparison to be made between cipa+mig and aval in similar populations, but since the COMET trial included only ERT-naive patients, results would be similar to an NMA of COMET and the ERT-naive subgroup from PROPEL. Single-arm studies, which are common in rare diseases, can contribute valuable evidence on the effect of treatment in the trial population included. Unanchored matching-adjusted indirect comparison or unanchored STC (i.e., not linked via a common comparator) can be performed to derive relative effects adjusted to the comparator trial population, but they are applicable only to the simple pairwise scenario. Another population-adjustment indirect comparison method, multi-level network meta-regression (ML-NMR) [<xref rid=""B21"" ref-type=""bibr"">21</xref>], can provide relative effect estimates for any target population of interest, accounting for various treatment effect modifiers such as a mix of ERT-naive and ERT-experienced patients with LOPD [<xref rid=""B22"" ref-type=""bibr"">22</xref>,<xref rid=""B23"" ref-type=""bibr"">23</xref>]. ML-NMR can be applied to any connected network with any mixture of individual patient-level data (IPD) and aggregate data, and is a generalization of network meta-regression, which is usually based on aggregate data only. Single-arm studies can be included into the network by matching them to comparator arms of the existing RCTs [<xref rid=""B24"" ref-type=""bibr"">24</xref>,<xref rid=""B25"" ref-type=""bibr"">25</xref>]. ML-NMR is specified as a valid method for population-adjusted ITC by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence [<xref rid=""B21"" ref-type=""bibr"">21</xref>,<xref rid=""B26"" ref-type=""bibr"">26</xref>]. The aim of this study was to provide relative effect estimates for cipa+mig versus aval for a patient population such as in the PROPEL study (i.e., including both ERT-naive [23%] and ERT-experienced [77%] patients with LOPD), reflective of the real-world LOPD population, as demonstrated by ongoing registry studies, in which 78–80% of patients have received ERT previously [<xref rid=""B19"" ref-type=""bibr"">19</xref>,<xref rid=""B20"" ref-type=""bibr"">20</xref>]. We accomplish this objective through an ML-NMR.   No head-to-head trials are currently available comparing aval and cipa+mig in patients with LOPD. After exploring various indirect comparison methodologies, an ML-NMR was chosen as the most appropriate and robust method to make this comparison. We used patient-level data from PROPEL and publicly available data from other studies on aval and cipa+mig (identified through an SLR) to obtain indirect estimates of relative effects and to evaluate how those treatments rank among each other. End points assessed were 6MWD and FVC changes from baseline at week 52, which are standard end points in clinical trials in Pompe disease, and are well accepted by clinicians, health technology assessment agencies and payers [<xref rid=""B58"" ref-type=""bibr"">58</xref>]. Analyses of two networks were conducted: network A, which included only RCTs, and network B, which also included single-arm OLE and phase I/II studies, to enhance the evidence base for the relative effects and, specifically, the effect of aval in ERT-experienced patients. The results from the analysis of network A under the base case scenario (i.e., covariates set to PROPEL values) provided evidence of a less favorable effect of cipa+mig versus aval for both outcomes (6MWD: weak evidence), with the SUCRA score indicating aval as the most efficacious treatment for both end points, followed by cipa+mig. The results from the analysis of network B provided evidence of a favorable effect of cipa+mig versus aval for both outcomes (FVC: strong evidence) that was further supported by the results of other models explored in the analysis of network B. The SUCRA score indicated cipa+mig as the most efficacious treatment option for both end points, followed by aval (FVC) or alglu (6MWD), that led to a mean increase in 6MWD of 28.93 (8.26 to 50.11) m and in FVC of 2.88 (1.07 to 4.71) pp compared with aval. These results show that the positioning of cipa+mig compared with aval changes to superiority when additional evidence on the effect of aval in patients with LOPD previously treated with ERT is included in the analysis. These additional trial data on aval indicated reduced performance of aval in ERT-experienced patients, which explains why the analysis of network B revealed less favorable results for aval in an ERT-experienced LOPD population, which was the dominant population of the PROPEL trial. Exploring the impact of previous ERT duration revealed that the comparison between cipa+mig and aval became more favorable for cipa+mig with increasing previous ERT duration for both end points in the analysis of network B. We can speculate that the reasons for the observed difference in efficacy between cipa-mig and aval (that is most notable for the patients previously treated with alglu) is most likely due to differences in their chemistry and modes of action, though this is a matter of ongoing debate [<xref rid=""B52"" ref-type=""bibr"">52–54</xref>]. Cipa is biologically synthesized with high levels of bis-phosphorylated mannose-6-phosphate and retained endolysosomal glycan processing, which, together with the addition of miglustat, may enable more active enzyme into target tissues. For patients who have been undergoing therapy for an extended period of time, cipa+mig may be able to clear accumulated, and more highly complexed, glycogen in skeletal muscles. This would lead to the differentiation seen between enzymes in the results of network B in terms of functional measures of 6MWD and FVC. To our knowledge, there exists only one other ITC approach comparing cipa+mig and aval. It applied an anchored STC in ERT-naive and an unanchored STC in ERT-experienced patients with LOPD, using data from COMET and PROPEL (ERT-naive subgroup only) for the anchored STC and data from COMET OLE, NEO-1/-EXT, PROPEL and ATB200-02 for the unanchored STC [<xref rid=""B59"" ref-type=""bibr"">59</xref>]. Results of the anchored STC were directionally consistent with the ML-NMR results for network A, but the results of the unanchored STC differed from the ML-NMR results for network B, showing favorable results for aval compared with cipa+mig. This was presumably due to data and analysis limitations such as STC estimates extrapolated from a regression model based on data from few participants (e.g., only 18 patients on aval with previous ERT duration of ≥3 years, whereas >90% of the patients in PROPEL [n = 61] had previous ERT duration ≥3 years) and assumptions made on baseline characteristics not reported separately for ERT-naive and -experienced patients in PROPEL. Our ML-NMR made optimal use of the available data (i.e., individual patient-level data of the PROPEL trial and aggregate data of the other trials included). It is a method recommended by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence's Decision Support Unit [<xref rid=""B26"" ref-type=""bibr"">26</xref>]. In the absence of head-to-head trials, the results of this ITC provide clinically important results and inform decision-making on the optimal choice of treatment in patients with LOPD, with cipa+mig being the treatment option with the highest probability of ranking best among all treatments compared when all available evidence was used in the analysis. We suggest that the differences in chemistry and mode of action between cipa+mig and aval can help explain why cipa+mig appears to be more efficacious in the analysis of network B, and why pre-treated patients are more responsive. The chosen method, ML-NMR, made optimal use of the available evidence, and enabled incorporation of evidence from trials whose included patient populations differed with respect to an important treatment effect modifier, namely previous ERT duration. Clinical evidence will continue to evolve as longer-term data on the effect of Pompe disease treatments become available. This will allow for more robust, long-term relative effect estimates, as well as insights into modes of action that may better explain the underlying clinical differences.  ",N/A,17 9 2024
Health-Related Quality-of-Life Utility Values in Adults With Late-Onset Pompe Disease: Analyses of EQ-5D Data From the PROPEL Clinical Trial,"<bold>Background:</bold> Pompe disease is a rare lysosomal storage disorder, leading to accumulation of glycogen characterized by muscle weakness, fatigue, pain, and, in the longer term, a requirement for ventilatory and ambulatory support, and early mortality if untreated. Clinical evidence suggests that enzyme replacement therapy improves health outcomes for adults with late-onset Pompe disease (LOPD). PROPEL was a Phase 3, double-blind, randomized controlled trial, which evaluated cipaglucosidase alfa plus miglustat, vs alglucosidase alfa plus placebo in 123 adult patients with LOPD (clinicaltrials.gov: NCT03729362). <bold>Objectives:</bold> To analyze EQ-5D health-related quality of life (HRQoL) utility data from PROPEL. <bold>Methods:</bold> Multilevel modeling techniques (mixed regression methods) were used to analyze PROPEL EQ-5D-3L estimates and predict utility values for 7 health states previously identified in an economic evaluation for LOPD. In PROPEL, EQ-5D-5L values were assessed at screening and at weeks 12, 26, 38, and 52. EQ-5D-5L utility values were mapped to EQ-5D-3L values using the van Hout algorithm as recommended by the EuroQoL and the National Institute of Health and Care Excellence position statement at time of analysis. UK population tariffs were applied for all EQ-5D utility valuations. Utility values were predicted according to 6-minute walk distance (6MWD) and percent predicted sitting forced vital capacity. <bold>Results:</bold> The mixed model predicted that EQ-5D-3L utility values for patients who could walk >75 m with LOPD ranged between 0.55 and 0.67 according to patient 6MWD and respiratory function. In this analysis, patients with a 6MWD ≤75 m, consistent with a health state requiring wheelchair support in the economic analysis, had a predicted utility value of 0.49. There were few patients in PROPEL who could walk ≤75 m at any time point in the study, hence, these utility estimates should be interpreted with caution. EQ-5D-3L utility estimates from PROPEL were consistent with previously reported EQ-5D-3L values in LOPD. <bold>Conclusions:</bold> Overall, the results from our analysis indicate that important HRQoL losses are associated with reductions in mobility and respiratory function for patients with Pompe disease. The study provides important evidence of HRQoL utility values for patients with advanced LOPD, a population for whom published data are limited.","Pompe disease is a rare genetic lysosomal storage disorder associated with complete or partial loss of endogenous acid α-glucosidase (GAA) activity, which results in an accumulation of glycogen in the body.<xref rid=""ref-357917"" ref-type=""bibr""><sup>1–3</sup></xref> It is characterized by a progressive loss of muscle function resulting in weakness, fatigue, pain, exercise intolerance and, in the longer term, a requirement for ventilatory and ambulatory support.<xref rid=""ref-357917"" ref-type=""bibr""><sup>1–3</sup></xref> The primary cause of death in patients with Pompe disease is respiratory failure, occurring in approximately 70% of diagnosed patients.<xref rid=""ref-357920"" ref-type=""bibr""><sup>4,5</sup></xref> Pompe disease is associated with significant health-related quality of life (HRQoL) losses over a patient’s lifetime due to the severity of symptoms.<xref rid=""ref-357922"" ref-type=""bibr""><sup>6</sup></xref> There are 2 primary subtypes of Pompe disease: infantile-onset Pompe disease, which presents at a very young age, and late-onset Pompe disease (LOPD), which presents in children, juveniles, and adults.

In a 2021 study by Gutschmidt et al,<xref rid=""ref-357927"" ref-type=""bibr""><sup>11</sup></xref> patients with 3 or more years of alglucosidase alfa treatment at study baseline demonstrated a 14.9% decline in % predicted FVC over the next 10 years of treatment with alglucosidase alfa; over the same time period, the percentage of patients requiring ventilation increased by 33%.<xref rid=""ref-357927"" ref-type=""bibr""><sup>11</sup></xref> Consequently, there remains a significant need for alternative treatments for Pompe disease that are effective and well tolerated. Cipaglucosidase alfa (cipa) is a novel (Chinese hamster ovary cell–derived) rhGAA with enhanced glycosylation for improved cellular uptake and retained capacity for processing into the most active form of the enzyme. Cipa is administered in combination with miglustat (mig; cipa + mig; Pombiliti<sup>®</sup>/Opfolda<sup>®</sup>), an orally administered small-molecule stabilizer of cipa, which acts in the circulation so that catalytic activity is maintained upon uptake to the muscles.<xref rid=""ref-357928"" ref-type=""bibr""><sup>12,13</sup></xref> Cipa + mig has recently received market authorization from the US Food and Drug Administration, the European Medicines Agency, and the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency in the United Kingdom following positive results from the pivotal PROPEL clinical trial (clinicaltrials.gov: NCT03729362).<xref rid=""ref-357919"" ref-type=""bibr""><sup>3,14–16</sup></xref> PROPEL was a multicenter, international, Phase 3 randomized controlled trial designed to evaluate cipa + mig vs alglucosidase alfa plus placebo (alg + pbo) in 123 adult patients with LOPD.<xref rid=""ref-357919"" ref-type=""bibr""><sup>3</sup></xref> In PROPEL, cipa + mig was associated with clinically meaningful improvements in key motor and respiratory outcomes compared with standard-of-care ERT.<xref rid=""ref-357919"" ref-type=""bibr""><sup>3</sup></xref> The PROPEL clinical study also indicated numeric improvements for cipa + mig vs alg + pbo in most patient-reported outcomes.<xref rid=""ref-357919"" ref-type=""bibr""><sup>3</sup></xref> The overall aim of this study was to predict EQ-5D utility estimates for health states associated with LOPD, which have been defined according to patient mobility (6MWD) and respiratory function (% predicted FVC). It is anticipated that the results from these analyses will improve the evidence base for Pompe disease currently available to healthcare decision makers.   The PROPEL trial demonstrated that cipa + mig was associated with clinically meaningful improvements in key motor and respiratory outcomes compared with alg + pbo in adult patients with LOPD.<xref rid=""ref-357919"" ref-type=""bibr""><sup>3</sup></xref> The objective of this study was to analyze EQ-5D data from PROPEL according to treatment, key clinical outcomes (% predicted FVC, 6MWD) and other potential predictors of HRQoL to provide utility estimates for key health states previously associated with Pompe disease. In the base-case analysis we have developed a mixed model using longitudinal EQ-5D-3L estimates from PROPEL. This model indicated only 6MWD (and sex) were strongly associated with patient HRQoL utility scores. The EQ-5D-3L utility values for non-wheelchair-dependent LOPD patients ranged from 0.55 (6MWD >75 to ≤250 m) to 0.67 (6MWD >250 m), while patients with a 6MWD ≤75 m, who were likely to require wheelchair support, were estimated to have a utility value of 0.49. The current study has used the van Hout crosswalk algorithm to map EQ-5D-5L values to EQ-5D-3L as recommended by EuroQoL and in keeping with the NICE EQ-5D-5L position statement at the time of the analysis. It is acknowledged that the current NICE health technology assessment manual recommends an alternative mapping function by Hernandez-Alava et al.<xref rid=""ref-357934"" ref-type=""bibr""><sup>18,24</sup></xref> Comparisons of the 2 approaches suggest only small differences in goodness-of-fit, and we do not anticipate that the use of the Hernandez-Alava approach would alter conclusions from this study.<xref rid=""ref-357939"" ref-type=""bibr""><sup>23,24</sup></xref> The limitations of this study are primarily associated with the data available, which were constrained by the rarity of the disease. PROPEL, although the largest randomized controlled trial to date in Pompe disease, was a relatively small study (n = 123), and the eligibility criteria required all patients to be ambulatory and requiring ≤6 hours/day ventilatory support. This meant that few patients were in the later stages of disease progression, which made predictions for more health states associated with more severe disease challenging. It is acknowledged that the study may not have been powered specifically to adequately characterize the effect of all variables that impact patient HRQoL, reflecting this common challenge in rare disease trials. Multivariable analyses indicated that when both % predicted FVC and 6MWD were included in the regression model, % predicted FVC was no longer a significant predictor of HRQoL and there was evidence of collinearity, hence % predicted FVC was not included in the final equation. Thus, to provide utility values for health states associated with respiratory function, a separate risk equation was developed based purely on % predicted FVC as an explanatory variable. It is noted that the algorithm was based on the same data as the algorithm for 6MWD, hence, the combination of these estimates may result in some overestimation of the utility losses associated with composite health states, which include reductions in both respiratory function and patient mobility. Nevertheless, despite these limitations, this study provides important evidence of HRQoL utility values across the spectrum of health states for patients with LOPD, a population for whom there are currently limited published data. The utility estimates in this study are highly consistent with estimates of EQ-5D utility values from the small number of previously published studies in LOPD.<xref rid=""ref-357922"" ref-type=""bibr""><sup>6,8</sup></xref> Notably, a recent NICE health technology assessment of avalglucosidase alfa (Nexviadyme™) in Pompe disease (TA821) indicated that non-wheelchair-dependent patients may have an EQ-5D-3L utility value between 0.55 and 0.65 according to patient mobility and respiratory support requirements (<bold><xref rid=""attachment-245595"" ref-type=""table"">Table 6</xref></bold>).<xref rid=""ref-357924"" ref-type=""bibr""><sup>8</sup></xref> The closeness of these estimates to EQ-5D 3L values we have derived from PROPEL suggests cross-validity between studies. It is acknowledged that a recent vignette study by Hubig et al reported lower utility EQ-5D-5L values for LOPD patients than PROPEL. This difference may be explained by differences in the methods of utility estimation between the vignette study and the PROPEL clinical trial.<xref rid=""ref-357919"" ref-type=""bibr""><sup>3,6</sup></xref> The vignette study created a series of health state descriptions based on interviews with patients with LOPD and UK clinical experts. One hundred members of the general public were asked to imagine they were in the vignette health states and value their HRQoL utility value using 3 elicitation methods: EQ-5D-5L, visual analog scale, and time trade-off (TTO). PROPEL utility values were based on EQ-5D-5L questionnaires completed by 123 adults with LOPD. It has been noted elsewhere that individuals in the general population are likely to overstate the disability in a given health state compared with those who have been suffering from the disease and adapting to their condition over time. Furthermore, in the vignette study, there was some inconsistency between utility values estimated from the 3 different elicitation methods: notably, EQ-5D-5L values were much lower than TTO values. The vignette TTO values were more consistent with EQ-5D-3L results presented in this work than the vignette EQ-5D-5L values. It was unclear why the vignette EQ-5D-5L results were low, but this trend has been seen in previous research.<xref rid=""ref-357938"" ref-type=""bibr""><sup>22</sup></xref> These findings provide an interesting insight into the potential challenges associated with estimating utilities in rare diseases when utility data are not captured within the clinical study itself. Very few patients were in the late stages of LOPD progression in the PROPEL trial; hence, predictions from our study for patients in more severe health states data may not be reliable and should be interpreted with appropriate caution. In particular, it is noted that no patients who were wheelchair-dependent were using invasive ventilation in PROPEL. The reported utility value has been derived using strong assumptions regarding the relative loss in utility for patients requiring invasive ventilation. These assumptions merit further clinical validation, and the values derived are difficult to cross-validate, since utility values for severe LOPD health states have been rarely reported in the published literature. The vignette study by Hubig et al suggested that EQ-5D-5L patient utility for this health state would be less than 0 (ie, this health state was valued as worse than death), although, in the NICE appraisal of cipa + mig, the NICE Evidence Assessment Group noted that it is rare to apply utility values that are significantly below 0.50, and rarer still to assign negative utility values.<xref rid=""ref-357920"" ref-type=""bibr""><sup>4</sup></xref> It is noted that mixed models cannot consider any bias associated with data not missing at random. Informative censoring may occur when patients in poorer health do not provide HRQoL responses. While this may be an important consideration in Pompe disease due to the severity of symptoms, given the relatively earlier stage of disease progression of patients in PROPEL and high completion rate, it is not considered an issue in this study. We have estimated utility values for 7 health states, which have been defined according to patient respiratory function and mobility commonly associated with LOPD. Overall, the results from our analysis indicate that important HRQoL losses are associated with reductions in mobility and respiratory function for patients with Pompe disease. The study provides important evidence of HRQoL utility values for patients with LOPD, including advanced LOPD, a population for whom there are currently limited published data. ",N/A,18 9 2024
Bulbar muscle impairment in patients with late onset Pompe disease: Insight from the French Pompe registry,,"Pompe disease, also called glycogen storage disease type II (MIM#232300), is a rare neuromuscular disorder caused by a deficit in acid alpha‐glucosidase. Phenotype range is wide, from very severe forms, with infantile onset characterized by early cardiorespiratory failure, to late onset Pompe disease (LOPD), with patients developing progressive limb girdle weakness and diaphragmatic involvement [<xref rid=""ene16428-bib-0001"" ref-type=""bibr"">1</xref>]. In recent years, some studies have focused on macroglossia in adult LOPD patients [<xref rid=""ene16428-bib-0002"" ref-type=""bibr"">2</xref>], a symptom initially described in 1968 by Hudgson et al. [<xref rid=""ene16428-bib-0003"" ref-type=""bibr"">3</xref>], who reported on the observation of a 44‐year‐old woman presenting with an enlarged tongue and mild lingual dysarthria. These swallowing difficulties are probably an undervalued symptom that can have important repercussions in patients' daily life, such as dysarthria, dysphagia, and sleep apneas [<xref rid=""ene16428-bib-0004"" ref-type=""bibr"">4</xref>, <xref rid=""ene16428-bib-0005"" ref-type=""bibr"">5</xref>, <xref rid=""ene16428-bib-0006"" ref-type=""bibr"">6</xref>, <xref rid=""ene16428-bib-0007"" ref-type=""bibr"">7</xref>, <xref rid=""ene16428-bib-0008"" ref-type=""bibr"">8</xref>]. More recent studies focusing on assessment of tongue strength in small cohorts of patients showed decreased tongue muscle strength in a majority of those patients [<xref rid=""ene16428-bib-0009"" ref-type=""bibr"">9</xref>], as could be expected considering the early fat replacement of these muscles in muscle magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of patients with LOPD [<xref rid=""ene16428-bib-0010"" ref-type=""bibr"">10</xref>]. However, the prevalence and clinical manifestation of tongue involvement have never been studied among a large cohort of LOPD patients. The aim of this study was to evaluate the prevalence and the clinical impact of bulbar muscle involvement in a French cohort of adult LOPD patients, which has been tracked by the French Pompe disease registry for 20 years [<xref rid=""ene16428-bib-0011"" ref-type=""bibr"">11</xref>, <xref rid=""ene16428-bib-0012"" ref-type=""bibr"">12</xref>].   Although tongue involvement is a clearly established sign of LOPD, leading to significant swallowing impairment in some patients, the prevalence and clinical impact of this manifestation has not yet been studied extensively in the population of LOPD patients. Thanks to the French neuromuscular network (FILNEMUS), we have been able to systematically collect both clinical symptoms and data extracted from questionnaires assessing bulbar muscle involvement in a large cohort of 100 patients in the French Pompe registry. The main finding of our study through this cohort representing LOPD patients is the high frequency of bulbar muscle impairment in this population, with 32% of patients complaining of swallowing difficulties. These symptoms are often mild, but can be severe in some patients, potentially leading to percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy and affecting patients' quality of life. These swallowing disturbances are often predominant with solids and dry food but can also affect liquids or saliva. Although the presence of swallowing difficulty is not correlated with age in our study, we nevertheless note that the four most severe cases in our cohort were >60 years old. Several age‐related pathologies can also promote the occurrence or increase of swallowing disorders, such as stroke, neurodegenerative diseases, or dental conditions. On the other hand, they are significantly correlated with the duration of progression of the disease, with no significant result for time between firsts symptoms and beginning of ERT. It is interesting to emphasize that swallowing disorders are not associated with more severe respiratory dysfunction as is often the case in neuromuscular diseases. Patients with swallowing disorders do not require more ventilation assistance, and their vital capacity is no different from patients without swallowing disorders. Furthermore, the patients with swallowing disorders present a lower BMI, and only 15% of them are followed by a speech therapist. This underlines that these difficulties are often undervalued and thus undertreated. Being proactive in the early detection of dysphagia in LOPD patients will then allow anticipation of severe consequences such as undernutrition or inhalation pneumonia. Considering the tools available to screen swallowing disorder, we have chosen to use the Salassa score to classify patients into subgroups with or without swallowing difficulties. This simple and quick score can be carried out routinely. It has already been shown to have positive results in detecting swallowing disorders in other neuromuscular disorders, such as in oculopharyngeal muscular dystrophy by Trollet et al. [<xref rid=""ene16428-bib-0018"" ref-type=""bibr"">18</xref>]. This score can be used as a screening test before clinical evaluation to refer patients if necessary to specialized evaluation by a speech therapist. The R‐Pact, used routinely to evaluate Pompe patients, presents good specificity but mild sensitivity in detecting swallowing difficulties. The results of our study extend the knowledge on tongue involvement in LOPD patients and are consistent with the study of Dubrovsky et al. [<xref rid=""ene16428-bib-0005"" ref-type=""bibr"">5</xref>], which assessed tongue strength in 19 consecutive LOPD patients with manual muscle testing and reported dysarthria and/or dysphagia in seven of 19 patients (37%). It should be noted that all patients examined in this study exhibited lingual weakness, even if no swallowing disorders were reported. These findings have then been confirmed by a study of quantitative assessment of lingual strength in 30 LOPD patients [<xref rid=""ene16428-bib-0009"" ref-type=""bibr"">9</xref>], showing tongue weakness in 80% of patients; severity was estimated as mild in 29%, moderate in 29%, and severe in 42%. In a subsequent study, Jones et al. [<xref rid=""ene16428-bib-0019"" ref-type=""bibr"">19</xref>] confirmed that patients diagnosed with LOPD have significantly decreased tongue strength with both manual and quantitative muscle testing and found increased echo intensity of tongue muscles and decreased muscle thickness at ultrasound. These findings strongly suggest the existence of fibrofatty replacement of lingual muscles even in asymptomatic LOPD patients. Tongue MRI was also studied in LOPD patients, and the bright tongue sign described in these patients [<xref rid=""ene16428-bib-0020"" ref-type=""bibr"">20</xref>] suggests as well fibrofatty replacement and could be a quite specific sign to search for when diagnosing a muscle weakness. Considering the difficulties in clinically defining macroglossia, imagery could also help to quantify precisely the volume of tongue using MRI or ultrasound imaging. The correlation between swallowing disorders and measuring of tongue volume could be explored in further dedicated studies. Physiopathology of the swallowing disorders and the reason for specific fatty infiltration in the tongue remain for now unclear. To our knowledge, no study has yet been done on that subject. Mechanisms of these swallowing difficulties could also be clarified with fiberoptic endoscopic evaluation of swallowing. More recently, Dupé et al. [<xref rid=""ene16428-bib-0002"" ref-type=""bibr"">2</xref>] reported five cases of LOPD patients who presented macroglossia, all but one suffering from symptoms related to macroglossia before the diagnosis of Pompe disease. Among these patients, two had severe dysphagia, one of whom underwent percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy. In this latest study, swallowing difficulties seemed to be associated with macroglossia and longer duration of illness, and patients often complained of dysarthria and excessive saliva. The strength of our study was the data collection of signs and symptoms allowing us to assess the incidence and severity of bulbar muscle involvement in a large cohort of LOPD patients, thus objectively reflecting the significance of these. Limitations of this cross‐sectional study are the lack of consensus on clinical definition of macroglossia. Quantitative evaluation of the tongue volume with MRI or tongue muscle strength with dynamometry would be more accurate but unfortunately is not performed routinely. In addition, this study does not allow the assessment of the rate of progression over time of these symptoms, because the introduction of these swallowing questionnaires in the French Pompe registry is only recent. Including these clinical assessments and questionnaires in the yearly follow‐up of LOPD patients will allow us to improve our knowledge of the evolution speed and severity of these symptoms. As a consequence of the cross‐sectional nature of this study, we have not been able to evaluate the effect of ERT on progression of the tongue involvement either. Considering the early fatty replacement of tongue muscle in patients with Pompe disease and its potential severity, symptoms relating to tongue weakness and changes in size should probably be taken into account in future long‐term studies evaluating the benefit of innovative treatments. The collection of these data is ongoing in the French Pompe registry. In conclusion, swallowing difficulties are reported for 32% of adult LOPD patients included in the French Pompe Disease registry and result in repercussions in patients' quality of life. Bulbar involvement is additional evidence that Pompe disease is a multisystemic disease that needs regular systemic evaluation. These symptoms require an increased awareness of physicians of the need to systematically examine the tongue and swallowing in LOPD patients, thus recognizing these symptoms can enable multidisciplinary care with a speech therapist, dietitian, and ear, nose, and throat specialist if needed. A delay in recognition of these symptoms could lead to undernutrition or inhalation pneumonia, with a potentially severe impact on vital prognosis and quality of life of LOPD patients. Future studies will be necessary to refine knowledge on the impact of ERT on swallowing disorders for adult LOPD patients.

Non-invasive optoacoustic imaging of glycogen-storage and muscle degeneration in late-onset Pompe disease,"Pompe disease (PD) is a rare autosomal recessive glycogen storage disorder that causes proximal muscle weakness and loss of respiratory function. While enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) is the only effective treatment, biomarkers for disease monitoring are scarce. Following ex vivo biomarker validation in phantom studies, we apply multispectral optoacoustic tomography (MSOT), a laser- and ultrasound-based non-invasive imaging approach, in a clinical trial (NCT05083806) to image the biceps muscles of 10 late-onset PD (LOPD) patients and 10 matched healthy controls. MSOT is compared with muscle magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), ultrasound, spirometry, muscle testing and quality of life scores. Next, results are validated in an independent LOPD patient cohort from a second clinical site. Our study demonstrates that MSOT enables imaging of subcellular disease pathology with increases in glycogen/water, collagen and lipid signals, providing higher sensitivity in detecting muscle degeneration than current methods. This translational approach suggests implementation in the complex care of these rare disease patients. Pompe disease (PD) is a rare disorder that leads to progressive muscle weakness if left untreated. Here, the authors use multispectral optoacoustic tomography (MSOT) to map and quantify the composition of affected muscle tissue to determine disease severity and potentially monitor future therapies.","Pompe disease (PD) is a rare, autosomal-recessive metabolic myopathy caused by mutations in the gene that encodes for acid alpha-glucosidase (GAA)<sup><xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR1"">1</xref>–<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR3"">3</xref></sup>. Regularly, GAA catalyzes the hydrolysis of glycogen to glucose, but in PD, its impaired activity results in a generalized build-up of glycogen in metabolic active organs, such as heart, muscle and liver<sup><xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR4"">4</xref>,<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR5"">5</xref></sup>. The disease progress is variable in age of onset, severity of organ involvement and degree of myopathy<sup><xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR6"">6</xref></sup>. There is a differentiation in infantile (IOPD) and late-onset (LOPD) forms based on cardiac involvement, age of onset and residual enzyme activity<sup><xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR7"">7</xref></sup>. IOPD patients may have less than 1% GAA activity, therefore, quickly develop severe symptoms, such as cardiac involvement, resulting in a high mortality rate by year one if untreated<sup><xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR1"">1</xref>,<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR8"">8</xref></sup>. Children and adults with LOPD have residual enzyme activity below 30%, leading to more slowly progressive limb-girdle type weakness and respiratory insufficiency<sup><xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR9"">9</xref>,<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR10"">10</xref></sup>. Replacement therapies (ERT) are available, leading to a slower progression of cardiac and musculoskeletal involvement, prevention of deterioration of pulmonary function and increasing survival<sup><xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR11"">11</xref>–<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR14"">14</xref></sup>. However, an early initiation of treatment may positively impact the overall treatment response<sup><xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR15"">15</xref></sup>. The diagnosis of PD is usually established by confirmation of GAA deficiency, and confirmed by genetic testing<sup><xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR16"">16</xref>,<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR17"">17</xref></sup>. Furthermore, PD patients require regular clinical follow-up monitoring, especially to assess the response to ERT<sup><xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR8"">8</xref>,<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR9"">9</xref>,<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR17"">17</xref>–<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR20"">20</xref></sup>. While rapid determination of GAA in dried blood spots is possible, enzymatic analysis is unable to discriminate between patients with PD and those individuals harboring pseudo deficiency mutations. In this regard, a tetraglucose oligomer (Glc(4)) in the urine and maltotetraose (Hex4) in plasma may hold promise as a biomarker to identify PD patients from individuals harboring pseudo deficiency mutations<sup><xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR21"">21</xref></sup> and even to assess response to ERT<sup><xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR22"">22</xref>,<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR23"">23</xref></sup>. However, the interpretation of the values is not trivial and must be considered with respect to the individual age of the patient<sup><xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR18"">18</xref></sup>. Therefore, follow-up is mostly ensured by clinical and functional tests, which are essentially dependent on the individual patient’s active cooperation and performance<sup><xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR1"">1</xref></sup>. More recently, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies in LOPD demonstrated significant correlations between muscle involvement and function<sup><xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR24"">24</xref>–<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR26"">26</xref></sup> or efficacy of enzyme replacement therapy and degree of lipomatous muscle alterations<sup><xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR27"">27</xref></sup>. Moreover, it clearly identifies the proximal to distal involvement pattern of the disease<sup><xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR25"">25</xref></sup>. Particularly in young patients, MRI has attributable risks for the requirement of sedation or difficult positioning for patients with respiratory impairment. Therefore, there is an unmet need for non-invasive techniques to better and more objectively assess disease involvement directly in the muscles of PD patients with the lowest burden possible. In this regard, multispectral optoacoustic tomography (MSOT) may be used to quantitatively image subcellular tissue composition and visualize disease-specific muscle changes<sup><xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR28"">28</xref>–<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR31"">31</xref></sup>. MSOT applies the principle of “light in and sound out” through short-pulsed near-infrared laser emission and ultrasound detection, enabling it to retrieve deep-tissue information<sup><xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR32"">32</xref>–<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR37"">37</xref></sup>. The mechanism of thermal expansion-based optoacoustic imaging (OAI) is that optical energy is absorbed by tissue chromophores, such as hemoglobins, lipids, water or collagens, causing localized heating and expansion, generating detectable acoustic pressure waves<sup><xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR38"">38</xref></sup>. In this work, we show that in LOPD patients, MSOT enables imaging of subcellular disease pathology with increases in glycogen/water, collagen and lipid signals, providing higher sensitivity to detect muscle degeneration than current methods.  The findings presented here provide a rationale for a novel, non-invasive, radiation-free, and easy-applicable imaging modality to visualize disease-specific muscle patterns in LOPD patients. From a clinical perspective, we demonstrate the feasibility of MSOT to detect tissue remodeling caused by glycogen and its related higher water content. In the clinical imaging setup, glycogen in H<sub>2</sub>O has higher MSOT signals and a pronounced peak at 980 nm compared to pure H<sub>2</sub>O. Studying muscle-mimicking phantoms, we found similar optoacoustic signal behavior correlating to the concentration of glycogen. Considering these results, we hypothesize that the current clinical optoacoustic system most likely visualizes glycogen-bound water. Taking this into consideration, we retrieved increased lipid and collagen signals as a sign of muscle degeneration in clinical subjects—also likely affected by the high glycogen-bound water in the muscle tissue. In contrast to our MSOT imaging findings, clinical routine US or MRI techniques were not feasible to visualize similar features in LOPD patients. Moreover, MSOT imaging is easily transferable to a second clinical center providing comparable imaging results. This unpins the utility and potential for MSOT for future non-invasive treatment monitoring in PD patients. Currently, the first-line treatment in PD (IOPD and LOPD) is enzyme replacement therapy (ERT). In order to increase uptake, it is glycosylated with mannose-6-phosphate (M6P), which binds to cation-independent mannose-6-phosphate receptors (CIMPR) on cell membranes<sup><xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR44"">44</xref>–<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR46"">46</xref></sup>. This allows affected tissue cells to take up the exogenous enzyme and increase their capability to degrade glycogen, subsequently clearing the excessive glycogen storages<sup><xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR11"">11</xref>,<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR47"">47</xref></sup>. However, the affection of endocytic and autophagic pathways and the development of GAA-antibodies have a significant impact on trafficking and processing of ERT and subsequent therapeutic response<sup><xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR48"">48</xref></sup>. As a consequence, the majority of patients show improvement or stabilization of respiratory and muscular functions, with more prominent effects at earlier stages of disease<sup><xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR49"">49</xref>,<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR50"">50</xref></sup>. Laboratory biomarkers, including the assessment of GAA activity in dried blood spots or the analysis of Glc4 and Hex4, are applicable but not widely available or standardized across different centers<sup><xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR21"">21</xref>–<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR23"">23</xref></sup>. Common tools to monitor PD patients are function-related, rely on active cooperation, may show a learning effect, and thus may not be sufficiently objective enough<sup><xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR51"">51</xref>–<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR53"">53</xref></sup>. Moreover, therapeutic monitoring is currently becoming even more important because, in addition to new ERTs<sup><xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR47"">47</xref>,<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR54"">54</xref></sup>, genetic interventions for PD patients are also on the horizon<sup><xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR55"">55</xref>,<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR56"">56</xref></sup>. Second, early identification of LOPD patients in newborn screening programs may require more precise phenotyping<sup><xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR57"">57</xref></sup>. Imaging technologies may offer the advantage of directly assessing changes in muscle structure and composition. The quantification of intramuscular fat or fat fraction (FF) has been shown to provide a solid correlation with muscle function and clinical outcomes in adults<sup><xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR24"">24</xref>,<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR25"">25</xref>,<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR58"">58</xref>–<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR60"">60</xref></sup>. Less consistent results, as demonstrated in our study, facilitated the development of more sophisticated muscle MRI sequences, including diffusion tensor imaging<sup><xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR26"">26</xref></sup> or glycogen spectroscopy<sup><xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR61"">61</xref>,<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR62"">62</xref></sup>. Even without the presence of significantly increased fatty infiltration, these techniques can depict structural changes<sup><xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR26"">26</xref></sup>. However, MRI may have several disadvantages, such as high costs, limited availability, lack of (inter-center) protocol standardization, and long examination time coupled with strict positioning of the patient. With progress in standardization and further clinical translation<sup><xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR63"">63</xref>,<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR64"">64</xref></sup> as shown in this study, MSOT may enable easy-applicable imaging phenotyping of PD patients. The capability of MSOT has already been explored in gastroenterology<sup><xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR41"">41</xref>,<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR65"">65</xref>–<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR68"">68</xref></sup>, rheumatology<sup><xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR69"">69</xref></sup>, cardiovascular<sup><xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR70"">70</xref></sup> and cancer medicine<sup><xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR71"">71</xref></sup> or more specifically in muscle applications<sup><xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR42"">42</xref></sup> such as Duchenne muscular dystrophy<sup><xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR28"">28</xref></sup> and spinal muscular atrophy<sup><xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR30"">30</xref></sup>. In this study, we assume that we were able to depict and quantify the muscle remodeling with localized glycogen accumulation, subsequently leading to fibro-fatty replacement and muscle atrophy. The spectral unmixed parameters, MSOT<sub>lip</sub> and MSOT<sub>col</sub>, support our hypothesis that MSOT is capable of detecting such processes in the affected muscle. In conclusion, MSOT holds great potential to become a sensitive imaging technology for diagnosing, phenotyping and monitoring patients with LOPD. With the increasing importance and availability of gene therapy, early treatment is vital. The findings of this work suggest the implementation of MSOT imaging into the comprehensive and complex care of these rare disease patients and could possibly reduce other more invasive procedures in the future. The next step should be a follow-up study including pediatric patients (both with IOPD and LOPD). Nevertheless, this study has several limitations to consider. It is constrained by a small and heterogeneous sample size, which is attributed to the rarity of PD patients and the diversity in its clinical manifestations. Furthermore, MSOT is influenced by optical absorbers such as melanin, making it suitable primarily for individuals with lighter skin color and holds a maximum penetration depth of approximately 2.5 cm restricting MSOT application in certain cases and regions of the body. Further work is needed to develop a PD-specific methodology to evaluate disease-specific muscle involvement at different stages of the disease that relate to clinical findings. Moreover, optoacoustic imaging systems are still a novel imaging approach that have to be further improved and standardized<sup><xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR64"">64</xref></sup>. Unmixing algorithms, reconstruction technique and analysis have to be enhanced to improve the quality of data<sup><xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR64"">64</xref>,<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR72"">72</xref></sup>.

Avalglucosidase alfa in infantile-onset Pompe disease: A snapshot of real-world experience in Italy,,"Pompe disease, glycogenosis type II, (OMIM <ext-link ext-link-type=""omim"" http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink href=""232300"" id=""ir0005"">232300</ext-link>) is a glycogen storage disorder caused by deficiency of the lysosomal enzyme acid alpha-glucosidase, and mainly involves skeletal and cardiac muscles [<xref rid=""bb0005"" ref-type=""bibr"">1</xref>]. Mutations in the <italic toggle=""yes"">GAA</italic> gene on chromosome 17q25, causing severe enzyme deficiency, are associated with infantile-onset Pompe disease (IOPD), the earliest and most severe form. The clinical picture of IOPD is characterized by severe hypotonia, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, macroglossia, and liver enlargement with onset in the first six months of life. In our experience, a variable degree of severity is present, with some patients showing hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and severe hypotonia after birth, and other manifesting clear signs in the first weeks or months of life. Mutations in <italic toggle=""yes"">GAA</italic> that allow some degree of enzyme synthesis and function cause later onset and slowly progressive clinical pictures (late onset Pompe disease, LOPD) which mimic other progressive myopathies (Limb-girdle dystrophy or Duchenne/Becker dystrophies) [<xref rid=""bb0005"" ref-type=""bibr"">[1]</xref>, <xref rid=""bb0010"" ref-type=""bibr"">[2]</xref>, <xref rid=""bb0015"" ref-type=""bibr"">[3]</xref>]. LOPD can also be diagnosed in the first year of life, in the absence of clear signs, through family history or newborn screening. Moreover, biochemical clues such as hypertransaminasemia or increased creatine kinase (CK) can be incidentally identified during routine investigations in infancy. Since 2006 alglucosidase alfa (rhGAA) has been available for enzyme replacement therapy (ERT). Without treatment, patients with IOPD do not learn to walk and typically die within the first year of life, mainly because of progressive cardio-respiratory failure. ERT significantly changed the disease course, avoiding early death. Nevertheless, patients treated with ERT have variable outcomes that are mainly related to diagnostic delays. Some patients reach acceptable motor function, even if in the context of a variable myopathic clinical picture, while others never walk and need ventilatory assistance [<xref rid=""bb0015"" ref-type=""bibr"">[3]</xref>, <xref rid=""bb0020"" ref-type=""bibr"">[4]</xref>, <xref rid=""bb0025"" ref-type=""bibr"">[5]</xref>, <xref rid=""bb0030"" ref-type=""bibr"">[6]</xref>]. Outcome-determining factors, at the time of initiation of ERT, are age and severity of the clinical picture [<xref rid=""bb0020"" ref-type=""bibr"">4</xref>,<xref rid=""bb0035"" ref-type=""bibr"">7</xref>]. Moreover, status of cross-reactive immunological material (CRIM) and antibody formation against rhGAA play a critical role in hampering the efficacy of ERT, necessitating an immunomodulation protocol at the start of treatment [<xref rid=""bb0035"" ref-type=""bibr"">7</xref>,<xref rid=""bb0040"" ref-type=""bibr"">8</xref>]. To date, variable dosages have been used to obtain the best possible results [<xref rid=""bb0020"" ref-type=""bibr"">4</xref>,<xref rid=""bb0045"" ref-type=""bibr"">9</xref>,<xref rid=""bb0050"" ref-type=""bibr"">10</xref>]. The uptake of exogenous lysosomal enzymes by receptors and their transfer into lysosomes improves with higher levels of mannose-6-phosphate (M6P) [<xref rid=""bb0055"" ref-type=""bibr"">11</xref>]. Thus, with the aim of improving the efficacy of rhGAA a new enzyme, avalglucosidase alfa (neoGAA) was glycoengineered, which is conjugated with bis-M6P to enhance its uptake in muscle tissue [<xref rid=""bb0060"" ref-type=""bibr"">12</xref>]<italic toggle=""yes"">.</italic> Positive results following treatment with neoGAA in patients with LOPD (COMET study) have been reported [<xref rid=""bb0065"" ref-type=""bibr"">[13]</xref>, <xref rid=""bb0070"" ref-type=""bibr"">[14]</xref>, <xref rid=""bb0075"" ref-type=""bibr"">[15]</xref>]. A Mini COMET study investigating the use of neoGAA was also carried out that enrolled 22 pediatric patients (aged 1 to 12 years) with IOPD in an open Phase 2 trial using escalating doses. Preliminary results have demonstrated a positive impact on motor and cardiac function as well as on biomarkers [<xref rid=""bb0080"" ref-type=""bibr"">16</xref>,<xref rid=""bb0085"" ref-type=""bibr"">17</xref>]. In 2022, neoGAA was made available in Italy by Sanofi through a compassionate use program in 4 Italian centers. Herein, we report on four patients with IOPD who switched to neoGAA after being treated for an average of 11.5 years with rhGAA.   >15 years after the introduction of ERT, good clinical results in patients with Pompe disease have been described in several studies. Dornelles et al. [<xref rid=""bb0100"" ref-type=""bibr"">20</xref>] carried out a large systematic review and meta-analysis of published experiences in LOPD. It was concluded that there is evidence that rhGAA increases endurance, as shown by 6MWT, and is associated with improved quality of life and decreased time on ventilation support. They also underlined the importance of starting treatment in a timely fashion, although some studies pointed to a possible decline of efficacy after 3–5 years of treatment [<xref rid=""bb0105"" ref-type=""bibr"">21</xref>]<italic toggle=""yes"">.</italic> Overall, patients with IOPD treated with a high dose (40 mg/kg/week or every other week) of rhGAA showed prolonged overall survival and invasive ventilation-free survival [<xref rid=""bb0110"" ref-type=""bibr"">22</xref>]. Improvements in cardiomyopathy and motor skills are also observed [<xref rid=""bb0115"" ref-type=""bibr"">23</xref>,<xref rid=""bb0120"" ref-type=""bibr"">24</xref>]. In 2018, van Capelle et al. [<xref rid=""bb0125"" ref-type=""bibr"">25</xref>] investigated the effects of ERT on cardiac features and found that LVMI normalized after 30 weeks of treatment and was maintained for 4.8 years. More recently, Scheffers et al. [<xref rid=""bb0130"" ref-type=""bibr"">26</xref>] reported on 27 patients treated with ERT who were followed for a median of 9.9 years. It was reported that cardiac function, measured using myocardial deformation analysis, normalized within 1 year after the start of ERT and was stable over time. Nevertheless, despite early diagnosis and treatment, and reaching older ages, when compared to the natural history of the untreated disease, a subset of patients with severe IOPD do not gain motor skills and may also demonstrate significant heart involvement. The availability of ERT has represented an important therapeutic opportunity for patients with Pompe disease, given the significant impact on the clinical course of disease. However, as the treated cohort becomes larger and the patients become older, new challenges are being unveiled. Involvement of the central nervous system has been described in surviving patients [<xref rid=""bb0135"" ref-type=""bibr"">27</xref>]. Hsu et al. collected data on 19 patients from Taiwan who started ERT very early (within the first month of life). These patients were followed for 17 years by regular MRI investigation. White matter abnormalities were estimated using a scoring system for metachromatic leukodystrophy. The authors reported that all patients showed progressive white matter anomalies along with possible neuroaxonal injury for the correlation found with neurofilament levels in plasma. Indeed, there is evidence that levels of neurofilament protein in cerebrospinal fluid and blood are a sensitive, although unspecific, marker of axonal injury and neuronal damage [<xref rid=""bb0140"" ref-type=""bibr"">28</xref>]. Unfortunately, our patients #1 and #2 could not be investigated by imaging as the parents denied their consent, being fearful of the need for general anesthesia. Nevertheless, neither patient had clear neurological signs. Patients #3 and #4 had periventricular white matter changes, which remained stable on neoGAA. Another issue is hearing impairment, which was also present in our cases #2 and #3. The most commonly described type of hearing impairment is sensorineural. Kishnani et al. described inner ear involvement in patients with IOPD in a retrospective, multicenter study on the natural history of the disease in 2006 [<xref rid=""bb0145"" ref-type=""bibr"">29</xref>]. In a recent survey on IOPD patients in Taiwan, identified through newborn screening and treated early with rhGAA ERT, Hsueh et al. documented the occurrence of hearing impairment in 6 of 11 cases and 5 were of the sensorineural type. They stressed the positive role of early ERT thanks to identification by newborn screening [<xref rid=""bb0150"" ref-type=""bibr"">30</xref>]. Nevertheless, as shown by our two patients, despite early and long-term treatment, hearing failure may still occur and represents another concern for these patients. The need to improve outcomes has pushed researchers to focus on the possible enhanced capture by lysosomes and deriving increased effect of ERT through the association with chaperons [<xref rid=""bb0155"" ref-type=""bibr"">31</xref>] or the synthesis of new recombinant enzymes enriched in M6P [<xref rid=""bb0060"" ref-type=""bibr"">12</xref>]. In this regard, neoGAA was developed and the first studies on the late onset forms confirmed its higher efficacy compared to rhGAA. The phase 3 multicenter/multinational study (COMET), designed to evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, and efficacy of neoGAA in LOPD in patients ≥18 years, showed significant benefits in terms of stabilization and improvement of respiratory and motor functions without significant adverse events [<xref rid=""bb0065"" ref-type=""bibr"">13</xref>]. Younger patients were enrolled in Mini-COMET, a phase 2, open label, ascending dose study. A total of 22 patients with IOPD aged 1 to 12 years, previously treated with rhGAA, were selected based on either clinical decline or a suboptimal response to treatment. Preliminary results have indicated a rapid improvement in ptosis [<xref rid=""bb0160"" ref-type=""bibr"">32</xref>]. More recent results reported improvement in motor function as measured by GMFM-88, QMFT and POMPE Pedi (Pompe specific Pediatric Evaluation of Disability Inventory) Functional Skills Scale. Biomarkers of muscle storage (CK, AST, ALT, and uGlc4) also decreased to nearly normal levels over time [<xref rid=""bb0080"" ref-type=""bibr"">16</xref>,<xref rid=""bb0085"" ref-type=""bibr"">17</xref>]. Our data, although limited to 4 patients, represents the first “real-world” experience in Italy of the use of neoGAA in patients with IOPD. Patients were selected based on their age and the inability to achieve optimal results with rhGAA even if it was administered early and for many years. However, due to the real-world setting, the outcomes reported in our four patients varied, even if our findings suggest a significant positive effect of neoGAA, given that a constant and rapid decrease in biomarkers was observed and motor performances appeared to increase. Even heart involvement, which was stable or worsening over the past years, showed a surprising improvement in case #1. In this patient, the high antibody titer might have been responsible for the poor response to rhGAA. While on neoGAA this benefit was detected in the first months of treatment, suggesting a rapid response to the drug. Moreover, no adverse events were registered in our sample, even in patients who had developed high antibody titers against rhGAA. The need for early diagnosis and treatment of IOPD remains an important issue. In Italy, newborn screening for lysosomal disorders is already active in selected centers and possible expansion in the entire country is under consideration. This would allow identification of patients at birth and prompt, early treatment with neoGAA in the first weeks, through which even better results can be expected. None.",N/A,26 7 2024
Enzyme replacement therapy and immunotherapy lead to significant functional improvement in two children with Pompe disease: a case report,,"Pompe disease, also known as type II glycogenosis or acid maltase deficiency, is a rare autosomal recessive disorder first described by the Dutch pathologist Johannes Pompe in 1932. The incidence of Pompe disease varies between 1/40,000 and 1/400,000 depending on the population and geographical region studied [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR1"">1</xref>, <xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR2"">2</xref>]. The disease is caused by a deficiency in the enzyme acid alpha-glucosidase (GAA), which is encoded by the <italic toggle=""yes"">GAA</italic> gene located on chromosome 17q25.2-q25.3 [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR3"">3</xref>]. Deficiency of GAA results in progressive accumulation of lysosomal glycogen, leading to cellular dysfunction and tissue damage. Pompe disease is a multisystem disorder that can affect individuals of any age and presents with a variety of signs and symptoms, including progressive muscle weakness, hypotonia, delayed motor development, gait disturbance, respiratory distress, cardiomyopathy, and macroglossia. The onset, severity, and progression of symptoms can vary widely between individuals, depending on the age of onset, the extent of the disease, and the level of residual GAA activity in the tissues [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR3"">3</xref>]. Diagnosis of Pompe disease typically involves a thorough evaluation of clinical features, including a complete physical examination and detailed medical history, as well as laboratory and genetic testing. Enzyme assays in isolated lymphocytes or fibroblast cultures can confirm the diagnosis by demonstrating a deficiency in acid alpha-glucosidase activity. In addition, molecular studies of the <italic toggle=""yes"">GAA</italic> gene can identify specific mutations associated with the disease. Accurate and timely diagnosis of Pompe disease is essential for effective management of the disease. With early detection, people with Pompe disease can benefit from treatment strategies such as enzyme replacement therapy, which can improve symptoms, slow disease progression, and prolong survival [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR3"">3</xref>]. Enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) is the only approved treatment for Pompe disease and has been available since the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved recombinant human acid alpha-glucosidase (rhGAA; alglucosidase alfa) in 2006. Administered through biweekly infusions of recombinant human GAA, ERT has been shown to reduce complications and preserve motor, respiratory, and cardiac function in patients with Pompe disease, especially when started early. Despite the benefits of ERT, some patients may develop antibodies to the therapy, leading to reduced efficacy [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR4"">4</xref>]. Therefore, monitoring patients for antibody development and identifying appropriate treatment strategies is critical. In this context, we present a case report of two infants with early-onset Pompe disease (EOPD) who initially failed to respond to ERT and subsequently developed IgG antibodies to the therapy. The patients were treated with methotrexate, and their functional outcome was objectively assessed by motor function testing. This case report highlights the importance of monitoring patients for the development of antibodies to ERT and the need for alternative therapeutic approaches when ERT is no longer effective.  Pompe disease, also known as type II glycogenosis, is a lysosomal storage disorder with a clinical spectrum ranging from the classic infantile form, which is the most severe, to late-onset forms. The advent of enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) with alglucosidase alfa (rhGAA) has dramatically changed the natural history of this disease, significantly improving survival and clinical outcomes [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR5"">5</xref>]. However, the development of anti-rhGAA antibodies remains a major challenge that can compromise both the safety and efficacy of ERT [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR6"">6</xref>]. The cases presented so far illustrate the benefits of ERT and prophylactic immune tolerance induction (ITI) in patients with classical infantile Pompe disease. The results of these cases are consistent with literature reports showing that ERT combined with ITI can improve clinical outcomes and reduce the development of anti-rhGAA antibodies in patients with negative cross-reactive immunological material (CRIM) status [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR5"">5</xref>, <xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR7"">7</xref>, <xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR8"">8</xref>]. Early diagnosis and timely initiation of ERT are critical to achieving optimal motor outcomes in children with Pompe disease. The earlier that treatment is initiated, the greater the likelihood of preventing or reversing irreversible muscle damage [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR8"">8</xref>]. In the cases presented, patients who received ERT and ITI at a younger age, such as patient 1 (3.8 months) and patient 2 (3.0 months), achieved motor milestones such as independent walking, supporting current recommendations to initiate ERT as early as possible [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR9"">9</xref>, <xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR10"">10</xref>]. The impact of ERT on motor, respiratory, and cardiac function in patients with Pompe disease has been well documented in the literature [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR11"">11</xref>]. In the cases presented, significant improvements in motor function were observed, with patients achieving independent ambulation and age-appropriate developmental milestones. In addition, significant reductions in left ventricular mass index (LVMI) have been observed, indicating an improvement in cardiac hypertrophy [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR8"">8</xref>, <xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR9"">9</xref>]. These findings support the benefits of ERT on cardiac and motor function in patients with Pompe disease. The use of methotrexate to control the development of anti-rhGAA antibodies in patients with Pompe disease treated with ERT has been evaluated in preclinical and clinical studies [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR5"">5</xref>]. In the cases presented, methotrexate was used as part of a prophylactic ITI regimen. This strategy was effective in inducing immune tolerance to ESRD in most patients, with 88% of patients maintaining low or negative anti-rhGAA antibody titers [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR10"">10</xref>]. These findings are consistent with literature reports suggesting that methotrexate may be an effective alternative to rituximab in preventing the development of anti-rhGAA antibodies [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR5"">5</xref>, <xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR12"">12</xref>]. Both the presented clinical cases and the reviewed articles have strengths and limitations that should be considered. A major strength is the cohort size and long-term follow-up in some cases, which provides valuable information on the safety and efficacy of ERT and prophylactic ITI [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR8"">8</xref>, <xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR10"">10</xref>]. However, a common limitation is the retrospective design of some studies and the lack of an adequate control group in others. In addition, the heterogeneity of treatment regimens and clinical endpoints evaluated makes direct comparisons between studies difficult. In conclusion, the cases presented and the existing literature highlight the importance of early diagnosis and timely initiation of ERT in patients with classic infantile Pompe disease. ERT in combination with prophylactic ITI with methotrexate has been shown to be effective in improving clinical outcomes, including motor, respiratory, and cardiac function, and in reducing the development of anti-rhGAA antibodies. However, further research is needed to optimize treatment regimens, monitor long-term effects, and address current limitations of ERT, such as the inability to cross the blood–brain barrier and variability in skeletal muscle response. Future prospective studies and controlled clinical trials will be essential to further improve the management and outcomes of patients with Pompe disease.",N/A,18 7 2024
Intracranial vasculopathy: an important organ damage in young adult patients with late-onset Pompe disease,,"Pompe disease, also known as glycogen storage disease type II (OMIM# 232,300), is an autosomal recessive disorder caused by acid alpha-glucosidase (GAA) deficiency leading to excessive glycogen accumulation in lysosomes [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR1"">1</xref>]. The skeletal, cardiac and respiratory muscles are more prone to be affected. Pompe disease has great genetic and clinical heterogeneity. Late-onset Pompe disease (LOPD) is characterized by progressive myopathy and respiratory insufficiency in childhood and adulthood [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR2"">2</xref>]. The central nervous system could also be involved [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR2"">2</xref>, <xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR3"">3</xref>]. Autopsy findings of the cerebral vasculature of individual LOPD patients revealed lysosomal glycogen accumulation in smooth muscle cells of the smaller arteries, arterioles and capillaries [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR4"">4</xref>–<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR7"">7</xref>]. Cerebrovascular disease in LOPD patients has been predominantly reported in case reports [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR8"">8</xref>–<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR10"">10</xref>]. Cerebral hemorrhage, subarachnoid hemorrhage, aneurysm and dilation of vertebrobasilar arteries were most frequently researched [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR8"">8</xref>, <xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR11"">11</xref>–<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR13"">13</xref>]. However, cerebral infarction, artery stenosis and cerebral small vessel disease (CSVD) in LOPD patients have seldom been reported [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR9"">9</xref>, <xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR14"">14</xref>]. Most neuroimaging studies on LOPD patients in the literature were from European countries, with the largest studies including 21 patients [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR3"">3</xref>, <xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR13"">13</xref>, <xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR15"">15</xref>, <xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR16"">16</xref>]. However, only case reports or family studies on cerebral vessel involvement in Asian LOPD patients exist [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR9"">9</xref>, <xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR17"">17</xref>]. Herein, we collected neuroimaging data from Chinese adult LOPD patients at our center and evaluated their cerebrovascular and brain parenchyma abnormalities.   LOPD has a variety of clinical and genetic manifestations. In our group, the c.2238G > C mutation was identified as the most common. We investigated the neuroimaging characteristics of Chinese adult LOPD patients at our center. Most of the patients had progressive proximal muscle weakness and respiratory impairment. Seven patients had stroke. Enzyme assays, muscular histopathology and genetic mutation analysis confirmed the diagnosis. Cerebral arteriopathy and brain parenchyma abnormalities were detected. For the cerebral vasculature in LOPD patients, dolichoectasia of the vertebrobasilar system was most frequently reported in the literature [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR13"">13</xref>, <xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR15"">15</xref>, <xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR24"">24</xref>, <xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR25"">25</xref>]. In general, the incidence of VBD in the general population is 0.06–4.4% [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR16"">16</xref>, <xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR18"">18</xref>]. However, in the study of 18 LOPD patients, Pichiecchio et al. discovered VBD using brain MRA or contrast-enhanced CT in 10 patients and no aneurysm in any of those patients [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR13"">13</xref>]. Similarly, two studies from the same center involving 21 LOPD patients reported VBD in 10 or 11 patients and aneurysm in 2 or 3 patients by brain CTA or MRA, respectively [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR3"">3</xref>, <xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR15"">15</xref>]. In our study, 17/30 patients had VBD, and 7/30 patients had aneurysms, 7/10 of which were located in the posterior circulation. The incidence of aneurysm (23.3%) was much greater than the 3.2% reported in the general population [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR26"">26</xref>]. The mechanism of dilative arteriopathy or aneurysm in LOPD patients is not completely understood. Several autopsy studies have demonstrated that there is an abnormal accumulation of lysosomal glycogen within smooth muscle cells of cerebral arterioles and arteries in LOPD patients [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR4"">4</xref>, <xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR5"">5</xref>, <xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR24"">24</xref>]. Excessive glycogen deposits can cause degeneration and necrosis of cells [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR5"">5</xref>]. This process interferes with the synthesis and construction of the extracellular matrix and reduces the elasticity and integrity of the vessel wall [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR2"">2</xref>, <xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR19"">19</xref>, <xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR24"">24</xref>], which may be correlated with dilative arteriopathy and aneurysm. Additionally, respiratory impairment increases the partial pressure of carbon dioxide in the blood, which may also lead to vasodilation. Compared to the anterior circulation, the posterior circulation has less sympathetic innervation, and the elastic layer is weaker, which predisposes patients to dilation or aneurysm. Aneurysm rupture can result in subarachnoid hemorrhage, intracranial hematoma or microbleeds, all of which are associated with poor prognosis [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR8"">8</xref>, <xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR17"">17</xref>]. In our group, the diameter of the BA was correlated with disease duration but not with age at imaging, which is a finding that is not completely consistent with the findings in the literature [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR13"">13</xref>] and might be due to the younger age at imaging in our patients. Arterial dilation in the anterior circulation was present in 8 of our 30 patients (8/30), including ectasia of the distal ICA in 6 patients and the MCA in 2 patients. Therefore, dilative arteriopathy may be more extensive than expected. Intracranial artery fenestration was found in our 3 LOPD patients (10%), which was slightly greater than the frequency reported in a Chinese cohort study (6.2%) [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR27"">27</xref>]. Fenestration is a rare anatomical variation that occurs during embryo development. Glycogen deposition may increase the vulnerability of the arterial wall, and fenestration may develop into an aneurysm due to hemodynamic stress and vessel wall fragility [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR28"">28</xref>]. As a result, fenestration is more dangerous in LOPD patients than in the general population, and follow-up is necessary [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR15"">15</xref>]. Notably, restrictive arteriopathy was also detected. Cerebral artery stenosis combined with ectasia/aneurysm/fenestration was more common than stenosis alone in our patients. The arterial stenosis involved multiple segments, not only the posterior circulation but also the anterior circulation. This phenomenon has rarely been reported in LOPD patients. Anneser et al. reported stenosis of the MCA and dilatation of the carotid artery and BA in one patient [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR29"">29</xref>]. It was speculated that these abnormalities were related to the increase in arterial stiffness due to glycogen deposits in the artery wall and that the accumulation of these abnormalities was plurifocal and segmental [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR4"">4</xref>]. Destruction of the intracranial arteriole wall initiates the formation of atherosclerotic plaques, which in turn leads to local stenosis or occlusion of the vessel, causing ischemic cerebrovascular disease [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR18"">18</xref>]. Malhotra et al. reported a LOPD patient with initial symptoms of cerebellar and brainstem infarction due to vertebrobasilar artery stenosis, and the patient died of locked-in syndrome eight months later after rapid progression [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR14"">14</xref>]. Arterial stenosis was a significant risk factor for stroke in our study. Hence, cerebral vessel stenosis can occur in adult LOPD patients, often with a poor prognosis. The involvement of arterial stenosis may be more diffuse than previously recognized. A study also showed an increase in aortic wall stiffness in Pompe disease patients [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR30"">30</xref>]. Strokes in LOPD patients have been mainly reported as case reports/series [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR25"">25</xref>]. Seven patients in our study had stroke. Some of our 30 patients underwent neuroimaging examinations after the occurrence of central nervous system symptoms. Hydrocephalus or compressive symptoms in the cranial nerve were absent in our patients. Only 3 of our patients had concomitant hypertension, hyperlipidemia or diabetes mellitus; i.e., cerebrovascular risk factors. It is supposed that the hematoma in the brainstem of one of our patients may be related to the rupture of a small aneurysm. Infarction lesions in the subtentorium appeared in 5 patients, including one patient with PCA territory and anterior circulation involvement; moreover, one patient had infarction lesion in the basal ganglion. The apparent intracranial artery stenosis was responsible for cerebral infarction in some patients. In addition, the infarct may be attributed to dilative arteriopathy, particularly VBD. VBD patients have a high incidence of posterior circulation infarction [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR18"">18</xref>, <xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR31"">31</xref>]. Dilation, tortuosity and/or elongation of the vertebrobasilar artery was followed by hemodynamic changes. Reduced or stagnant blood flow and morphological features of arteries could result in intraluminal thrombosis in situ [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR9"">9</xref>–<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR11"">11</xref>]. An embolus plugging the orifices of the perforating artery, embolus detachment, or hypoperfusion may contribute to cerebral infarction [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR11"">11</xref>, <xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR32"">32</xref>]. To date, data regarding cerebral small vessels in LOPD patients are scarce. Nearly half of our patients (46%) had WMH, which was greater than the 26% of young clinical patients in another study [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR33"">33</xref>]. Moreover, 11 patients with WMHs had coexistent large artery abnormalities. It was speculated that WMHs are caused by ischemia and insufficient cerebral oxygenation in LOPD patients [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR2"">2</xref>, <xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR3"">3</xref>, <xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR15"">15</xref>]. Mellies et al. reported that LOPD patients developed respiratory disorders due to diaphragm weakness and inspiratory and upper respiratory tract muscle involvement, which caused a reduction in the cerebral blood flow and impaired tissue oxygenation [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR34"">34</xref>]. The severity of WMH and the degree of large artery stenosis do not necessarily correlate with each other [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR35"">35</xref>]. Emerging evidence has revealed that VBD or intracranial arterial dolichoectasia are related to small vessel disease [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR20"">20</xref>]. No significant correlation was found between WMH and dilative arteriopathy in our study, possibly because of the small sample size. CSVD contributes to 25% of stroke cases in the general population [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR36"">36</xref>]. However, 6 of the 7 patients with stroke had WMHs in our study. Hence, WMHs should also be considered in LOPD patients. The presence of microbleeds is another brain MRI marker of CSVD. In the case study by Kretzschmar et al., glycogen-filled vacuoles were observed in arteries of different sizes, and hemosiderin was deposited around the vessels, which indicated a disorder of the blood‒brain barrier [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR5"">5</xref>]. Moreover, numerous small aneurysms are also predominantly localized in the cerebellum [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR5"">5</xref>]. SWI is sensitive for detecting intracranial chronic microbleeds, which present as multifocal black dots. In our study, we detected microbleeds in 7 LOPD patients (23.3%), which was higher than the incidence (10%) of microbleeds in 40-year-old or older healthy adults in the literature [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR37"">37</xref>]. The lesions were located mostly in the cerebellum and brainstem, and this distribution was distinct from the distribution in amyloid angiopathy. Hemodynamic changes related to VBD or aneurysm may result in microbleeds in LOPD patients. In young adult patients with stroke and in terms of genetic factors, Fabry disease has been the focus of research, while LOPD has been easily ignored. Our study revealed the complexity and diversity of cerebrovascular involvement in adult LOPD patients. However, our retrospective study has several limitations. The design was a single-center observational study. The sample size was small since the neuroimaging of many of our LOPD patients was absent or performed outside our institution. Two patients had an emergency CT rather than an MRI scan. Not every patient had a control due to failure to complete the MRA examination. We did not include respiratory parameters in our study, for not all of these parameters were acquired at the imaging time. In addition, follow-up neuroimaging and particular effects of enzyme replacement therapy on cerebral arteriopathy were lacking. Hensel et al. recommended that routine follow-up angiography be completed every 5 years in LOPD patients to monitor the dilated arteries [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR38"">38</xref>]. Cerebral artery stenosis and brain parenchyma abnormalities should also be considered. The coexistence of artery dilation or dolichoectasia and stenosis, as well as anterior and posterior circulation involvement, is a feature of arteriopathy in our Chinese adult LOPD patients. In addition to those of the intracranial major arteries, small vessel changes revealed by WMHs and microbleeds also should not be ignored. LOPD should be considered in young adults with cryptogenic stroke. A series of imaging evaluations, including brain MRI, MRA and SWI, is recommended for adult LOPD patients.",N/A,15 7 2024
Precision medicine in action for Pompe disease,,"Glycogen storage disease type II, more often referred to as Pompe disease, is an inherited metabolic disorder caused by deficiency of lysosomal acid α-glucosidase (GAA). The disease primarily affects skeletal and cardiac muscles. Patients are classified as having infantile-onset Pompe disease (IOPD) or late-onset Pompe disease (LOPD) based on the age at which clinical manifestations appear. More than 650 pathogenic variants in the gene encoding GAA have been reported. While the intronic variant c.-32-13T>G is found in approximately 80%–90% of patients with LOPD, most patients carry private variants. Enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) for Pompe disease has markedly improved patient survival, but central nervous system involvement refractory to ERT has been observed in aging patients.<xref rid=""bib1"" ref-type=""bibr""><sup>1</sup></xref> Despite initial improvement after the initiation of ERT, some patients show clinical decline, and muscle involvement is resistant to treatment. Furthermore, the recombinant enzyme used for ERT is immunogenic, and patients who are cross-reactive immune material negative are especially at risk of developing anti-GAA antibodies that result in decreased ERT efficacy or severe immune reactions. The limitations of ERT have driven the development of several preclinical studies and ongoing gene therapy clinical trials for LOPD and IOPD. In preclinical models, gene therapy has been performed <italic toggle=""yes"">in vivo</italic> using adeno-associated virus (AAV) vectors targeting either the affected muscles or the liver as a depot for the production and secretion of GAA.<xref rid=""bib2"" ref-type=""bibr""><sup>2</sup></xref> Muscle-directed delivery of GAA has resulted in long-term expression in muscle cells but requires higher vector dosages. In contrast, the doses needed for liver-directed AAV-based gene therapy are lower, but the efficacy of treatment is shorter if vector administration is performed early in life because of the loss of episomal AAV vector genomes due to cell division. Therefore, strategies based on vector genome integration or genome editing are more attractive for sustained disease correction. Genome editing by CRISPR-Cas9 requires double-strand DNA breaks (DSBs) that lead to undesired consequences, including uncontrolled gene insertions or deletions and chromosomal abnormalities. Base editors are DSB-independent methods that can result in C>T conversions (cytidine base editors) or A>G conversions (adenine base editors [ABEs]). Christensen and colleagues used ABEs in human skin fibroblasts from three patients with IOPD for the correction of three pathogenic nonsense variants in the gene encoding GAA.<xref rid=""bib3"" ref-type=""bibr""><sup>3</sup></xref> The degree of correction of the target variants was up to 96%, which resulted in detectable GAA protein and enzyme activity within the normal range. While the efficiency of the adenine correction in this proof-of-concept <italic toggle=""yes"">in vitro</italic> study is impressive, significant preclinical work still needs to be performed for the clinical development of base editing for Pompe disease therapy. The delivery of the ABE machinery to a large fraction of muscle cells required for correction of Pompe disease is challenging. Because the limited AAV packaging capacity precludes the use of full-length base editors, dual AAVs delivering split ABEs that are reconstituted in the target cells by <italic toggle=""yes"">trans</italic>-splicing inteins are required.<xref rid=""bib4"" ref-type=""bibr""><sup>4</sup></xref> However, in preclinical studies, optimized dual AAVs enabled <italic toggle=""yes"">in vivo</italic> base editing with only 9% efficacy in skeletal muscle.<xref rid=""bib5"" ref-type=""bibr""><sup>5</sup></xref> Although Duchenne muscular dystrophy gene therapy supports the possibility of correcting several muscle cells, there are also risks of life-threatening toxicity related to the high doses of AAV needed to achieve this goal.<xref rid=""bib6"" ref-type=""bibr""><sup>6</sup></xref> Nevertheless, novel muscle-tropic AAV vectors developed by a directed evolution strategy<xref rid=""bib7"" ref-type=""bibr""><sup>7</sup></xref> have the potential to transduce a higher percentage of muscle fibers. In addition to their increased tropism for both skeletal and cardiac muscles, both highly desirable for Pompe disease treatment, these novel AAV vectors show a liver de-targeting effect, a feature that is less attractive for Pompe disease compared to congenital muscle dystrophies. Although the risks for ABE-mediated mutagenesis are expected to be lower than CRISPR-Cas9, ABEs are only needed transiently to provide the machinery for editing, and long-term expression is not desirable. Expression of ABEs might also induce an immune response against corrected cells. Small-molecule switching elements can be used to overcome the problems of long-term ABE expression. Alternatively, lipid nanoparticle (LNP)-mediated delivery of the gRNA and RNA for ABEs is an attractive option for short-term expression. However, LNPs that specifically and efficiently target skeletal muscles, including the diaphragm, which is an important muscle target in Pompe disease, require further development and optimization.<xref rid=""bib8"" ref-type=""bibr""><sup>8</sup></xref> Patients with IOPD under ERT show neurocognitive impairment during the first years of life and slowly progressive cerebral white matter abnormalities. A muscle-specific therapeutic approach is not expected to address this disease complication. Another major practical challenge is the development of mutation-specific ABEs in a disorder with hundreds of different pathogenic variants. Developing humanized mouse models carrying each of the target mutations does not appear to be a practical solution.

","Pompe disease (PD) is a low‐frequency metabolic myopathy stemming from variants in the <italic toggle=""yes"">GAA</italic> gene, resulting in deficient or absent acidic alpha‐glucosidase (GAA) activity, which leads to the accumulation of glycogen within muscular lysosomes (Kishnani, Hwu, et al., <xref rid=""mgg32480-bib-0013"" ref-type=""bibr"">2006</xref>). Overall incidence has been estimated at approximately 1 case per 40,000 individuals. However, this may vary depending on factors such as ethnicity and geographical location (Kishnani, Hwu, et al., <xref rid=""mgg32480-bib-0013"" ref-type=""bibr"">2006</xref>). To date, there are no reliable population‐wide reports on the incidence of PD in the Mexican population. The clinical spectrum of PD is heterogeneous, as it varies depending on the age of onset, organ involvement, and rate of disease progression. In an attempt to classify the disease, two clinical forms have been proposed: (1) infantile‐onset PD (IOPD) and (2) late‐onset PD (LOPD). Both can manifest with either classic or non‐classic symptoms (Dubrovsky et al., <xref rid=""mgg32480-bib-0006"" ref-type=""bibr"">2014</xref>). Patients with classic IOPD typically exhibit a characteristic phenotype of hypotonia and cardiomyopathy, often manifesting within the early months of life. Without prompt initiation of enzyme therapy, mortality occurs before the first year of life (Dubrovsky et al., <xref rid=""mgg32480-bib-0006"" ref-type=""bibr"">2014</xref>). In contrast, LOPD typically begins after 12 months of age, and 95% of patients do not present with cardiac involvement. The clinical presentation is more heterogeneous, characterized by progressive muscle weakness that spans from childhood into adulthood (Barba‐Romero et al., <xref rid=""mgg32480-bib-0002"" ref-type=""bibr"">2012</xref>). However, it is important to emphasize that clinical classification and phenotype are not always clear. The diagnosis of PD is established through GAA enzyme measurement and molecular studies of the <italic toggle=""yes"">GAA</italic> gene (Musumeci & Toscano, <xref rid=""mgg32480-bib-0023"" ref-type=""bibr"">2019</xref>). Phenotype/genotype correlation is crucial for predicting the clinical behavior of the disease (Kroos et al., <xref rid=""mgg32480-bib-0015"" ref-type=""bibr"">2012</xref>). Therefore, we aimed to characterize the clinical features associated with genetic variants of the <italic toggle=""yes"">GAA</italic> gene. Previously, we reported genetic variants in a series of 19 cases of LOPD in Mexico (Grijalva‐Pérez et al., <xref rid=""mgg32480-bib-0009"" ref-type=""bibr"">2018</xref>; Sánchez‐Sánchez, Ávila‐Rejón, et al., <xref rid=""mgg32480-bib-0033"" ref-type=""bibr"">2022</xref>). In this series, we have expanded the phenotypic characterization of these patients and included patients with the IOPD form and pseudodeficiencies within the same population.  Twenty‐nine patients diagnosed with PD or pseudodeficiency across Mexico were included in this study. Figure <xref rid=""mgg32480-fig-0002"" ref-type=""fig"">2</xref> illustrates the geographical distribution of these patients alongside the corresponding genetic variants. The female population predominated in our series, accounting for 22 out of 29 patients (75.8%). Symptom onset ranged from 0.1 to 43 years, encompassing both IOPD and LOPD forms. Among the LOPD subgroup (P1–P19), the median age of symptom onset was 19 years (range: 2–43 years), with a median age of diagnosis of 36 years (range: 9–52 years). Notably, two asymptomatic women (P18, P19) were included in the study, as they were relatives of a patient previously diagnosed with PD. Further evaluation classified both of them as having LOPD. For LOPD, the median time from symptom onset to diagnosis was 16 years, ranging from 2 to 30 years. Clinical and demographic characteristics of the LOPD subgroup are delineated in Table <xref rid=""mgg32480-tbl-0001"" ref-type=""table"">1</xref>. Patients 20 to 26 were infants diagnosed with IOPD, the median age at symptom onset was 3 months (range: 1–9 months) and the median age at diagnosis was 8 months (range: 4–18 months). Among these seven IOPD patients, six (85.7%) had passed away at the time of study due to PD‐related complications, the sole survivor of this cohort is currently undergoing enzyme replacement therapy (ERT). Clinical and demographic details of this subgroup can be found in Table <xref rid=""mgg32480-tbl-0002"" ref-type=""table"">2</xref>. Patients 27 to 29 exhibited typical symptoms and low GAA enzyme activity, suggesting PD. However, the lack of identification of two pathogenic <italic toggle=""yes"">GAA</italic> gene variants suggests a probable pseudodeficiency. The clinical and demographic characteristics of these unconfirmed cases are outlined in Table <xref rid=""mgg32480-tbl-0003"" ref-type=""table"">3</xref>. In summary, 26 patients (P1 to P26) received a diagnosis of PD due to low serum GAA enzyme levels and the presence of two pathogenic variants in the <italic toggle=""yes"">GAA</italic> gene. The remaining patients (P27 to P29) carried <italic toggle=""yes"">cis</italic> variants recognized as pseudodeficiency alleles. Notably, several patients belonged to the same family. Thus, we analyzed 21 families: P4–P6 from family 4 (F4) were siblings, P9–13 from family 7 (F7), and P17–19 from family 11 (F11). Seven of the 29 patients displayed homozygous pathogenic variants and 22 were compound heterozygotes. Details of the variants found in each patient are displayed in Table <xref rid=""mgg32480-tbl-0004"" ref-type=""table"">4</xref>. Regarding the genotype, variants (cDNA level) identified in this case series were as follows: 36 alleles were identified as substitutions (36/58: 62.1%), five were deletions (5/58: 8.6%), two were duplications (2/58: 3.4%), and 15 intronic variants (15/58: 25.9%). Classification of variants according to impact on protein structure identified 29 alleles as missense variants (29/58: 50%), 14 as intronic (14/58: 24.2%), six as nonsense (6/58: 6.9%), seven as frameshift (7/58:12.07%), one as canonical splicing site (1/58: 1.7%), and one as synonymous (1/58:1.7%) variants. The most prevalent variant was c.‐32‐13T>G (<italic toggle=""yes"">rs386834236</italic>), which was identified in 14 alleles of our cohort with all instances occurring in compound heterozygous form. The variant c.2560C>T (p. Arg854Ter, rs121907943) was identified in four alleles, comprising one homozygote (P21) and two compound heterozygous patients (P1 and P3). Additionally, the variant c.1445C>T (p.Pro482Leu, rs2039212985) was detected in three alleles, one homozygote (P2), and one compound heterozygote (P8). Variant c.1987delC (p. Gln663Serfs*33) was detected in three alleles, including one homozygote (P26) and one compound heterozygote (P24). Among the 23 variants identified in the <italic toggle=""yes"">GAA</italic> gene within this cohort, 16 were classified as pathogenic. Regarding the three classified as likely pathogenic, two of them were inherited in <italic toggle=""yes"">cis</italic>, along with the c.2560C>T and c.1726G>A pseudodeficiency allele (P27), whereas the other one was found in a compound heterozygous state, along with variant classified as pathogenic (P24). One variant was classified as a variant of uncertain significance (VUS, P28), and 2 were classified as benign variants associated with pseudodeficiency (P27, P28, P29), as per ACMG criteria (Richards et al., <xref rid=""mgg32480-bib-0032"" ref-type=""bibr"">2015</xref>). The frequency of pseudodeficiency alleles found in this cohort was 3/29 (10.3%). Details of these variants and their predicted impact are displayed in Table <xref rid=""mgg32480-tbl-0005"" ref-type=""table"">5</xref>. PD is a rare metabolic myopathy with a heterogeneous clinical spectrum. In an effort to classify the disease according to clinical presentation, it has been categorized as infantile‐onset (classic and non‐classical) and late‐onset (infantile, juvenile, and adult‐onset) forms (Kroos et al., <xref rid=""mgg32480-bib-0015"" ref-type=""bibr"">2012</xref>). Incidence rates of PD exhibit variability across ethnicities and geographical regions. The overall incidence is estimated to be approximately 1:40,000 (Kishnani, Hwu, et al., <xref rid=""mgg32480-bib-0013"" ref-type=""bibr"">2006</xref>). The most severe form of the disease presents typically in early infancy. Previous reports indicate a median age of onset at 2 months (range: 0–12 months), with diagnosis typically confirmed by 4.7 months, initiation of mechanical ventilation by 5.9 months, and death occurring at 8.7 months (range: 0.3–73.4 months) (Kishnani, Steiner, et al., <xref rid=""mgg32480-bib-0014"" ref-type=""bibr"">2006</xref>). Our findings align with reported data in the IOPD patient subgroup. Patients presenting with LOPD form may exhibit symptom onset ranging from late childhood to early adulthood. Typical symptoms for the diagnosis include proximal and axial muscle weakness, which may involve the diaphragm, leading to respiratory distress. Disease progression and appearance of symptoms are typically slow, insidious, and confusing, often overlapping with other muscle pathologies. Patients suffering from LOPD often experience a significant delay in diagnosis, which usually spans several years (Barba‐Romero et al., <xref rid=""mgg32480-bib-0002"" ref-type=""bibr"">2012</xref>). A survey‐based study conducted in several European countries reported a median time from the onset of the symptoms to diagnosis of 12 years. This delay in diagnosis was attributed to the fact that they were not sent directly to specialized or reference centers for patients with PD due to a lack of knowledge about to whom and where these patients should be referred once PD is suspected (Lagler et al., <xref rid=""mgg32480-bib-0016"" ref-type=""bibr"">2019</xref>). Among the 19 patients diagnosed with LOPD in this series, the average time between symptom onset and diagnosis was 16 years, surpassing previous reports. We suspect this delay in diagnosis may be related to insufficient awareness of the disease. We identified 23 variants in this series, comprising the largest PD series in the Mexican population, which included 29 patients across 21 families, with two novel variants.

This deficiency of GAA, caused by pathogenic variants in the <italic toggle=""yes"">GAA</italic> gene, results in accumulation of lysosomal glycogen, leading to cellular dysfunction, muscle damage and functional disability [<xref rid=""bb0005"" ref-type=""bibr"">1</xref>]. In contrast to infantile-onset Pompe disease (IOPD), patients with the late-onset Pompe disease (LOPD) phenotype experience a more variable disease course and rate of progression [<xref rid=""bb0010"" ref-type=""bibr"">2</xref>]. The progressive muscle damage associated with LOPD causes a decline in respiratory and motor function, associated with substantial morbidity and mortality if inadequately treated [<xref rid=""bb0015"" ref-type=""bibr"">3</xref>]. The treatment landscape for LOPD is changing; until recently, the standard-of-care has been enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) with recombinant human acid α-glucosidase (alglucosidase alfa [ALG]; Lumizyme® in the US, Myozyme® in other regions), which has been available since 2006 [<xref rid=""bb0015"" ref-type=""bibr"">[3]</xref>, <xref rid=""bb0020"" ref-type=""bibr"">[4]</xref>, <xref rid=""bb0025"" ref-type=""bibr"">[5]</xref>]. ERT with ALG improves walking distance, stabilizes respiratory function, and extends invasive ventilator-free survival in children and adults with LOPD [<xref rid=""bb0030"" ref-type=""bibr"">6</xref>,<xref rid=""bb0035"" ref-type=""bibr"">7</xref>]. However, limited targeting of ALG to skeletal muscle impacts its effects, and the overall disease burden in LOPD remains high despite ERT [<xref rid=""bb0040"" ref-type=""bibr"">8</xref>,<xref rid=""bb0045"" ref-type=""bibr"">9</xref>]. This has driven a need for therapies with improved efficacy and long-term effects. Avalglucosidase alfa (AVA) is a next-generation ERT with improved targeting to skeletal muscle and trafficking to lysosomes compared with ALG [<xref rid=""bb0050"" ref-type=""bibr"">10</xref>], which is approved for the treatment of patients with LOPD and/or IOPD in several countries worldwide [<xref rid=""bb0055"" ref-type=""bibr"">11</xref>,<xref rid=""bb0060"" ref-type=""bibr"">12</xref>]. Evidence on the clinical efficacy of AVA in improving respiratory function in LOPD is available from several clinical trials including a Phase 1 open-label trial (NEO1; <ext-link ext-link-type=""ClinicalTrials.gov"" http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink href=""NCT01898364"" id=""ir0045"">NCT01898364</ext-link>) and its open-label extension (Neo-EXT; <ext-link ext-link-type=""ClinicalTrials.gov"" http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink href=""NCT02032524"" id=""ir0050"">NCT02032524</ext-link>) [<xref rid=""bb0065"" ref-type=""bibr"">13</xref>,<xref rid=""bb0070"" ref-type=""bibr"">14</xref>], and the Phase 3 COMET trial (<ext-link ext-link-type=""ClinicalTrials.gov"" http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink href=""NCT02782741"" id=""ir0055"">NCT02782741</ext-link>) that compared the efficacy of AVA with ALG [<xref rid=""bb0075"" ref-type=""bibr"">15</xref>]. In the COMET trial, the difference in change from baseline in upright forced vital capacity percent predicted (FVCpp) for AVA versus ALG was 2.43% (95% confidence interval [CI] -0.13; 4.99), demonstrating non-inferiority (<italic toggle=""yes"">p</italic> <italic toggle=""yes"">=</italic> 0.0074; non-inferiority margin 1.1) and achieving the study's primary objective [<xref rid=""bb0075"" ref-type=""bibr"">15</xref>]. Superiority of AVA versus ALG was narrowly missed (<italic toggle=""yes"">p</italic> = 0.0626), which may have been due to an outlying patient in the AVA arm with low baseline FVC and severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [<xref rid=""bb0075"" ref-type=""bibr"">15</xref>,<xref rid=""bb0080"" ref-type=""bibr"">16</xref>]. This highlights the challenges of clinical trials in rare diseases, in which the sample size is often small. Using pooled data from multiple studies and analyzing common endpoints provides the opportunity to increase the sample size and obtain additional insights into clinical outcomes. Thus, to fully assess the benefit of AVA on FVCpp compared with ALG, a post hoc analysis with a larger sample size was conducted using pooled data from the COMET and NEO1/NEO-EXT trials of AVA and the LOTS trial of ALG [<xref rid=""bb0030"" ref-type=""bibr"">6</xref>].   The objective of this post hoc analysis was to gain more insights into the relative efficacy of AVA versus ALG on FVCpp by constructing regression models of pooled data from three clinical trials to increase precision: COMET, NEO1/NEO-EXT, and LOTS. Four regression models were developed for estimation of the treatment effect on FVCpp. An effect favoring AVA versus ALG was demonstrated at approximately 1 year in all four models, with nominal significance demonstrated in three of the four models (Models 1–3, ranging from 2.27 to 2.80) where the sample size was substantially greater than in the COMET trial, with an estimated effect on FVCpp consistent with the results from the pre-specified COMET regression analyses. Nominally significant improvements with AVA versus ALG were also observed in all four models at Weeks 12–13 and 25–26, in Model 3 at Weeks 37–38, and in Models 1, 2, and 3 at Weeks 49–52. In all analyses, results numerically favored AVA over ALG at each time point, as expected based on the primary results from COMET [<xref rid=""bb0075"" ref-type=""bibr"">15</xref>]. Model 2, which included data from the double-blind randomized trials COMET and LOTS and was based on 608 observations from 157 patients, was considered as providing the most reliable estimates. Other models that included data from the NEO1/NEO-EXT trials (Models 1 and 4) were limited by the small number of treatment-naive patients included from this trial (<italic toggle=""yes"">n</italic> <italic toggle=""yes"">=</italic> 3), therefore, predicted treatment differences should be interpreted with caution. A sensitivity analysis of Model 2 was also conducted (Model 3), which was adjusted for baseline ventilation use. While this model demonstrated a greater effect size estimate than Model 2, this result may have been driven by the exclusion of patients from COMET without baseline data on ventilation use, as demonstrated by an exploratory analysis of Model 2 in which these patients were excluded and the effect size at Weeks 49–52 was in line with Model 3. The results of our analysis are consistent with those of the COMET trial, in which a clinically meaningful improvement in respiratory function at 1 year was observed with AVA over ALG in treatment-naive patients with LOPD [<xref rid=""bb0075"" ref-type=""bibr"">15</xref>]. The relative effect estimated at this time point in COMET was 2.43% (95% CI -0.13; 4.99), which did not reach statistical significance for superiority [<xref rid=""bb0075"" ref-type=""bibr"">15</xref>]. In comparison, in Model 2 the estimated relative effect at 1 year was 2.43% (95% CI 0.21; 4.65), the same as reported in the COMET trial, but with smaller confidence intervals due to the increased sample size in the model. These results support the hypothesis that superiority of AVA over ALG in the original COMET analysis was likely missed due to insufficient sample size in the presence of an outlying patient [<xref rid=""bb0080"" ref-type=""bibr"">16</xref>]. Additional post-hoc non-parametric analyses of FVC in the COMET trial examined the statistical impact of this outlier with low baseline FVC and severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and showed a significant <italic toggle=""yes"">p</italic>-value based on all observed data (<italic toggle=""yes"">p</italic> = 0.019) [<xref rid=""bb0080"" ref-type=""bibr"">16</xref>]. The benefits on upright FVC are of clinical significance because FVC is predictive of respiratory failure and the requirement for invasive ventilation [<xref rid=""bb0100"" ref-type=""bibr"">20</xref>], as well as patient-reported outcomes including health-related quality of life [<xref rid=""bb0105"" ref-type=""bibr"">21</xref>]. Given these points, as well as the progressive nature of LOPD, even stability in respiratory function can be clinically meaningful. Clinical and real-world studies of ALG have shown stabilization or improvements in respiratory function and survival demonstrated over several years [<xref rid=""bb0110"" ref-type=""bibr"">[22]</xref>, <xref rid=""bb0115"" ref-type=""bibr"">[23]</xref>, <xref rid=""bb0120"" ref-type=""bibr"">[24]</xref>]. However, recent data from an observational study of patients receiving ALG with a mean (standard deviation [SD]) follow-up of 7 (3) years demonstrated that initial improvement in FVCpp was followed by a statistically significant deterioration, particularly in those patients with more severe disease at baseline [<xref rid=""bb0125"" ref-type=""bibr"">25</xref>]. Longer-term data on the real-world effectiveness of AVA in LOPD are not yet available, and the potential clinical benefits of enhanced cellular uptake of AVA in skeletal muscle on maintenance of effect requires further investigation. Data from the open-label, extended treatment period of the COMET trial (final data cut-off 31st May 2023) demonstrated that respiratory and motor function were stabilized or improved at Week 145 from baseline, demonstrating the continued benefit of AVA beyond the primary analysis period [<xref rid=""bb0130"" ref-type=""bibr"">26</xref>]. Additionally, available data from an interim analysis of the NEO-EXT trial show stabilization of upright FVCpp over up to 6 years of treatment with AVA in a sample of 10 treatment-naive patients and 14 patients who switched from ALG after ≥9 months treatment [<xref rid=""bb0070"" ref-type=""bibr"">14</xref>]. These results inform our understanding of the longer-term efficacy and safety of AVA in patients with LOPD. Limitations of this analysis include its post hoc nature and the use of pooled data from trials with different designs and different inclusion criteria. For example, included patients from the NEO1/NEO-EXT trials were restricted to those considered to be most comparable with patients from COMET, therefore, study was included as a fixed effect in all regression models in order to capture the residual study effect. All models favored AVA, with significant treatment differences at 1 year in Models 1–3; however, statistical significance was nominal (i.e., exploratory) as these analyses were not pre-specified in the original plan from the trials and were not adjusted for multiple testing. Results that included data from the NEO1/NEO-EXT trials must also be interpreted with caution due to the small number of patients included from these trials. In addition, changes in the standard-of-care for patients with LOPD since the LOTS trial was conducted may have influenced responses in patients treated with AVA in COMET. Finally, no imputation was performed for missing data; however, the proportion of missing covariate data was low in a trial setting and the repeated measures modeling addressed missing outcome data without the need for imputation. Despite these limitations, these pooled data from different clinical trials provide valuable information on the treatment of LOPD, a rare disease with a heterogenous presentation and disease course in which clinical trials are often hampered by small sample sizes. The advent of artificial intelligence may help address some of these issues by aiding in earlier diagnosis and identification of patients [<xref rid=""bb0135"" ref-type=""bibr"">27</xref>]. In the absence of such advances, pooled analyses such as the current analysis can be informative in understanding the value of new medications for rare diseases. In conclusion, results from this pooled analysis of trial data that increases the sample size reinforce the suggested superiority of AVA over ALG on FVCpp. Overall, these data demonstrate that AVA is associated with a more favorable effect on respiratory function at 1 year than ALG in treatment-naive patients with LOPD.

Changes in forced vital capacity over ≤ 13 years among patients with late-onset Pompe disease treated with alglucosidase alfa: new modeling of real-world data from the Pompe Registry,,"The clinical course of respiratory muscle function has been evaluated in several studies of subjects with late-onset Pompe disease (LOPD) during enzyme replacement therapy with alglucosidase alfa [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR1"">1</xref>–<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR3"">3</xref>]. Clinical trials reported a slight increase in forced vital capacity (FVC) over the initial 6 months of alglucosidase alfa treatment [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR2"">2</xref>, <xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR4"">4</xref>]. However, the subsequent evolution of respiratory function remains unclear. While some studies and systematic reviews reported stabilization of lung function for up to 5 years during alglucosidase alfa treatment [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR4"">4</xref>, <xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR5"">5</xref>], other observational reports [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR1"">1</xref>, <xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR6"">6</xref>, <xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR7"">7</xref>] indicated a gradual decline in vital capacity, particularly at timepoints beyond 5 years. The present study analyzes Pompe Registry upright FVC data with more detailed methods in a pediatric and adult cohort over a longer duration to answer three fundamental questions: (1) Do real-world data corroborate an increase in FVC in the first 6 months of alglucosidase alfa treatment? (2) What is the course of FVC over longer time frames from > 6 months to 13 years on treatment? (3) Do longitudinal patterns of FVC differ based on age at diagnosis, baseline FVC, or time from diagnosis to first treatment?   This long-term prospective study examined real-world evidence obtained by the Pompe Registry to define the longitudinal course of respiratory function, as assessed by FVC % predicted, in 485 patients with LOPD over 13 years following treatment initiation with alglucosidase alfa. The current analysis builds on a previous study of FVC [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR5"">5</xref>] during the first 5 years of alglucosidase alfa treatment in pediatric and adult patients. The key new findings of our current study relate to the characterization of respiratory function trajectories during different periods after treatment initiation. We confirmed, using real-world data, that a significant increase in FVC occurs during the first 6 months of treatment, in accordance with findings reported during clinical trials and a systematic review [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR2"">2</xref>–<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR4"">4</xref>]. In addition, we demonstrated a modest decline in respiratory function from > 6 months to 13 years that matches prior clinical observations ﻿[<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR1"">1</xref>, <xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR4"">4</xref>, <xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR6"">6</xref>, <xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR7"">7</xref>, <xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR12"">12</xref>]. The declines in FVC in the periods > 6 months to 5 years and > 5 to 13 years were not significantly different from each other, suggesting that respiratory function does not decline significantly more rapidly with longer duration of treatment. Notably, the rate of FVC decline from > 6 months to 5 years and from 5 to 13 years (−0.54%/year and −1.00%/year, respectively) was generally less steep than prior observations in untreated patients (−1.0 to −4.6%/year) [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR13"">13</xref>–<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR16"">16</xref>]. Lastly, analysis of individual trajectories confirmed that the majority of subjects experience an increase in respiratory function with the initiation of alglucosidase alfa treatment with smaller numbers of patients showing increases beyond the first 6 months. The present study further extends prior observations by assessing whether the evolution of lung function during alglucosidase alfa treatment varies by specific patient characteristics at baseline. Patients with baseline respiratory function in the normal range (baseline FVC > 80% predicted) had a long 5-year period of stability following treatment initiation. In these individuals, an increase in lung function immediately after treatment initiation could not be expected given their baseline normal values, but notably, conservation of their existing respiratory function was observed for several years thereafter. In contrast, patients with the most severe respiratory impairment at baseline (FVC < 55% predicted) had room for improvement and demonstrated the largest increase in lung function during the initial 6 months of treatment. These benefits in the patients severely impaired at baseline persisted over the ensuing 13 years, as evidenced by the subsequent slope of decline being less steep than FVC decline in the natural history of untreated Pompe disease [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR13"">13</xref>–<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR16"">16</xref>]. Lastly, there was a suggestion that patients < 18 years old at baseline (treatment initiation) had a larger initial increase and slower long-term decline than patients aged ≥ 18 years at baseline; however, our power to detect significant differences between age groups was limited due to the small number of patients aged < 18 years at baseline. Taken together, these data demonstrate a benefit of alglucosidase alfa treatment on respiratory function that is evident in all FVC and age cohorts, with differing manifestations for each group. These observations are reported for group mean data within each subgroup discussed above; individual responses may vary. Numerous prior studies have evaluated the evolution of respiratory function in patients with LOPD during treatment with alglucosidase alfa [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR2"">2</xref>–<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR4"">4</xref>, <xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR7"">7</xref>, <xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR9"">9</xref>]. These studies differ with respect to baseline patient characteristics, cohort size, and data analytic techniques. Nevertheless, several studies included techniques to assess for varying lung function slope over time and have demonstrated an initial increase in FVC after treatment initiation in treatment-naïve patients with similar magnitude to the present data [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR2"">2</xref>–<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR4"">4</xref>, <xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR7"">7</xref>, <xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR9"">9</xref>]. Specifically, our observation of a slope of 1.83%/year during the first 6 months of alglucosidase alfa treatment was nearly identical to the previous studies’ estimates ranging from 1.8 to 2.8% predicted over time frames ranging from 2 months to 1 year after treatment initiation. In the present piecewise linear modeling analysis, our use of a pre-defined baseline value for FVC with proximity to the start of treatment maximizes the confidence in our estimates of the initial change in lung function in the 0 to 6-month timeframe. In contrast, slopes for longer-term decline in respiratory function were highly variable between studies. The Late-Onset Pompe Observational Study [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR14"">14</xref>] followed 58 adults for 1 year, finding a mean upright FVC change of −4.6%/year. Whereas, additional studies with durations ranging from 14 months [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR16"">16</xref>] to 16 years [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR13"">13</xref>] reported mean changes in FVC ranging from −1.0 to −1.6%/year. The present study provides information that may help clarify the etiology for the discrepancies in the reported long-term evolution of lung function. We leveraged data collected from the largest longitudinal and multi-national cohort of patients with Pompe disease. Robust analytic techniques were used to define time courses over discrete time frames from initiation of alglucosidase alfa treatment coupled with subgroup analyses, as defined by differing baseline characteristics. Our subgroup analyses confirm that while the evolution of lung function during alglucosidase alfa therapy is generally better than the untreated natural history, variability is noted between patients, which may explain the differences noted in prior studies. Although the estimated evolution of lung function over long time frames varies across studies, all available data agree that the average decline in FVC during alglucosidase alfa treatment is more gradual than the natural history of the disease. Since the need for ventilatory support is tightly linked to the level of respiratory function [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR17"">17</xref>], the relatively more favorable natural history of disease following initiation of alglucosidase alfa treatment would be expected to delay the need for either nocturnal or daytime respiratory support. The strengths of this study include its larger real-world sample compared with any preceding study, follow-up extending beyond 5 years to up to 13 years (other studies of long duration have fewer patients at > 5 years), and separate slope segments estimated for treatment durations beyond 5 years to determine if longer treatment experience affects the rate of change. Limitations may include the characteristics of Registry real-world data, including variation in FVC testing techniques across Pompe Registry sites; varying numbers of data points, irregular testing intervals, and/or incomplete data capture due to the practice-based collection of Registry data, and the absence of a direct untreated comparator group. Finally, we used the mixed modeling approach to estimate individual FVC slopes for each patient to understand the range of individual trajectories, but the data do not provide insight into the factors underlying variability across patients. These results do not take into account a patient’s genotype, antibody status, or other possible effect modifiers. The impacts of lung comorbidities and smoking history could not be evaluated as data were not collected in the Registry. Nevertheless, the present data represent the most comprehensive evaluation of long-term lung function during disease-modifying treatment for LOPD, which can inform evolving observations during newly approved and additional investigational therapies that aim to build on and sustain the initial improvement in FVC observed with alglucosidase alfa treatment [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR18"">18</xref>–<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR22"">22</xref>]. This analysis of long-term real-world FVC data demonstrates a benefit of alglucosidase alfa on respiratory function, which is durable and clinically meaningful in comparison with published data on the untreated natural course of LOPD. At a group level, a beneficial response to alglucosidase alfa persists for at least 13 years after treatment initiation. Modeling FVC over the three periods confirmed that respiratory function increases over the first 6 months of treatment in real-world use of alglucosidase alfa, as has been observed in clinical trials. Importantly, while respiratory function appeared to decline modestly with longer duration of treatment, the longitudinal course was much improved as compared with the published natural history of LOPD. These findings indicate a clear and persistent clinical benefit of alglucosidase alfa treatment, as alteration of the lung function trajectory over time would be expected to delay the need for either nocturnal or daytime respiratory support. Nevertheless, an unmet need persists since most individuals demonstrate a decline in lung function 5 years after initiating treatment, which may be addressed by future therapies. ",N/A,19 6 2024
"Start, switch and stop (triple‐S) criteria for enzyme replacement therapy of late‐onset Pompe disease: European Pompe Consortium recommendation update 2024",,"Pompe disease, or glycogen storage disorder type II, is an inherited autosomal recessive multisystemic metabolic disorder caused by a deficiency of the lysosomal enzyme acid alpha‐glucosidase, resulting from disease‐associated sequence variations in the alpha‐glucosidase gene (GAA gene) of which more than 500 have been identified (<ext-link http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink href=""http://www.pompe.variantdatabase.nl"" ext-link-type=""uri"">www.pompe.variantdatabase.nl</ext-link>) to date. Pompe disease presents a spectrum of phenotypes, ranging from a rapidly fatal phenotype in infants (classic infantile Pompe disease) to more slowly progressive forms in older children and adults (late‐onset Pompe disease), in whom skeletal and respiratory muscles are mainly affected [<xref rid=""ene16383-bib-0001"" ref-type=""bibr"">1</xref>]. The European Pompe Consortium (EPOC), founded in September 2014 [<xref rid=""ene16383-bib-0002"" ref-type=""bibr"">2</xref>, <xref rid=""ene16383-bib-0003"" ref-type=""bibr"">3</xref>], published its first recommendation on the start and stop criteria for enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) for late‐onset Pompe disease in this journal in 2017 [<xref rid=""ene16383-bib-0001"" ref-type=""bibr"">1</xref>]. Since then, two novel ERTs for late‐onset Pompe disease have been clinically evaluated in phase 3 trials and the first long‐term studies. Both novel ERTs reached marketing authorization by the European Medicines Agency and in several parts of the world in 2022 and 2023, respectively [<xref rid=""ene16383-bib-0004"" ref-type=""bibr"">4</xref>, <xref rid=""ene16383-bib-0005"" ref-type=""bibr"">5</xref>, <xref rid=""ene16383-bib-0006"" ref-type=""bibr"">6</xref>, <xref rid=""ene16383-bib-0007"" ref-type=""bibr"">7</xref>, <xref rid=""ene16383-bib-0008"" ref-type=""bibr"">8</xref>]. The 2017 EPOC recommendation was focused on the only licensed and worldwide available recombinant enzyme alglucosidase alfa [<xref rid=""ene16383-bib-0009"" ref-type=""bibr"">9</xref>]. It did not include switching criteria between products, as several new drugs were at the early stages of clinical investigation. At present/now, data from the recent phase 3 trials (COMET and PROPEL) [<xref rid=""ene16383-bib-0004"" ref-type=""bibr"">4</xref>, <xref rid=""ene16383-bib-0007"" ref-type=""bibr"">7</xref>] and the first long‐term data [<xref rid=""ene16383-bib-0005"" ref-type=""bibr"">5</xref>, <xref rid=""ene16383-bib-0006"" ref-type=""bibr"">6</xref>] are available, but it is still necessary to obtain real‐world, long‐term data for a final shared decision on switching therapy. A further relevant element for the patients living with Pompe disease for the newly licensed therapies is the option of home infusion treatment. Therefore, EPOC decided to update its 2017 recommendation, expand the scope to switching patients, and reconsider start, switch and stop criteria (triple‐S criteria) for enzyme replacement therapy of adult patients with Pompe disease. A consensus technique was adopted using the collective opinion of all EPOC panel members. Our structured method of developing consensus among the 25 expert panel members with long‐standing knowledge of diagnosing and treating Pompe disease from eight European countries started with an in‐person meeting in Rotterdam, the Netherlands, on 26–27 June 2023. This in‐person meeting was followed by three structured rounds of email editing and voting of all 25 panellists. A 100% consensus was reached on all criteria regarding diagnosis, starting, switching and stopping enzyme replacement therapy and monitoring in the real‐world setting in late‐onset Pompe disease. Our consensus was solely based on all publicly available clinical phase 2 and phase 3 ERT trial data and their extensions.  This updated recommendation of ERT for persons living with late‐onset Pompe disease clarified the diagnostic criteria, included the value of muscle MRI as a supportive paraclinical finding for a treatment decision [<xref rid=""ene16383-bib-0011"" ref-type=""bibr"">11</xref>], and added home infusion therapy [<xref rid=""ene16383-bib-0013"" ref-type=""bibr"">13</xref>]. Switching treatment can be considered if there is no indication that skeletal muscle and/or respiratory function have stabilized or improved during a minimum standard ERT treatment period of 12 months. Another reason for switching is if the patient suffers from severe infusion‐associated reactions that cannot be adequately managed. However, for both issues, more scientific evidence must be gathered to determine whether switching is favorable and/or which enzyme treatment is preferable. Possible switching should, therefore, be discussed on a patient‐by‐patient shared‐decision basis. If a patient is switched to a new ERT treatment, careful 6‐monthly monitoring with the advised EPOC assessments (see Figure <xref rid=""ene16383-fig-0001"" ref-type=""fig"">1</xref>) and a treatment period of at least 12 months is recommended. Finally, stopping ERT treatment should be considered for patients suffering from severe infusion‐associated reactions that cannot be adequately managed, for whom switching does not seem appropriate, or who have already switched. It is also recommended to investigate high‐neutralizing antidrug antibody titers. The cut‐off definition of high antibody levels is proposed as 1:30,000–1:56,000 (assay dependent) [<xref rid=""ene16383-bib-0012"" ref-type=""bibr"">12</xref>]. Concurrence of the presence of high titer neutralizing antibodies and a diminution of the effect of ERT can be a reason to stop ERT. Finally, if there is no stabilization or improvement in skeletal muscle and/or respiratory function during the first 2 years after starting or switching treatment, it is recommended to stop the ERT [<xref rid=""ene16383-bib-0014"" ref-type=""bibr"">14</xref>, <xref rid=""ene16383-bib-0015"" ref-type=""bibr"">15</xref>]. However, if, after stopping treatment, the disease deteriorates faster than during treatment, restarting ERT can still be considered. Therefore, regular 6‐monthly assessments using the EPOC assessments are strongly recommended. In conclusion, the new EPOC triple‐S criteria recommendation tries to provide physicians and persons living with Pompe disease guidance on starting, switching and stopping ERT for late‐onset Pompe disease.

Base editing rescues acid α-glucosidase function in infantile-onset Pompe disease patient-derived cells,"Infantile-onset Pompe disease (IOPD) results from pathogenic variants in the <italic toggle=""yes"">GAA</italic> gene, which encodes acid α-glucosidase. The correction of pathogenic variants through genome editing may be a valuable one-time therapy for PD and improve upon the current standard of care. We performed adenine base editing in human dermal fibroblasts harboring three transition nonsense variants, c.2227C>T (p.Q743∗; IOPD-1), c.2560C>T (p.R854∗; IOPD-2), and c.2608C>T (p.R870∗; IOPD-3). Up to 96% adenine deamination of target variants was observed, with minimal editing across >50 off-target sites. Post-base editing, expressed GAA protein was up to 0.66-fold normal (unaffected fibroblasts), an improvement over affected fibroblasts wherein GAA was undetectable. GAA enzyme activity was between 81.91 ± 13.51 and 129.98 ± 9.33 units/mg protein at 28 days post-transfection, which falls within the normal range (50–200 units/mg protein). LAMP2 protein was significantly decreased in the most robustly edited cell line, IOPD-3, indicating reduced lysosomal burden. Taken together, the findings reported herein demonstrate that base editing results in efficacious adenine deamination, restoration of GAA expression and activity, and reduction in lysosomal burden in the most robustly edited cells. Future work will assess base editing outcomes and the impact on Pompe pathology in two mouse models, <italic toggle=""yes"">Gaa</italic><sup>c.2227C>T</sup> and <italic toggle=""yes"">Gaa</italic><sup>c.2560C>T</sup>.  Wang and colleagues demonstrate the correction of three pathogenic variants in dermal fibroblasts derived from patients with infantile-onset Pompe disease using adenine base editing. Editing efficiencies of up to 96% were measured with minimal off-target editing, resulting in the expression of functional GAA with enzyme activity within an expected normal range.","Pompe disease (PD; OMIM: #<ext-link ext-link-type=""omim"" http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink href=""232300"" id=""intref0010"">232300</ext-link>) is an inherited metabolic disorder that presents primarily as skeletal and cardiac myopathy but also manifests neurologically.<xref rid=""bib1"" ref-type=""bibr""><sup>1</sup></xref> Untreated patients with the most severe form, infantile-onset PD (IOPD), die in infancy from cardiorespiratory failure, respiratory muscle weakness, and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.

We herein report the first base editing of genetic variants causative for PD. In this study, we demonstrate efficient ABE of three IOPD variants (c.2227C>T, c.2560C>T, and c.2608C>T) in HDFs, achieving up to 96% editing of the c.2227C>T variant in the IOPD-1 heterozygous cell line and 67% editing in a c.2608C>T homozygous cell line (IOPD-3). Target variant base editing led to restoration of enzyme activity, measured as 118.46 ± 7.12 (<italic toggle=""yes"">p</italic> < 0.0001), 81.91 ± 13.51 (<italic toggle=""yes"">p</italic> = 0.0011), and 129.98 ± 9.33 (<italic toggle=""yes"">p</italic> < 0.0001) units/mg protein for IOPD-1, -2, and -3, respectively, at 28 days post-transfection, rates comparable to what is measured in unaffected HDFs. Normalization of LAMP2 was observed in the most robustly edited cell line (IOPD-3), indicating a reduction in lysosomal burden. We chose these three variants due to their presence in accessible patient-derived cells, their targetability by ABEs, and, in the case of c.2560C>T, the frequency of this variant in the IOPD patient population. Although c.2227C>T has been reported only once, c.2560C>T and c.2608C>T have 77 and 10 associated patients, respectively, reported in the PD <italic toggle=""yes"">GAA</italic> variant database as of 2021.<xref rid=""bib2"" ref-type=""bibr""><sup>2</sup></xref> Given that there are hundreds of variants known to cause IOPD and that patient-specific SNVs within the protospacer-targeting region can hinder editing efficiency (<xref rid=""mmc1"" ref-type=""supplementary-material"">Figure S3</xref>), designing and assessing personalized genome editing strategies may prove challenging. Alternative variant-indiscriminate strategies that employ next-generation genome editing approaches, such as twin prime editing,<xref rid=""bib18"" ref-type=""bibr""><sup>18</sup></xref> should also be explored to encompass the wide range of PD-causing <italic toggle=""yes"">GAA</italic> variants. Interestingly, we observed increased editing efficiency over time. Given that the half-life of plasmid DNA in mammalian cells is approximately 20 h, and plasmid DNA has been found to persist for at least 6 days post-transfection, target alleles may undergo editing beyond the initial 4 day time point.<xref rid=""bib39"" ref-type=""bibr""><sup>41</sup></xref> This finding may also be indicative of a selective advantage for cells expressing functional GAA enzyme <italic toggle=""yes"">in vitro</italic>, but further investigation is necessary to determine the mechanism underlying the observed increases in overall editing efficiency and GAA enzyme activity over time. Additionally, even though considerable base editing is measured by deep sequencing at 4 days post-transfection, GAA activity is ≤25% of normal rates (<xref rid=""fig2"" ref-type=""fig"">Figures 2</xref>D and <xref rid=""fig3"" ref-type=""fig"">3</xref>A). Rates of GAA activity that fall within the normal range are later observed at 14 (IOPD-1 and -3) or 28 days (IOPD-2) and are maintained within this normal range long term (6–12 passages post-base editing; <xref rid=""fig3"" ref-type=""fig"">Figures 3</xref>A and <xref rid=""mmc1"" ref-type=""supplementary-material"">S2</xref>). GAA protein expression post-base editing was measured as 0.52-, 0.31-, and 0.66-fold normal (unaffected HDFs) for IOPD-1, -2, and -3, respectively, correlating with editing efficiencies (<xref rid=""fig3"" ref-type=""fig"">Figure 3</xref>B). To evaluate the intracellular location of GAA post-base editing, we digested GAA with Endo H, a specific endoglycosidase that cleaves mannose-rich oligosaccharides and is used to monitor intracellular trafficking indirectly.<xref rid=""bib40"" ref-type=""bibr""><sup>42</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid=""bib41"" ref-type=""bibr""><sup>43</sup></xref> This assay revealed the same pattern of Endo H-sensitive and -resistant banding for GAA derived from unaffected and ABE-treated IOPD-1 fibroblasts, providing evidence of normal glycosylation and intracellular localization of GAA (<xref rid=""mmc1"" ref-type=""supplementary-material"">Figure S4</xref>). The work of others has shown that, with ERT, rhGAA becomes trapped in the endocytic pathway and/or is mis-trafficked due to the existing autophagic impairments within murine muscle fibers.<xref rid=""bib42"" ref-type=""bibr""><sup>44</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid=""bib43"" ref-type=""bibr""><sup>45</sup></xref> Future studies are imperative to further interrogate the intracellular location of GAA post-base editing. In a recent study, co-therapy of ERT with 1,3-butanediol, a ketone precursor, and an antioxidant cocktail led to the greater attenuation of muscle pathology in <italic toggle=""yes"">Gaa</italic> knockout mice than ERT alone.<xref rid=""bib44"" ref-type=""bibr""><sup>46</sup></xref> If cellular impairments are found to exist post-base editing, then co-treatment with similar compounds may also contribute to a reduction in PD pathology by mitigating autophagic dysfunction and will be explored in murine models of IOPD (<italic toggle=""yes"">Gaa</italic><sup>c.2227C>T</sup> and <italic toggle=""yes"">Gaa</italic><sup>c.2560C>T</sup>). Although we show that GAA produced in ABE-treated HDFs is effective at catabolizing an artificial substrate, we do not report biochemical measurements of the natural substrate, glycogen. Although skeletal and cardiac muscle accumulate glycogen in PD, which is rescued after ERT,<xref rid=""bib14"" ref-type=""bibr""><sup>14</sup></xref> we found glycogen measurements to be inconclusive and unreproducible in fibroblasts. We performed PAS staining in HDFs with or without ABE treatment, as well as in an unaffected HDF cell line, and did not observe differences in PAS-positive polysaccharide inclusions across the cell lines or treatment conditions, providing further evidence that fibroblasts do not store appreciable amounts of glycogen (<xref rid=""mmc1"" ref-type=""supplementary-material"">Figure S6</xref>). Glycogen levels were not assessed under glucose starvation or a regulated nutrient replenishment schedule, which, in addition to fibroblasts not being a primary store for glycogen, may contribute to challenges in reliably and reproducibly detecting glycogen. Furthermore, despite GAA enzyme activity measured within the normal range for all three ABE-treated cell lines, we observed a reduction in LAMP2 expression only in IOPD-3, the most efficiently edited cells. Future assessments of glycogen and LAMP2 levels in induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes and murine myocytes post-ABE will be informative. Finally, the impact of off-target editing was explored using both <italic toggle=""yes"">in silico</italic> (Cas-OFFinder and Hsu off-target scores) and <italic toggle=""yes"">in vitro</italic> (CIRCLE-seq) analyses, followed by targeted amplicon deep sequencing to identify bona fide off-target sites (<xref rid=""fig4"" ref-type=""fig"">Figure 4</xref>). Although more than 50 sites were assessed, only two sites, both in ABE-treated IOPD-3 cells, were found to have significant adenine deamination across the protospacer-targeting region. The impact on gene expression or function is not expected, since adenine deamination is intronic at these sites and does not span predicted splice or branchpoint sites at either off-target site. In conclusion, this study demonstrates efficient ABE of IOPD-causing variants <italic toggle=""yes"">in vitro</italic>, leading to the production of functional GAA and, in the most robustly edited cells, evidence of reduced lysosomal burden. Assessing the efficacy of and optimal delivery methods for genome editing-based therapeutics in murine models of IOPD is necessary. Immunogenicity to GAA is an expected hurdle for <italic toggle=""yes"">in vivo</italic> translation given that substantial antibody titers are produced in CRIM-negative patients in response to ERT.<xref rid=""bib7"" ref-type=""bibr""><sup>7</sup></xref> The existence of split-intein ABEs<xref rid=""bib45"" ref-type=""bibr""><sup>47</sup></xref> qualifies myotropic AAVs, such as AAVMYO<xref rid=""bib46"" ref-type=""bibr""><sup>48</sup></xref> or MyoAAV,<xref rid=""bib47"" ref-type=""bibr""><sup>49</sup></xref> as delivery approaches that may reduce possible immunogenicity to AAV, GAA, and ABE. Given these myotropic vectors specifically and effectively transduce skeletal muscle at far lower doses than AAV9, enhanced <italic toggle=""yes"">GAA</italic> correction in muscle with minimal off-target consequences in other tissues may be achieved. Additionally, temporal control of ABE expression through small-molecule drug-controlled switch elements<xref rid=""bib25"" ref-type=""bibr""><sup>25</sup></xref> could further limit immunogenicity to editing machinery. Given that current therapeutic options for patients with IOPD are limited, the translation of these ABE strategies to patients may offer an efficacious, long-term therapy, and their safety and feasibility will be explored going forward. Future work will focus on the optimization of cassettes expressing ABE and sgRNA under a muscle-specific promoter, with a focus on temporal expression of ABE for minimal toxicity in mouse models harboring the variants targeted in this study (<italic toggle=""yes"">Gaa</italic><sup>c.2227C>T</sup> and <italic toggle=""yes"">Gaa</italic><sup>c.2560C>T</sup>).

Failure of Autophagy in Pompe Disease,"Autophagy is an evolutionarily conserved lysosome-dependent degradation of cytoplasmic constituents. The system operates as a critical cellular pro-survival mechanism in response to nutrient deprivation and a variety of stress conditions. On top of that, autophagy is involved in maintaining cellular homeostasis through selective elimination of worn-out or damaged proteins and organelles. The autophagic pathway is largely responsible for the delivery of cytosolic glycogen to the lysosome where it is degraded to glucose via acid α-glucosidase. Although the physiological role of lysosomal glycogenolysis is not fully understood, its significance is highlighted by the manifestations of Pompe disease, which is caused by a deficiency of this lysosomal enzyme. Pompe disease is a severe lysosomal glycogen storage disorder that affects skeletal and cardiac muscles most. In this review, we discuss the basics of autophagy and describe its involvement in the pathogenesis of muscle damage in Pompe disease. Finally, we outline how autophagic pathology in the diseased muscles can be used as a tool to fast track the efficacy of therapeutic interventions.","The term “autophagy” was introduced in the 1960s by Christian de Duve who had discovered the lysosome and proposed an entirely new concept of the lysosome as a degradative organelle [<xref rid=""B1-biomolecules-14-00573"" ref-type=""bibr"">1</xref>]. The term (literally meaning “self-eating”) was adopted to highlight the difference between the lysosomal delivery of intracellular components from the materials that are taken up from extracellular space—which de Duve called “heterophagy” (endocytic pathway). The field of autophagy research remained dormant for three decades and relied largely on morphological studies until the discovery of autophagy-related genes and the core molecular machinery involved in the process [<xref rid=""B2-biomolecules-14-00573"" ref-type=""bibr"">2</xref>]. Since the 1990s, the field has literally exploded and became one of the most studied areas in biomedical science with an ever-expanding number of publications. Three morphologically distinct types of autophagy, all of which involve the delivery of cytoplasmic materials into the lysosomal lumen for degradation and recycling, are recognized in mammalian cells—macroautophagy, chaperone-mediated autophagy (CMA), and microautophagy. The most studied type, macroautophagy (commonly referred to as autophagy), is unique among the three types in that it involves the de novo formation of a transient double membrane vesicle, the autophagosome. The process starts with the appearance of a cup-shaped membrane structure, called the phagophore [<xref rid=""B3-biomolecules-14-00573"" ref-type=""bibr"">3</xref>], which surrounds a portion of cytoplasm, expands, and closes to form a double-membrane autophagosome. Autophagosomes fuse with early/late endosome-forming amphisomes [<xref rid=""B4-biomolecules-14-00573"" ref-type=""bibr"">4</xref>] or with lysosomes forming autolysosomes, where the inner membrane and the sequestered cargos are broken down by lysosomal hydrolases. The products of lysosomal degradation—amino acids, monosaccharides, free fatty acids, and other building blocks—are transported to the cytoplasm and reused in a variety of biosynthetic processes, as reviewed in [<xref rid=""B5-biomolecules-14-00573"" ref-type=""bibr"">5</xref>,<xref rid=""B6-biomolecules-14-00573"" ref-type=""bibr"">6</xref>]. The autophagic process culminates with the reformation of fully mature functional lysosomes [<xref rid=""B7-biomolecules-14-00573"" ref-type=""bibr"">7</xref>]. In CMA, a subset of soluble cytosolic proteins carrying the KFERQ-like motif bind to a chaperone (the heat shock protein Hsc70) which delivers the substrate protein to the lysosomal surface where the protein–chaperone complex interacts with its receptor, the lysosome-associated membrane protein type 2A (LAMP-2A); this step is followed by protein unfolding and translocation of the substrate into the lysosome, a process mediated by a luminal form of Hsc70 [<xref rid=""B8-biomolecules-14-00573"" ref-type=""bibr"">8</xref>]. Microautophagy—a process which was originally defined as the direct incorporation of cytoplasmic contents into the lysosomal lumen—received much less attention. However, recent studies re-defined the process to include lysosomal/endosomal membrane protrusion and invagination, thus giving rise to the emerging conceptual framework of microautophagy as “a unified form of membrane dynamics” [<xref rid=""B9-biomolecules-14-00573"" ref-type=""bibr"">9</xref>,<xref rid=""B10-biomolecules-14-00573"" ref-type=""bibr"">10</xref>]. In this review, we will focus on macroautophagy, since this type of autophagic process is impaired in Pompe disease, as well as in many other lysosomal storage disorders [<xref rid=""B11-biomolecules-14-00573"" ref-type=""bibr"">11</xref>,<xref rid=""B12-biomolecules-14-00573"" ref-type=""bibr"">12</xref>,<xref rid=""B13-biomolecules-14-00573"" ref-type=""bibr"">13</xref>]. Macroautophagy (thereafter referred to as autophagy) was originally defined as a cellular survival mechanism under starvation; nutrient-starved cells respond by utilizing their own resources to provide amino acids for protein synthesis and energy production. Starvation triggers an acute autophagic response, and it is considered a nonselective (bulk) degradation process by which random cytosolic components are engulfed into autophagosomes. During autophagy, a cytosolic pool of ubiquitous microtubule-associated protein light chain 3 (LC3-I) is conjugated to phosphatidylethanolamine to form LC3-II, which is recruited to autophagosomal membranes and remains there all the way until autophagosomes fuse with lysosomes forming autolysosomes. The two LC3 forms can be easily detected with immunoblotting, thus providing a reliable method for monitoring lysosomal turnover of LC3-II, the marker of autophagosomes [<xref rid=""B14-biomolecules-14-00573"" ref-type=""bibr"">14</xref>,<xref rid=""B15-biomolecules-14-00573"" ref-type=""bibr"">15</xref>]. Apart from the cellular response to starvation, autophagy is also recognized as a highly selective cellular clearance pathway, by which damaged or worn-out organelles, aberrant protein aggregates, and pathogens are removed, thus contributing to cellular quality control [<xref rid=""B16-biomolecules-14-00573"" ref-type=""bibr"">16</xref>,<xref rid=""B17-biomolecules-14-00573"" ref-type=""bibr"">17</xref>]. Unlike nonselective autophagy, selective autophagy relies on various receptor proteins that recognize the specific cargo and engage autophagic machinery to direct the cargo for degradation. The mammalian polyubiquitin-binding protein p62/SQSTM1, a classical selective autophagy receptor, mediates the degradation of ubiquitinated protein aggregates through direct interaction with LC3 located on the isolation membrane/phagophore [<xref rid=""B18-biomolecules-14-00573"" ref-type=""bibr"">18</xref>,<xref rid=""B19-biomolecules-14-00573"" ref-type=""bibr"">19</xref>]. In addition to p62/SQSTM1, multiple other autophagy receptors, also called adaptors, have been identified [<xref rid=""B20-biomolecules-14-00573"" ref-type=""bibr"">20</xref>]. Based on the type of cargo, such as, for example, aggregated proteins, invading bacteria, or damaged organelles, selective autophagy has been classified as aggrephagy, xenophagy, mitophagy, ER-phagy, ribophagy, etc. Of note, damaged lysosomes can also be eliminated via the autophagic pathway. Years ago, while analyzing LC3/LAMP1 (Lysosome-associated membrane protein 1)-immunostained muscle fibers from patients with Pompe disease, we often observed misshapen lysosomes within the autophagosomes and suggested the term “lysophagy” to describe autophagic elimination of damaged lysosomes [<xref rid=""B21-biomolecules-14-00573"" ref-type=""bibr"">21</xref>]. The molecular mechanism of this type of selective autophagy has gained great interest, and a recent study demonstrated that in both HeLa cells and neurons, p62/SQSTM1 is recruited to damaged lysosomes and serves as a lysophagy adaptor in a process regulated by the small heat shock protein HSP27 [<xref rid=""B22-biomolecules-14-00573"" ref-type=""bibr"">22</xref>]. Over a decade ago, the landmark discovery of transcription factor EB (TFEB) represented a major turning point in the lysosomal field: multiple genes encoding lysosomal enzymes and lysosomal membrane proteins were shown to be coordinately transcribed and regulated by TFEB which binds to a palindromic 10 bp motif (called the coordinated lysosomal expression and regulation motif; CLEAR) in their promoters [<xref rid=""B23-biomolecules-14-00573"" ref-type=""bibr"">23</xref>]. Later on, a closely related transcription factor E3 (TFE3), that belongs to the same MiT-TFE family of basic helix–loop–helix leucine-zipper transcription factors, was shown to have a similar effect [<xref rid=""B24-biomolecules-14-00573"" ref-type=""bibr"">24</xref>]. Furthermore, these two transcription factors drive expression of genes involved in both lysosomal and autophagosomal biogenesis and promote autophagosome–lysosome fusion and lysosomal exocytosis [<xref rid=""B24-biomolecules-14-00573"" ref-type=""bibr"">24</xref>,<xref rid=""B25-biomolecules-14-00573"" ref-type=""bibr"">25</xref>,<xref rid=""B26-biomolecules-14-00573"" ref-type=""bibr"">26</xref>]. The importance of these findings can hardly be overestimated; most notably, lysosomes are not just the recipients of autophagic cargos but, rather, are active participants in the autophagic process. Coordinated regulation of lysosomal–autophagosomal biogenesis makes perfect sense—during starvation, the expansion of autophagosomes should be matched with an expansion of lysosomes to enable complete degradation of autophagic cargo. TFEB and TEF3 shuttle between the cytosolic surface of lysosomes and the nucleus depending on their phosphorylation state. When phosphorylated, TFEB and TFE3 remain inactive in the cytosol, but under starvation or other stress conditions, they are dephosphorylated and translocated to the nucleus, thereby inducing the expression of multiple autophagy- and lysosome-related genes (for review, [<xref rid=""B27-biomolecules-14-00573"" ref-type=""bibr"">27</xref>]). The mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1), a master regulator of cell growth, is a major kinase responsible for TFEB and TFE3 phosphorylation [<xref rid=""B28-biomolecules-14-00573"" ref-type=""bibr"">28</xref>,<xref rid=""B29-biomolecules-14-00573"" ref-type=""bibr"">29</xref>]. Inhibition of mTORC1 under nutrient-poor conditions, coupled with lysosomal Ca<sup>2+</sup> release through mucolipin 1 (MCOLN1), activates a calcium-dependent phosphatase, calcineurin, which dephosphorylates TFEB/TFE3 and promotes their nuclear translocation and the induction of lysosomal and autophagic genes [<xref rid=""B30-biomolecules-14-00573"" ref-type=""bibr"">30</xref>] (reviewed in [<xref rid=""B31-biomolecules-14-00573"" ref-type=""bibr"">31</xref>,<xref rid=""B32-biomolecules-14-00573"" ref-type=""bibr"">32</xref>]).  In mammalian cells, the initiation of autophagy depends on the activation of ULK1 (unc-51 like autophagy activating kinase 1)—one of the most upstream proteins of the core autophagy machinery [<xref rid=""B33-biomolecules-14-00573"" ref-type=""bibr"">33</xref>]. The activity of the ULK1 complex is tightly regulated by the opposing effect of mTORC1 and a key energy sensor, AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK). AMPK directly stimulates autophagy via phosphorylation of ULK1 (at Ser 317 and Ser 777), whereas mTORC1 inhibits autophagy by phosphorylating ULK1 at different sites, thus preventing the AMPK–ULK1 interaction [<xref rid=""B34-biomolecules-14-00573"" ref-type=""bibr"">34</xref>,<xref rid=""B35-biomolecules-14-00573"" ref-type=""bibr"">35</xref>]. Furthermore, AMPK promotes autophagy indirectly by inhibiting mTORC1 at the lysosomal surface via the TSC2/Rheb axis (tuberous sclerosis complex/Ras homolog enriched in brain); AMPK-mediated activation of TSC2<sup>S1387</sup> inhibits Rheb, a resident on the cytoplasmic surface of the lysosome and the master activator of mTORC1 [<xref rid=""B35-biomolecules-14-00573"" ref-type=""bibr"">35</xref>,<xref rid=""B36-biomolecules-14-00573"" ref-type=""bibr"">36</xref>,<xref rid=""B37-biomolecules-14-00573"" ref-type=""bibr"">37</xref>,<xref rid=""B38-biomolecules-14-00573"" ref-type=""bibr"">38</xref>]. Starvation inhibits mTORC1, thus initiating autophagy and triggering a transcriptional program required for lysosomal biogenesis (<xref rid=""biomolecules-14-00573-f001"" ref-type=""fig"">Figure 1</xref>).  Perhaps central to the multiple levels of crosstalk between AMPK and mTORC1 and their opposing effects is that both are activated at the cytosolic surface of the lysosome, which serves as a signaling platform to regulate the balance between catabolic and anabolic processes in the cell [<xref rid=""B31-biomolecules-14-00573"" ref-type=""bibr"">31</xref>,<xref rid=""B39-biomolecules-14-00573"" ref-type=""bibr"">39</xref>,<xref rid=""B40-biomolecules-14-00573"" ref-type=""bibr"">40</xref>]. Thus, our understanding of the role of lysosomes has thoroughly changed: what once was viewed as a simple degradative organelle, lysosomes have emerged as a dynamic control center for cellular metabolism [<xref rid=""B31-biomolecules-14-00573"" ref-type=""bibr"">31</xref>,<xref rid=""B41-biomolecules-14-00573"" ref-type=""bibr"">41</xref>]. The lysosome is well-positioned to survey the cellular nutrient and energy levels and initiate the signaling pathways, thus allowing the cell to attune to emerging conditions [<xref rid=""B32-biomolecules-14-00573"" ref-type=""bibr"">32</xref>,<xref rid=""B42-biomolecules-14-00573"" ref-type=""bibr"">42</xref>,<xref rid=""B43-biomolecules-14-00573"" ref-type=""bibr"">43</xref>].  What started as an attempt to understand skeletal muscle resistance to therapy in Pompe disease led to the deciphering complex pathophysiology of muscle damage; autophagic defect is now recognized as a classic characteristic of the disease along with lysosomal glycogen accumulation. With technological advances, including high-resolution in vivo imaging, the autophagy-related pathology can now be exploited for the assessment of new therapies that are under development—new replacement enzymes, various gene therapy strategies, and glycogen substrate reduction therapy.",N/A,13 5 2024
Acid α-glucosidase (GAA) activity and glycogen content in muscle biopsy specimens of patients with Pompe disease: A systematic review,"Pompe disease is a rare genetic disorder characterized by a deficiency of acid α-glucosidase (GAA), leading to the accumulation of glycogen in various tissues, especially in skeletal muscles. The disease manifests as a large spectrum of phenotypes from infantile-onset Pompe disease (IOPD) to late-onset Pompe disease (LOPD), depending on the age of symptoms onset. Quantifying GAA activity and glycogen content in skeletal muscle provides important information about the disease severity. However, the distribution of GAA and glycogen levels in skeletal muscles from healthy individuals and those impacted by Pompe disease remains poorly understood, and there is currently no universally accepted standard assay for GAA activity measurement. This systematic literature review aims to provide an overview of the available information on GAA activity and glycogen content levels in skeletal muscle biopsies from patients with Pompe disease. A structured review of PubMed and Google Scholar literature (with the latter used to check that no additional publications were identified) was conducted to identify peer-reviewed publications on glycogen storage disease type II [MeSH term] + GAA, protein human (supplementary concept), Pompe, muscle; and muscle, acid alpha-glucosidase. A limit of English language was applied. Results were grouped by methodologies used to quantify GAA activity and glycogen content in skeletal muscle. The search and selection strategy were devised and carried out in line with Preferred Reporting of Items in Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis guidelines and documented using a flowchart. Bibliographies of papers included in the analysis were reviewed and applicable publications not already identified in the search were included. Of the 158 articles retrieved, 24 (comprising >100 muscle biopsies from >100 patients) were included in the analysis, with four different assays. Analysis revealed that patients with IOPD exhibited markedly lower GAA activity in skeletal muscles than those with LOPD, regardless of the measurement method employed. Additionally, patients with IOPD had notably higher glycogen content levels in skeletal muscles than those with LOPD. In general, however, it was difficult to fully characterize GAA activity because of the different methods used. The findings underscore the challenges in the interpretation and comparison of the results across studies because of the substantial methodological variations. There is a need to establish standardized reference ranges of GAA activity and glycogen content in healthy individuals and in Pompe disease patients based on globally standardized methods to improve comparability and reliability in assessing this rare disease.","Pompe disease, or glycogen storage disease type II (GSDII; OMIM #232300), is a rare autosomal recessive disorder caused by biallelic mutations in the acid α-glucosidase (GAA) gene (MIM 606800) that encodes the lysosomal enzyme acid α-1,4-glucosidase (GAA; EC 3.2.1.20), formerly known as acid maltase [<xref rid=""bb0005"" ref-type=""bibr"">1</xref>]. GAA is active in lysosomes, where it breaks down glycogen [<xref rid=""bb0005"" ref-type=""bibr"">1</xref>] and releases free glucose [<xref rid=""bb0010"" ref-type=""bibr"">2</xref>], which is then transported to the cytosol for use in various cellular pathways. Without GAA, excess lysosomal glycogen blocks autophagy, leading to the accumulation of autophagic debris that is detrimental to myofiber function [<xref rid=""bb0015"" ref-type=""bibr"">[3]</xref>, <xref rid=""bb0020"" ref-type=""bibr"">[4]</xref>, <xref rid=""bb0025"" ref-type=""bibr"">[5]</xref>, <xref rid=""bb0030"" ref-type=""bibr"">[6]</xref>, <xref rid=""bb0035"" ref-type=""bibr"">[7]</xref>, <xref rid=""bb0040"" ref-type=""bibr"">[8]</xref>, <xref rid=""bb0045"" ref-type=""bibr"">[9]</xref>, <xref rid=""bb0050"" ref-type=""bibr"">[10]</xref>]. It is thought that a failure of productive autophagy and accumulation of potentially toxic ubiquitinated proteins contribute to severe muscle weakness and atrophy [<xref rid=""bb0055"" ref-type=""bibr"">11</xref>,<xref rid=""bb0060"" ref-type=""bibr"">12</xref>], the hallmarks of Pompe disease. The severity of Pompe disease is largely determined by the levels of residual GAA activity and is broadly categorized as a continuous spectrum from infantile to juvenile and adult-onset forms. Infantile-onset Pompe disease (IOPD) is caused by a near complete loss of GAA activity (<1%), with the effects typically observed in the first year or even in the first days after birth. IOPD is characterized by generalized muscle weakness, severe muscle hypotonia, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, and respiratory insufficiency [<xref rid=""bb0065"" ref-type=""bibr"">13</xref>]. Without treatment, patients with IOPD usually die by 1 year of age, primarily due to cardiac or respiratory failure [<xref rid=""bb0065"" ref-type=""bibr"">13</xref>,<xref rid=""bb0070"" ref-type=""bibr"">14</xref>]. Symptoms of late-onset Pompe disease (LOPD) vary greatly according to residual GAA activity (up to approximately −30% of normal). LOPD (alternatively classified as childhood, juvenile, or adult Pompe disease) encompasses patients with onset of symptoms from 12 months of age through adulthood and can manifest as late as the seventh decade of life [<xref rid=""bb0005"" ref-type=""bibr"">1</xref>]. LOPD typically progresses to both significant motor disability and respiratory insufficiency [<xref rid=""bb0015"" ref-type=""bibr"">3</xref>,<xref rid=""bb0020"" ref-type=""bibr"">4</xref>], the latter being the most life-threatening manifestation and the leading cause of morbidity in Pompe disease [<xref rid=""bb0005"" ref-type=""bibr"">1</xref>,<xref rid=""bb0025"" ref-type=""bibr"">5</xref>]. Unlike IOPD, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy is not typically observed in LOPD. The current standard of care for Pompe disease is enzyme replacement therapy (ERT), comprising repeated intravenous infusions of a recombinant human GAA (rhGAA) precursor enzyme (alglucosidase alfa, avalglucosidase alfa, or cipaglucosidase alfa with miglustat), which were first approved in 2006, 2022, and 2023, respectively. ERT acts by replacing GAA and, although it can be disease modifying, it is not curative [<xref rid=""bb0030"" ref-type=""bibr"">[6]</xref>, <xref rid=""bb0035"" ref-type=""bibr"">[7]</xref>, <xref rid=""bb0040"" ref-type=""bibr"">[8]</xref>, <xref rid=""bb0045"" ref-type=""bibr"">[9]</xref>]. In IOPD, ERT has been reported to rescue cardiac function, reduce the need for invasive ventilation, and improve survival [<xref rid=""bb0050"" ref-type=""bibr"">10</xref>,<xref rid=""bb0065"" ref-type=""bibr"">13</xref>]; however, in the long term (>30 months), IOPD patients still show disease progression with different muscular patterns and severe disease manifestations in the central nervous system, including cognitive problems [<xref rid=""bb0060"" ref-type=""bibr"">12</xref>,<xref rid=""bb0075"" ref-type=""bibr"">15</xref>,<xref rid=""bb0080"" ref-type=""bibr"">16</xref>]. In patients with LOPD, the response to ERT varies widely, and its effects can diminish over time [<xref rid=""bb0085"" ref-type=""bibr"">17</xref>]. Overall, the therapy has reduced mortality and improved mobility and respiratory function [<xref rid=""bb0050"" ref-type=""bibr"">10</xref>,<xref rid=""bb0090"" ref-type=""bibr"">18</xref>]; however, many patients still require wheelchairs and assisted ventilation despite ERT [<xref rid=""bb0050"" ref-type=""bibr"">10</xref>,<xref rid=""bb0095"" ref-type=""bibr"">[19]</xref>, <xref rid=""bb0100"" ref-type=""bibr"">[20]</xref>, <xref rid=""bb0105"" ref-type=""bibr"">[21]</xref>]. Although there are approaches that may improve the efficacy of ERT (e.g., increasing dose/frequency, improving uptake, upregulating expression of CI-M6PR or a combination of ERT with pharmacological chaperones to improve enzyme stability in plasma [<xref rid=""bb0110"" ref-type=""bibr"">[22]</xref>, <xref rid=""bb0115"" ref-type=""bibr"">[23]</xref>, <xref rid=""bb0120"" ref-type=""bibr"">[24]</xref>]), other modes of treatment, such as gene therapy (already in development [<xref rid=""bb0120"" ref-type=""bibr"">24</xref>]) may prove to be closer to a cure (or may prove to be more efficient). Gene therapy aims to replace the affected gene via a one-time infusion that results in continuous production of GAA [<xref rid=""bb0050"" ref-type=""bibr"">10</xref>,<xref rid=""bb0125"" ref-type=""bibr"">[25]</xref>, <xref rid=""bb0130"" ref-type=""bibr"">[26]</xref>, <xref rid=""bb0135"" ref-type=""bibr"">[27]</xref>]. Regardless of the approaches taken to modify the progression of Pompe disease, quantifying GAA activity and glycogen content in skeletal muscle provides information on the severity of the disease, which in turn guides treatment choices. Additionally, assessing these variables may help evaluate the response to therapy. However, there needs to be a greater understanding of GAA distribution and glycogen content in skeletal muscles from healthy individuals and those impacted by Pompe disease. Furthermore, there is currently no standard assay for GAA activity measurement that is universally agreed upon. This systematic literature review provides a detailed overview of the available information on the amount of GAA activity and glycogen content levels in skeletal muscle biopsy specimens from patients with Pompe disease.   Pompe disease is a rare genetic disorder characterized by a deficiency of GAA, resulting in glycogen accumulation in various tissues, particularly skeletal muscles. Current guidelines state that to make a diagnosis of Pompe disease, GAA enzyme activity should be assessed, a deficiency noted, and the presence of two disease-associated GAA variants should be confirmed using genetic testing [<xref rid=""bb0270"" ref-type=""bibr"">54</xref>]. Leukocytes, dried blood spots (DBS), and fibroblasts obtained from skin biopsies are often used for enzymatic diagnostic assays; however, it is recognized that analysis of muscle biopsies is more accurate as this is the tissue at risk [<xref rid=""bb0275"" ref-type=""bibr"">55</xref>]. In addition, there is a moderate risk of false results when using leukocyte-based or DBS assays, often necessitating a second assay to confirm a diagnosis [<xref rid=""bb0270"" ref-type=""bibr"">54</xref>]. Fibroblast assays require a long culturing time to derive fibroblasts from skin biopsies, making the approach unsuitable for timely diagnosis [<xref rid=""bb0270"" ref-type=""bibr"">54</xref>]. Although there are drawbacks to using muscle biopsies (mainly, the invasive nature of obtaining samples), this approach remains efficient in diagnosing Pompe disease. However, the lack of agreed approaches in terms of methodologies, substrates for analysis, and biopsy sites limit the use and comparability of the results. The current review provides a unique historical record and analysis of studies that have quantified GAA activity and glycogen content in muscle biopsies from patients with Pompe disease. It should, however, be noted that due to the low number of data points available, we chose to include data from all studies, regardless of pH. The findings reported here show that, as expected, GAA activity is higher and glycogen content lower in healthy individuals' muscles compared with patients with Pompe disease [<xref rid=""bb0065"" ref-type=""bibr"">13</xref>,<xref rid=""bb0285"" ref-type=""bibr"">56</xref>]. Data reported here suggest that GAA activity is markedly lower in patients with IOPD than those with LOPD, as evidenced by increased glycogen – a result observed across all analysis methods. Taken together with other studies examining the severity of both forms of Pompe disease, this suggests that more severe disease (i.e., IOPD) is associated with lower levels of GAA activity. These findings are supported by previous publications that reported an observational trend between disease severity and GAA activity [<xref rid=""bb0275"" ref-type=""bibr"">55</xref>,<xref rid=""bb0290"" ref-type=""bibr"">57</xref>]. As expected, glycogen content in muscle biopsy specimens was also lower in healthy individuals compared with Pompe disease patients. Furthermore, patients with IOPD had notably higher glycogen content levels in skeletal muscles than those with LOPD. The more pronounced accumulation of glycogen along with lower GAA activity in patients with IOPD (compared with LOPD) is associated with the more severe symptoms in these patients. Most of the studies in this analysis used biopsies from the quadriceps femoris muscle or unspecified mixed muscle groups, including quadriceps femoris, to quantify GAA activity and glycogen content. However, drawing any conclusions about GAA activity or glycogen content in a particular muscle was not possible, mainly due to the small sample size, variation in data reported, and methodological approaches. Indeed, the major limitation of this work is the wide variation in methodologies, making it difficult to draw meaningful comparisons across all data. As the included publications span over 50 years, “accepted” methods to quantify GAA activity and glycogen content have changed over time. To overcome or limit the impact of such changes, we focused on most commonly used enzymatic methods, in which maltose, glycogen, and MuαG were used as substrates. Despite this, variations still exist in the methods reported. Enzymatic methods used to determine GAA activity were conducted under acidic (pH 4.0–4.5) or neutral (pH 6.5–7.0) conditions in tissue homogenates or protein samples, and glucose concentration was then determined using spectrophotometry or fluorometry. However, there are variations in the specific substrates, their concentrations, and the pH conditions under which the reactions were carried out, even when the same substrate and measurement method were used. The implications of these methodological differences on study outcomes are unknown. Each laboratory has its own assay reference data which is used to confirm or disprove enzyme deficiency in every patient examined. A comprehensive, single-laboratory study of all diagnostic blood-based enzymatic assays conducted over 28-years comparing the MuαG and glycogen substrates suggested that MuαG with fibroblast samples is a more reliable substrate for discerning healthy from diseased individuals, and the only assay that could distinguish between classic IOPD versus childhood or adult onset [<xref rid=""bb0295"" ref-type=""bibr"">58</xref>]. However, a similar comparison has not been conducted with muscle biopsies. The methods used to determine glycogen content levels included amyloglucosidase hydrolysis and the anthrone approaches; both utilize different reagents to quantify glucose released during glycogen hydrolysis. However, the lack of comprehensive method descriptions in some publications limited objective determination and comparison of study results. Another limitation is that the analysis only covers articles written in English. We note that all the limitations underscore the need for a consistent approach and standardization of quantifying GAA enzyme activity and glycogen content in muscle biopsy specimens from healthy individuals and patients living with Pompe disease. There is a clear unmet need for establishing reference values for muscle GAA activity and glycogen levels to improve comparability between clinical studies and case reviews in this evolving rare disease. To establish a reliable threshold for the percentage of GAA activity that is considered as a “non-disease condition”, a reference range of normal GAA activity measured in limb muscle (e.g., vastus lateralis or biceps brachii) would first need to be defined using a standardized assay. The lack of this information in the literature only serves to strengthen the recommendations provided here. Ideally, our findings would provide confirmation of the best methods to be used for enzyme assays or glycogen measurement. However, at present, we can only provide a summary of the state-of-art methodology rather than definitive guidance on optimal methodology. Further studies are needed to investigate best methods, such as a large study that uses a single standardized assay to assess GAA activity in numerous muscle biopsies taken from both controls and individuals with Pompe disease. As expected, this analysis provides evidence of the relationship between Pompe disease severity and the levels of GAA enzyme activity and glycogen content in muscle. The substantial methodological variations noted here demonstrate the need for globally standardized methods for measuring muscle GAA activity and glycogen content, to allow more accurate assessment of the disease severity and better define the efficacy parameters of a therapeutic intervention.

Optimizing treatment outcomes: immune tolerance induction in Pompe disease patients undergoing enzyme replacement therapy,,"Pompe disease, a rare genetic disorder, results from a deficiency in the enzyme acid alpha-glucosidase (GAA), leading to glycogen accumulation in various tissues, particularly the muscles (<xref rid=""B1"" ref-type=""bibr"">1</xref>). The abnormal buildup of glycogen causes muscle deterioration and weakness, manifesting as cardiomyopathy, mobility impairments, and, eventually, respiratory failure. Pompe disease is divided into two main subtypes: infantile-onset Pompe disease (IOPD), characterized by the development of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM), and late-onset Pompe disease (LOPD), which does not exhibit HCM (<xref rid=""B2"" ref-type=""bibr"">2</xref>, <xref rid=""B3"" ref-type=""bibr"">3</xref>). The primary therapeutic approach for Pompe disease is enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) with recombinant human GAA (rhGAA) (<xref rid=""B4"" ref-type=""bibr"">4</xref>–<xref rid=""B6"" ref-type=""bibr"">6</xref>). While ERT is the standard Pompe disease treatment, its effectiveness is limited, particularly in advanced stages (<xref rid=""B7"" ref-type=""bibr"">7</xref>). The development of anti-rhGAA immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies can diminish ERT’s efficacy, resulting in suboptimal clinical outcomes (<xref rid=""B8"" ref-type=""bibr"">8</xref>), with antibody titers as low as 1:12,800 affecting treatment effectiveness. High-sustained rhGAA IgG antibody titers (HSAT), defined as titers of ≥ 1:12,800, further complicate the treatment landscape (<xref rid=""B8"" ref-type=""bibr"">8</xref>–<xref rid=""B10"" ref-type=""bibr"">10</xref>). A patient’s ability to produce endogenous GAA, which is defined as cross-reactive immunologic material (CRIM) status, correlates with the development of anti-drug antibodies (ADA) (<xref rid=""B11"" ref-type=""bibr"">11</xref>). Based on the presence of endogenous GAA, IOPD patients are classified as either CRIM-positive or CRIM-negative. Significantly, a majority of CRIM-negative and approximately one-third of CRIM-positive IOPD patients are prone to developing HSAT, which may lead to clinical deterioration (<xref rid=""B8"" ref-type=""bibr"">8</xref>, <xref rid=""B10"" ref-type=""bibr"">10</xref>, <xref rid=""B12"" ref-type=""bibr"">12</xref>). Immune modulation has emerged as a promising strategy to mitigate the ADA response and enhance the efficacy of ERT, particularly in CRIM-negative IOPD patients (<xref rid=""B13"" ref-type=""bibr"">13</xref>, <xref rid=""B14"" ref-type=""bibr"">14</xref>). Various preventative and therapeutic approaches have been employed in treating Pompe disease patients. For CRIM-negative IOPD patients, initiating immune tolerance induction (ITI) therapy concurrent with ERT has become the standard of care, aiming to prevent ADA formation and minimize their negative impact on treatment (<xref rid=""B13"" ref-type=""bibr"">13</xref>, <xref rid=""B15"" ref-type=""bibr"">15</xref>). Several immunomodulatory agents, including rituximab, methotrexate, intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg), and omalizumab, have been tested as monotherapy or combined, achieving varying degrees of success (<xref rid=""B15"" ref-type=""bibr"">15</xref>–<xref rid=""B18"" ref-type=""bibr"">18</xref>). Consequently, prophylactic immunomodulation prior to ERT initiation is commonly used in CRIM-positive IOPD patients at high risk of ADA development or those with indeterminate CRIM status requiring urgent treatment (<xref rid=""B10"" ref-type=""bibr"">10</xref>, <xref rid=""B19"" ref-type=""bibr"">19</xref>). However, consensus on the impact of ADA on therapeutic efficacy and the necessity of ITI for LOPD patients remains elusive. Approximately 10 percent of LOPD patients develop ADA, with some showing HSAT associated with clinical decline (<xref rid=""B20"" ref-type=""bibr"">20</xref>). Conversely, other studies indicate that long-term ERT in LOPD patients leads to high ADA titer, but the immune responses to rhGAA following treatment do not significantly affect its efficacy (<xref rid=""B21"" ref-type=""bibr"">21</xref>). The diverse characteristics and varied treatment responses among LOPD patients complicate the assessment of ERT effects and ADA’s influence on this group (<xref rid=""B22"" ref-type=""bibr"">22</xref>). This study aims to offer insights into immunogenicity in CRIM-positive patients and explore the role of immunomodulation in CRIM-positive Pompe patients exhibiting high ADA levels undergoing ERT. The study encompassed both IOPD and LOPD patients who developed high ADAs and received therapeutic ITI treatment. Our therapeutic immunomodulation therapy, incorporating rituximab, methotrexate, IVIg, and bortezomib, has shown success in eliminating IgG antibodies in patients with HSAT, thereby establishing immune tolerance (<xref rid=""B14"" ref-type=""bibr"">14</xref>).    In conclusion, our research indicates that ITI effectively reduces ADA titers in both IOPD and LOPD patients. We observed improvements in urinary Glc<sub>4</sub> levels, yet the direct clinical benefits of ITI, particularly in enhancing muscle and respiratory functions, remain uncertain. This ambiguity could be attributed to several factors, including the inability of ITI to reverse pre-existing muscle damage, the limited sensitivity of our evaluation tools, and the necessity for extended follow-up periods. Our study underscores the critical importance of continuous ADA titers monitoring in CRIM-positive IOPD and LOPD patients undergoing ERT. Additionally, the duration of HSAT before initiating ITI may also influence treatment efficacy. Given the disease’s heterogeneity and the constrained sample size of our study, there’s a pressing need for a unified strategy to identify Pompe disease patients at an increased risk of ADA development, and to initiate ITI at the earliest time. Further research with larger, multicenter, and more homogeneous cohorts is essential to validate our findings and assess the efficacy of ITI therapy across diverse patient populations. Such research endeavors will facilitate the development of more efficient, tailored treatment regimens for this complex condition.
