8650 Co-Localization Pattern of Snhg14 Long Noncoding RNA and Nhlh2 mRNA in Hypothalamus Coincides with Obesity and Endocrine Impairment Phenotypes in Prader-Willi Syndrome,"
<bold>Disclosure: S. Ariyanfar:</bold> None. <bold>C.K. Thompson:</bold> None. <bold>S. Tobet:</bold> None. <bold>D.J. Good:</bold> None. Prader–Willi syndrome (PWS) is a multisystemic neurodevelopmental disorder, characterized by biphasic symptoms, including diminished weight gain during development, along with neonatal hypotonia and failure to thrive, with later onset hyperphagia, severe weight gain, and morbid obesity. PWS arises from the deletion or inactivation of paternally inherited genes, with the smallest region encompassing a group of 30 small nucleolar RNAs ‘snoRNAs’ known as the <italic toggle=""yes"">SNORD116@</italic> locus. <italic toggle=""yes"">SNORD116@</italic> snoRNAs are cleaved from a larger long non-coding gene, <italic toggle=""yes"">SNHG14</italic>. Whole-body deletion of <italic toggle=""yes"">Nhlh2</italic> in mice results in PWS-like phenotypes, such as later onset weight gain, and delayed puberty. We previously have shown that overexpression of <italic toggle=""yes"">Snord116-3</italic> in a mouse hypothalamic cell line improves the stability of <italic toggle=""yes"">Nhlh2</italic> mRNA, likely through a motif in the 3’ untranslated region of the <italic toggle=""yes"">Nhlh2</italic> mRNA. This motif can be disrupted by the presence of a single nucleotide polymorphism, confirming the mechanism of action. Nevertheless, to date, no published studies are showing the <italic toggle=""yes"">in vivo</italic> co-localization between <italic toggle=""yes"">Nhlh2</italic> and <italic toggle=""yes"">Snord116</italic> (or its host gene, <italic toggle=""yes"">Snhg14</italic>), and the question of where and when <italic toggle=""yes"">Snord116</italic> snoRNAs interact with target mRNA <italic toggle=""yes"">Nhlh2</italic> remains unanswered. To fill this gap, we mapped simultaneous expression of <italic toggle=""yes"">Snhg14</italic> and <italic toggle=""yes"">Nhlh2</italic> throughout the adult mouse brain, using quantitative RNA multi-plex in situ hybridization “RNAScope”. In our initial analysis, we focused on <italic toggle=""yes"">Pomc</italic> neurons of the hypothalamus as targeted deletion of <italic toggle=""yes"">Nhlh2</italic> in these neurons results in obesity levels similar to that of the whole body deletion of <italic toggle=""yes"">Nhlh2</italic>, a present phenotype in PWS. Our data for the first time showed the co-expression of <italic toggle=""yes"">Nhlh2</italic> and <italic toggle=""yes"">Snhg14</italic> in <italic toggle=""yes"">Pomc</italic> neurons of Arcuate nucleus. In the analysis of 54 <italic toggle=""yes"">Pomc</italic> neurons, 72% and 39% were positive for <italic toggle=""yes"">Nhlh2</italic> and <italic toggle=""yes"">Snhg14</italic> expression respectively, with 39% of detected signals co-expressed in the same cell (correlation coefficient 0.78, P < 0.0001). Interestingly, in neurons that only expressed <italic toggle=""yes"">Nhlh2</italic> (33) there were nearly evenly distributed signals in the cytoplasm (9 cells) and nucleus (10 cells). When both <italic toggle=""yes"">Nhlh2</italic> and <italic toggle=""yes"">Snhg14</italic> messages were coexpressed, 17 of the 21 cells expressed <italic toggle=""yes"">Nhlh2</italic> in the nucleus only (P < 0.0003, P< 0.0007 for the Likelihood ratio test and Chi-square test, respectively). Thus, based on the high magnification cell analysis, acquired 3D images, and probe location, we can conclude that the <italic toggle=""yes"">Snhg14</italic> host transcript and <italic toggle=""yes"">Nhlh2</italic> interact spatially. This new <italic toggle=""yes"">in vivo</italic> data supports the previously shown regulatory role for <italic toggle=""yes"">Snord 116</italic> snoRNAs towards <italic toggle=""yes"">Nhlh2</italic> mRNA stability and suggests that regulation may involve nuclear sequestration of <italic toggle=""yes"">Nhlh2</italic>. We are currently extending our studies to examine expression in the brains from patients with PWS and determine if energy balance signals affect co-localization patterns within the hypothalamus.

8486 Age at diagnosis in Prader Willi Syndrome (PWS),"

PWS is a complex neurodevelopmental disorder characterised by neonatal hypotonia,failure to thrive, hypothalamic and endocrine dysfunction, behavioural and learning difficulties and hyperphagia. It is caused by absence of expression of paternally imprinted genes on chromosome 15q11-q13. PWS is confirmed by genetic methylation analysis of this region. Most patients with PWS are referred for genetic investigations in the first months of life due to severe hypotonia and/or failure to thrive. However, it is known that some patients are still only diagnosed in adulthood, with resulting missed opportunities for prompt early treatments for PWS, such as growth hormone therapy. Little information is available on age of diagnosis of PWS, and whether opportunities to request genetic investigation are missed in childhood. We therefore aimed to study age at diagnosis of PWS in the UK. To do so, we assessed data as reported to the UK patient association PWSA-UK from 1968-2023, and additionally audited PWS genetic testing by the North Thames Genomics Laboratory Hub from 2019-22. Of 1145 people registered at PWSA as having PWS, 945 had an age of diagnosis recorded. Of these, 254 (28%) were diagnosed over 1 year of age. From March 2021 to Sept 2023, 13 were diagnosed over 1 year of age with a mean age at diagnosis of 9.27 yr (95% CI 4.15 to 14.4) and with 8 patients below 5 years of age. We assessed PWS diagnoses made in blocks of 4 years from 1968, and the number of PWS diagnoses in people over age 1 year in those time blocks. The number of diagnoses in people over 1 year of age appeared to decrease since 1996 to 7 but from 2015 this has been fluctuating. North Thames Genomics Laboratory Hub provides testing for around 10 million people in and around London. Over a 3-year period between 2019-2022, there were 59 requests for PWS testing. 28 of these were positive (a 47% diagnostic yield). 20/28 (71%) of patients were diagnosed under 1 month of age, 7% were diagnosed at 1-24 months of age, 3.5% at 2-5 yrs and 18% at >5 yrs of age (one at age 9, two at age 18, one at age 29 and one at 33 yrs of age). Most tests were performed in children under1 month of age (91% yield), followed by those over 5 yrs of age (30% yield). For 10 individuals, microarray was requested, however methylation studies would have been more appropriate. All patients diagnosed over 5 years of age had hypotonia and were described as hyperphagic and having intellectual disability, and 75% were obese. Patients diagnosed after age 8were described as having neonatal hypotonia and may have been eligible for genetic testing soon after birth. These data suggest that a considerable percentage of patients are diagnosed with PWS after the first year of life in the UK. Further root analysis, interventions, and education is required to reduce age at diagnosis in patients with PWS to allow for optimal management starting in the first few months of life.

<bold>Background:</bold> Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) is a rare genetic neurobehavioral-metabolic disease characterized by hyperphagia, endocrinopathies, weight gain, hypotonia, behavioral problems, and an increased risk of mortality and reduced life expectancy. There are currently no approved treatments for hyperphagia in PWS. Diazoxide choline extended-release (DCCR) is a novel, once daily oral therapy being developed for the treatment of PWS. Herein, we present results of the Randomized Withdrawal Period (RWP) of Clinical Study C602, a long-term treatment study of DCCR in people with PWS. <bold>Objectives and Methods:</bold> This was a 16-week multi-center, double-blind, placebo-controlled RWP that enrolled participants ≥4 years of age who were actively enrolled in the open label period of Clinical Study C602 and had received 2-4 years of DCCR treatment (target dose: ≥3.3 mg/kg; optimal range: 4.2-5.8 mg/kg) at the time of RWP entry. RWP-eligible participants were randomized 1:1 to continue DCCR or withdraw from DCCR and receive Placebo. The primary objective was to evaluate the effect of continued DCCR administration versus Placebo on hyperphagia based on the change in Hyperphagia Questionnaire for Clinical Trials (HQ-CT) Total Score from Baseline to Week 16. Additional endpoints included: the Clinical Global Impression of Severity (CGI-S) and Clinical Global Impression of Improvement (CGI-I) at Week 16; changes in body composition (weight, BMI, and BMI z-scores) at Week 16; and the safety profile of DCCR. <bold>Results:</bold> DCCR (n=38) and Placebo (n=39) groups were generally balanced for demographic and baseline characteristics. At Week 16, a statistically significant difference in change from baseline in HQ-CT Total Score was observed between DCCR and Placebo groups with HQ-CT Total Scores increasing markedly (indicating worsening hyperphagia) in the Placebo group compared to the DCCR group (LSMean difference [SE] -5.0 [1.57], p=0.002). CGI-S and CGI-I showed trends towards worsening in the Placebo group versus the DCCR group (p=0.079 and 0.092, respectively). The Placebo group also experienced significantly greater increases in weight, BMI, and BMI z-scores (p=0.035, 0.034, and 0.023, respectively) than the DCCR group. DCCR was well-tolerated, with no new or unexpected safety signals, and no serious adverse events or discontinuations due to adverse events in the DCCR group. <bold>Conclusions:</bold> In this 16-week RWP, the Placebo group experienced significant worsening in hyperphagia and increases in body weight, BMI, and BMI z-scores, along with worsening trends for the CGI-S and CGI-I, compared to the DCCR group. DCCR was well tolerated, with a safety profile that was consistent with prior experience. These data suggest treatment with DCCR may lead to clinical benefits in people with PWS by reducing hyperphagia and improving body composition.

Growth hormone treatment in children with Prader–Willi syndrome: safety and effectiveness data from the PATRO Children study,,"Prader–Willi syndrome (PWS) is a complex genetic disorder that arises from loss of expression of paternal alleles in the PWS region of chromosome 15 (15q11-q13).<sup>

</sup> This article reports safety and effectiveness data from the subgroup of patients with PWS who were included in PATRO Children as of July 2020.   The PATRO Children study was designed to gather valuable data on the safety and effectiveness of Omnitrope treatment in pediatric patients in a real-life clinical setting. In this analysis of patients with PWS, the median (range) treatment duration was 56.8 (2.9–155.8) months (median approximately 4.7 years). Results from this analysis demonstrated that Omnitrope is well tolerated in the majority of these mostly very young patients with PWS. Most AEs were considered to be unrelated to rhGH therapy and were mild or moderate in intensity. No new safety concerns regarding rhGH therapy in PWS were raised from this analysis. The most frequently reported treatment-related AEs and SAEs were sleep apnea syndrome, adenoidal hypertrophy, and tonsillar hypertrophy; these events were expected in this population as breathing and sleep disorders are well-documented features of PWS. In terms of the timing of treatment-related AEs and SAEs, around 50% occurred in the first year of treatment. The findings from this analysis are consistent with previous reports of rhGH treatment safety in patients with PWS from observational studies. In a retrospective, observational study of 41 prepubertal rhGH-treated patients with PWS, the most frequently reported AEs were respiratory tract infection (14.6%) and scoliosis (19.5%),<sup>
<xref rid=""bibr24-20420188241264343"" ref-type=""bibr"">24</xref>
</sup> both well-documented comorbidities of PWS. These were also the most frequent AEs in our analysis, with 20.4% of patients reporting scoliosis and 16.2% of patients reporting respiratory tract infections. In an analysis of 2332 patients with PWS treated with rhGH in the Pfizer International Growth Database, scoliosis was also the most frequently reported AE, although reported by fewer patients compared with our analysis (6.6%).<sup>
<xref rid=""bibr13-20420188241264343"" ref-type=""bibr"">13</xref>

</sup> In this analysis, which included a median treatment duration of 4.7 years, only three patients with PWS developed impaired glucose tolerance (one case considered by investigators to be treatment-related) and one patient developed type 2 diabetes mellitus (considered by investigators to be treatment-related). The patient who developed type 2 diabetes mellitus was classified as having obesity at time of this diagnosis (BMI of 46.6 kg/m<sup>2</sup>). Our findings are consistent with previous studies that demonstrated rhGH therapy in children with PWS has little or no impact on glucose metabolism.<sup><xref rid=""bibr11-20420188241264343"" ref-type=""bibr"">11</xref>,<xref rid=""bibr26-20420188241264343"" ref-type=""bibr"">26</xref>,<xref rid=""bibr27-20420188241264343"" ref-type=""bibr"">27</xref></sup> In one study, glucose metabolism improved over 3 years of rhGH treatment in 36 pediatric patients with PWS.<sup>

</sup> One explanation could be that GH’s effect to decrease insulin sensitivity is counteracted by the improvement in body composition (decreased fat mass, increased lean mass), which itself improves insulin sensitivity. Patients with PWS often have reduced pulmonary function linked to physical characteristics of the syndrome, such as obesity, scoliosis, hypotonia, and respiratory muscle weakness.<sup><xref rid=""bibr25-20420188241264343"" ref-type=""bibr"">25</xref>,<xref rid=""bibr29-20420188241264343"" ref-type=""bibr"">29</xref></sup> Pulmonary function impairments, together with other factors, contribute to the frequent occurrence of respiratory sleep disorders found in patients with PWS.<sup>

<xref rid=""bibr13-20420188241264343"" ref-type=""bibr"">13</xref>
</sup> Compared with the overall population of patients enrolled in PATRO Children (which includes the PWS cohort), a higher proportion of patients in the PWS subpopulation reported AEs (81.7% <italic toggle=""yes"">versus</italic> 45.8%), SAEs (40.9% <italic toggle=""yes"">versus</italic> 10.6%), and treatment-related SAEs (9.4% <italic toggle=""yes"">versus</italic> 0.6%).<sup>
<xref rid=""bibr21-20420188241264343"" ref-type=""bibr"">21</xref>
</sup> Patients with PWS require closer monitoring during the first years of rhGH therapy compared with other pediatric indications due to the risk of respiratory sleep disorders. To reduce this risk, consensus guidelines recommend carrying out repeat polysomnography (and/or oximetry) during the first 3–6 months of rhGH treatment.<sup>

</sup> Despite these recommendations, there was wide variation in the baseline dose reported in our analysis (range 2.0–51.0 µg/kg/day in patients who were rhGH treatment-naïve at study entry). Furthermore, the median dose reported in this group at baseline (22.5 µg/kg/day) was considerably higher than the recommended starting dose. As most patients with PWS are overweight or have obesity, weight-based dosing calculations can result in rhGH doses that are too high. The most recent consensus guidelines therefore recommend calculating the appropriate dose using body surface area or, if using patient weight, basing calculations on a non-obese weight corresponding to the patient’s height.<sup>
<xref rid=""bibr32-20420188241264343"" ref-type=""bibr"">32</xref>
</sup> Despite the higher-than-recommended starting dose, over the course of the study the majority of patients stayed below the standard GH dose of 35.0 µg/kg/day, with >70% of naïve patients receiving mean doses of ⩽30.0 µg/kg/day over the first 6 years. This may reflect an attempt to avoid, or the fear of, side effects in patients with PWS treated with GH. These data demonstrate that rhGH (Omnitrope) therapy is effective in patients with PWS in real-world clinical practice. Despite observing a decrease for AHSDS parameters relative to height data from the general population, improvements were recorded in growth parameters, consistent with previous studies of rhGH treatment in these patients. Various factors, including variability in duration of therapy and dosing, as well as the heterogeneity of response, may contribute to this observed discrepancy. Low pubertal height gain observed in patients with PWS can result in reduced AHSDS relative to height data from the general population. Mean AHSDS values relative to height data from a population of GH-naïve patients with PWS were +0.39, demonstrating the effectiveness of Omnitrope in terms of height gain in this patient population. In this study, the mean (SD) values for HV, HSDS, HVSDS, and BMI SDS in prepubertal patients after 3 years of Omnitrope treatment were comparable with those observed in previous studies in prepubertal children with PWS treated with GH.<sup><xref rid=""bibr10-20420188241264343"" ref-type=""bibr"">10</xref>,<xref rid=""bibr13-20420188241264343"" ref-type=""bibr"">13</xref>,<xref rid=""bibr34-20420188241264343"" ref-type=""bibr"">34</xref></sup> A retrospective study from Turkey also demonstrated the effectiveness of rhGH in improving HSDS over up to 2 years of treatment in 21 patients with PWS.<sup>

</sup> Nonetheless, as BMI is easy to measure and calculate without requiring access to specialist equipment, it is the method used to measure fat by the majority of pediatric clinics and health practices globally. While BMI increased in patients in this study, mean total fat mass decreased from 33.6% at baseline to 21.9% at 3 years, and mean lean body mass increased from 42.5% at baseline to 60.6% at 3 years. It is important to note that these assessments are based on a relatively small cohort of patients, as data were collected according to routine clinical practice and facilities to measure fat mass and lean body mass are not available in all clinics.

</sup> Among rhGH-naïve patients included in the current analysis, the mean age at start of treatment was 2.85 years; this difference likely reflects delays in specialist referral/diagnosis in the real-world setting. Alongside delayed access to specialist treatment centers and delayed diagnosis, fears of an increase in adenoid tissue in infants can also result in the late initiation of GH treatment. Treatment delays can result from the fact that some centers will wait until sleep apnea and other breathing problems have been excluded prior to initiating GH to reduce the risk of treatment complications. Difficulties in carrying out or accessing polysomnography studies can contribute to delays in these situations. Results from this study suggest that the incidence of SAEs and treatment-related SAEs may be higher in younger patients with PWS treated with rhGH; however, it is important to note that these analyses are limited by the fact that 70% of patients in this study were aged ⩽3 years and more than 80% of SAEs occurred in this age group, along with the generally low incidence of SAEs, particularly treatment-related SAEs. A topic of clinical interest that was outside of the scope of our study is the potential relationship between AEs and IGF-I levels in patients with PWS. This is a complex topic that would require an appropriately designed prospective study to investigate robustly. As PATRO Children was a non-interventional study, physicians were not mandated to collect IGF-I measurements at specific timepoints, nor in association with AEs, precluding a reliable analysis of this relationship. The potential relationship between AEs and IGF-I levels should be investigated in future studies in patients with PWS, as outcomes could help to guide clinical management of these patients. The PATRO Children study has some limitations that are common to all observational studies. First, there is a risk of selection bias due to enrollment of patients only from selected clinics, and information bias due to missing or erroneous data collection, as data are collected according to routine clinical practice. As a result, some assessments in the current analysis are based on a relatively small amount of data. Second, calculation and justification of the sample size for this analysis were not carried out. The sample size included in the analysis was relatively small; therefore, our findings may need to be verified in a larger population. Furthermore, the median treatment duration was relatively short (approximately 4.7 years), which may limit the interpretation of some data, such as side effects of treatment that may take several years to develop. As patients were enrolled from multiple centers, there may be some differences in the management of patients with PWS at a country and center level; any potential differences were not identified or considered in our analysis. Finally, as there was often a 6–12-month period between patient visits, and limited consultation time during routine visits in some cases, there is a possibility that some AEs were under-reported. These data demonstrate that Omnitrope treatment is well tolerated and effective in this population of pediatric patients with PWS treated in real-world clinical practice. Our data extend the evidence-base for the benefits of rhGH when used in this patient population. Well-known safety issues in patients with PWS (such as respiratory and sleep disorders, scoliosis, and diabetes) should continue to be closely monitored during rhGH treatment.",N/A,29 9 2024
Inpatient Hospitalizations for COVID-19 Among Patients with Prader-Willi Syndrome: a National Inpatient Sample Analysis,,"Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) is a genetic disorder caused by loss of function of the paternally inherited 15q11-q13 locus [<xref rid=""R9"" ref-type=""bibr"">Chung et al., 2020</xref>]. Multiple genetic mechanisms are responsible for this imprinting disorder, which in total affects 1/10,000 to 1/30,000 births [<xref rid=""R8"" ref-type=""bibr"">Cassidy et al., 2012</xref>]. Clinical features of PWS are age-dependent, with wide-ranging neuromuscular, endocrine, and behavioral manifestations [<xref rid=""R6"" ref-type=""bibr"">Butler et al., 2018</xref>; <xref rid=""R27"" ref-type=""bibr"">Manzardo et al., 2018</xref>; <xref rid=""R5"" ref-type=""bibr"">Bohonowych et al., 2019</xref>]. Multiple of these coalesce to result in impaired pulmonary mechanics, respiratory control, and sleep-disordered breathing [<xref rid=""R17"" ref-type=""bibr"">Gillett and Perez, 2016</xref>]. Individuals with PWS are at high risk of developing obesity as a result of hyperphagia and food-seeking behaviors [<xref rid=""R12"" ref-type=""bibr"">Dykens et al., 2007</xref>], with subsequent mechanical effects on lung function [<xref rid=""R33"" ref-type=""bibr"">Peters and Dixon, 2018</xref>]. This is compounded by hypotonia, another core feature of PWS, which results in respiratory muscle weakness [<xref rid=""R20"" ref-type=""bibr"">Hákonarson et al., 1995</xref>]. Respiratory dysfunction in individuals with PWS occurs even in the absence of obesity, however, largely through central mechanisms. These include reduced chemoreceptor function in PWS [<xref rid=""R18"" ref-type=""bibr"">Gozal et al., 1994</xref>] resulting in aberrant ventilatory responses to hypercapnia, hypoxia, and hyperoxia independent from the degree of obesity [<xref rid=""R35"" ref-type=""bibr"">Schlüter et al., 1997</xref>; <xref rid=""R25"" ref-type=""bibr"">Livingston et al., 1995</xref>]. There is also substantial hypothalamic dysfunction in PWS [<xref rid=""R37"" ref-type=""bibr"">Tauber and Hoybye, 2021</xref>], with corresponding effects on respiration and sleep/wake function [<xref rid=""R22"" ref-type=""bibr"">Itani et al., 2023</xref>]. Individuals with PWS also have very high rates of obstructive sleep apnea and aspiration. Together these mechanisms are responsible for the high rates of respiratory disorders in individuals with PWS [<xref rid=""R14"" ref-type=""bibr"">Festen et al., 2006</xref>]. Respiratory disorders are also the greatest cause of death in individuals with PWS in longitudinal studies, accounting for 31–50% of deaths [<xref rid=""R7"" ref-type=""bibr"">Butler et al., 2017</xref>; <xref rid=""R32"" ref-type=""bibr"">Pacoricona Alfaro et al., 2019</xref>], with high rates of death due to both respiratory failure and respiratory infections. In the general population, obesity is associated with greater severity of COVID-19 infection and worse outcomes [<xref rid=""R34"" ref-type=""bibr"">Russo et al., 2023</xref>; <xref rid=""R16"" ref-type=""bibr"">Gao et al., 2021</xref>; <xref rid=""R24"" ref-type=""bibr"">Kompaniyets, 2021</xref>], as is obstructive sleep apnea [<xref rid=""R2"" ref-type=""bibr"">Arish et al., 2023</xref>]. Moreover, COVID-19 infection itself may increase risk of aspiration [<xref rid=""R19"" ref-type=""bibr"">Grilli et al., 2022</xref>] and may directly cause respiratory muscle weakness [<xref rid=""R36"" ref-type=""bibr"">Severin et al., 2022</xref>], conditions which are highly prevalent in PWS patients at baseline. Given this, infection with the COVID-19 virus may be expected to be especially dangerous for individuals with PWS. Initial evidence, however, suggest paradoxically low severity of COVID-19 infections among such individuals. One survey in France between March 2020 and Jan 2021 of 288 adults with PWS found that 13.2% had confirmed COVID-19 infection, with 12 of the 38 infected individuals (31.6%) admitted to the hospital, with no ICU admissions and no deaths [<xref rid=""R10"" ref-type=""bibr"">Coupaye et al., 2021</xref>]. Among these hospitalized cases, however, 10 were residing in the hospital setting at time of infection. Among 239 children with PWS in the same study, 5.4% had COVID-19 during the study period with no hospitalizations or deaths. This infection rate was lower than that of the general French population at the time. A second international survey of 72 individuals with PWS from May 2020 through April 2021 identified 56 individuals diagnosed with COVID-19 (77.8%), of whom six (10.7%) were hospitalized, with no deaths [<xref rid=""R40"" ref-type=""bibr"">Whittington et al., 2022</xref>]. While these survey findings suggest that COVID-19 infections in individuals with PWS may be unexpectedly mild, such surveys are inherently limited by response bias and thus cannot inform disease severity on a population level. A greater understanding of the course of COVID-19 hospitalizations among individuals with PWS would help optimize clinical care of individuals with PWS and may point towards unique disease pathology in such patients which would provide information about COVID-19 infections in the broader population. This study analyzes COVID-19 infections among individuals with and without PWS in a large all-payor database of US hospital discharges in 2020 and 2021.  In 2020 and 2021 there were a total of 295 (95% CI: 228 to 362) hospitalizations for individuals with PWS involving infection with COVID-19 and 4,112,400 (95% CI: 4,051,497 to 4,173,303) hospitalizations involving a diagnosis of COVID-19 infection among individuals without PWS. Full demographic information is shown in <xref rid=""T1"" ref-type=""table"">Table 1</xref>. Patients with PWS hospitalized with COVID-19 had a median age of 33 years compared to a median age of 63 years for those without PWS (<xref rid=""F1"" ref-type=""fig"">Figure 1</xref>). Males represented 62.7% of COVID-19 hospitalizations for individuals with PWS compared to 51.7% of COVID-19 hospitalizations for those without PWS. Among baseline comorbidities, obesity codes were present in 47.5% of PWS hospitalizations compared to 28.4% of non-PWS hospitalizations, while chronic pulmonary disease was present in 23.7% of PWS hospitalizations and 21.4% of non-PWS hospitalizations. Baseline comorbidities are listed in <xref rid=""T2"" ref-type=""table"">Table 2</xref>. Among COVID hospitalizations for individuals with PWS, 18.6% involved the use of mechanical ventilation, compared to 11.6% of hospitalizations for individuals without PWS. In-hospital death occurred in 8.5% of hospitalizations for individuals with PWS compared to 12.8% of hospitalizations for those without PWS. Among patients who died, median age was 30 years for PWS patients and 72 years for those without PWS. Overall length of stay was a median of 6 days (IQR: 4 to 14) for patients with PWS compared to 5 days (IQR: 3 to 10) for those without PWS. Median hospital charges were $64,804 (IQR: $30,205 to $152,551) for individuals with PWS compared to $47,846 (IQR: $25,640 to $96,094) for individuals without PWS. To estimate the effect of PWS diagnosis on hospital outcomes, AIPW was performed with PWS diagnosis (yes/no) as a binary exposure variable with age, sex, race, primary hospital service line, and year as covariates (<xref rid=""T3"" ref-type=""table"">Table 3</xref>). In these models, PWS diagnosis was associated with a 7.43 day increase in hospital length of stay and a $80,126 increase in hospital charges. PWS was associated with a higher odds of mechanical ventilation utilization, with an odds ratio (OR) of 1.79. PWS diagnosis was additionally associated with a higher odds of death during hospitalization (OR 1.67). In 2020 and 2021, an estimated 295 (95% CI: 228 to 362) hospitalizations for patients with PWS and COVID-19 occurred in the United States. In adjusted models, compared to hospitalizations for patients without PWS, those with PWS had substantially longer hospital length of stay and hospital charges as well as increased odds of requiring mechanical ventilation or dying during hospitalization. Together, these results demonstrate the substantial clinical impact of COVID-19 infection on hospitalization outcomes for individuals with PWS as well as the increased cost and duration of these hospitalizations. Patients with PWS hospitalized with COVID-19 had a median age of 33 years, compared to 63 years for those without PWS. As age is substantially associated with COVID-19 mortality [<xref rid=""R13"" ref-type=""bibr"">Elo et al., 2022</xref>], older median age likely explains much of the higher crude mortality observed in non-PWS hospitalizations. Among patients who died, median age for patients with PWS was 42 years younger than for patients without PWS, highlighting the early in-hospital mortality for individuals with PWS hospitalized with COVID-19 compared to those without PWS. This suggests that, contrary to prior survey studies, the clinical course of COVID-19 is not milder for patients with PWS in the subset of individuals who are ill enough to require hospitalization. These inpatient data cannot, however, inform the overall clinical course of COVID-19 infection in individuals with PWS as it is possible that the overall severity of infectious symptoms in PWS is equal, less severe, or more severe than in the general population. A hypothesized mechanism of improved innate immunity in individuals with PWS resulting in lower overall viral disease severity remains a possibility [<xref rid=""R38"" ref-type=""bibr"">Viardot et al., 2010</xref>]. These data do suggest, however, that severe COVID-19 infection resulting in hospitalization and early death remains possible in the context of PWS as may be expected from the baseline impaired respiratory function in such individuals. As a result, individuals with PWS should be considered at high risk for severe COVID-19, and patients and families should continue to utilize strategies, including vaccination, to reduce the risk of severe complications of infection. The overall number of COVID-19-associated in-hospital deaths in 2020 and 2021 captured by the NIS was 528,149, which is comparable to estimates of in-hospital deaths during the same time period (579,199) from the National Center for Health Statistics of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) using different data reporting methodology [COVID-19 Provisional Counts - Weekly Updates by Select Demographic and Geographic Characteristics, 2023]. The CDC data counted a total of 848,943 COVID-19-associated deaths in all settings during this period, meaning that 32% of COVID-19 deaths occurred outside of the inpatient setting. It is unclear if this ratio for the general population applies to individuals with PWS, or if a lower or higher fraction of deaths of individuals with PWS occurred inpatient and is captured by this analysis. Baseline comorbidities including obesity, pulmonary disease, and vascular disease were common in both PWS and non-PWS hospitalizations. While coding for obesity is known to be poor in the NIS overall [<xref rid=""R1"" ref-type=""bibr"">Al Kazzi et al., 2015</xref>], the rate of obesity in PWS patients in this sample (47.5%) is higher than that described in survey studies assessing for COVID-19 among PWS patients [<xref rid=""R10"" ref-type=""bibr"">Coupaye et al., 2021</xref>; <xref rid=""R40"" ref-type=""bibr"">Whittington et al., 2022</xref>]. As a result, the effects of COVID-19 on hospitalization outcomes may be mediated by these clinical variables. Due to small sample size we were unable to perform formal mediation analysis of covariates, but with larger samples this could inform the mechanism of increased disease severity among individuals with PWS and inform strategies for mitigating a portion of this risk. The COVID-19 pandemic had complex effects on individuals with PWS resulting from its significant impact on educational, social, and healthcare access. Evidence suggests that individuals with PWS can benefit from strict dietary control in specialist group home settings [<xref rid=""R28"" ref-type=""bibr"">Mastey Ben-Yehuda et al., 2024</xref>], with pandemic-related closures affecting access to these placements in some regions. Survey studies in Germany [<xref rid=""R29"" ref-type=""bibr"">Mohr et al., 2021</xref>], France [<xref rid=""R30"" ref-type=""bibr"">Mosbah et al., 2021</xref>], and Italy [<xref rid=""R3"" ref-type=""bibr"">Baietto et al., 2023</xref>] have indicated conflicting impacts of lockdowns on clinically-relevant outcomes including weight and mental health, which may be explained by differences in lockdown protocols and baseline treatment in different regions. As a result, the optimal care for individuals with PWS for any future pandemics must balance potential risks from disruptions of routine with potential risks of infection to PWS patients who may be at high risk of severe complications. By utilizing a large, nationally-representative data source covering hospitalizations across the US regardless of payor, this study provides evidence of clinical care for individuals with PWS without requiring active participation of study participants. This enhances the generalizability of these findings. Prior validation studies have demonstrated excellent reliability of the administrative claim code for COVID-19[<xref rid=""R42"" ref-type=""bibr"">Zhong et al., 2021</xref>], which means that this study should capture most episodes of inpatient care for COVID-19 infection during the study period, with 2021 data being the most recent that are available. One key limitation of the study is potential errors in coding for PWS using the Q87.11 code, which came into clinical use in 2019. As a result, any errors in PWS diagnosis or in coding for the disorder would bias results here. As a result, validation of the Q87.11 code is a critical next step in administrative claims research for PWS. Additionally, the single Q87.11 code does not distinguish between genetic subtypes of PWS and so this study is unable to inform potential clinical differences between subgroups of PWS. Furthermore, the NIS surveys hospitalizations and not individual patients, and so if an individual is treated in more than one hospital during the study period or is re-hospitalized, that individual may appear more than once in the NIS data. Moreover, these results are from 2020 and 2021, and since that time the circulating COVID-19 virus has mutated and there have been changes in population-level immunity caused by vaccination and prior infection. As a result, further and ongoing research is needed to provide optimal treatment recommendations for individuals with PWS as the COVID-19 pandemic continues to evolve. Finally, although AIPW is designed as a means of estimating average causal effects from observational data, we note the large literature on the imperfection of replication of casual effects found in randomized trials through quasi experimental methods applied to observational data [<xref rid=""R21"" ref-type=""bibr"">Hemkens et al., 2016</xref>; <xref rid=""R4"" ref-type=""bibr"">Benson and Hartz, 2000</xref>; <xref rid=""R31"" ref-type=""bibr"">Moss et al., 2019</xref>; <xref rid=""R39"" ref-type=""bibr"">Wang et al., 2023</xref>]. In 2020 and 2021 there were 295 (95% CI: 228 to 362) hospitalizations for patients with PWS and COVID-19 in the United States. Compared to hospitalizations for those without PWS, individuals with PWS had longer length of stay, higher hospital charges, higher odds of ventilator use, and higher mortality. These results highlight severe manifestations of COVID-19 infection in individuals with PWS, warranting continued protective measures and vaccination efforts. Further research is needed to validate coding for PWS and assess the impact of evolving COVID-19 variants and population immunity on this vulnerable population.",N/A,06 9 2024
Differences in Bone Metabolism between Children with Prader–Willi Syndrome during Growth Hormone Treatment and Healthy Subjects: A Pilot Study,"Despite therapy with growth hormone (GH) in children with Prader–Willi syndrome (PWS), low bone mineral density and various orthopedic deformities have been observed often. Therefore, this study aimed to analyze bone markers, with an emphasis on vitamin K-dependent proteins (VKDPs), in normal-weight children with PWS undergoing GH therapy and a low-energy dietary intervention. Twenty-four children with PWS and 30 healthy children of the same age were included. Serum concentrations of bone alkaline phosphatase (BALP), osteocalcin (OC), carboxylated-OC (Gla-OC), undercarboxylated-OC (Glu-OC), periostin, osteopontin, osteoprotegerin (OPG), sclerostin, C-terminal telopeptide of type I collagen (CTX-I), and insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I) were determined using immunoenzymatic methods. OC levels and the OC/CTX-I ratios were lower in children with PWS than in healthy children (<italic toggle=""yes"">p</italic> = 0.011, <italic toggle=""yes"">p</italic> = 0.006, respectively). Glu-OC concentrations were lower (<italic toggle=""yes"">p</italic> = 0.002), but Gla-OC and periostin concentrations were higher in patients with PWS compared with the controls (<italic toggle=""yes"">p</italic> = 0.005, <italic toggle=""yes"">p</italic> < 0.001, respectively). The relationships between IGF-I and OC (<italic toggle=""yes"">p</italic> = 0.013), Gla-OC (<italic toggle=""yes"">p</italic> = 0.042), and the OC/CTX-I ratio (<italic toggle=""yes"">p</italic> = 0.017) were significant after adjusting for age in children with PWS. Bone turnover disorders in children with PWS may result from impaired bone formation due to the lower concentrations of OC and the OC/CTX-I ratio. The altered profile of OC forms with elevated periostin concentrations may indicate more intensive carboxylation processes of VKDPs in these patients. The detailed relationships between the GH/IGF-I axis and bone metabolism markers, particularly VKDPs, in children with PWS requires further research. ","Prader–Willi syndrome (PWS) is a rare congenital neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by hyperphagia, growth hormone (GH) deficiency, short stature, low bone mineral density, and various orthopedic deformities, including scoliosis, kyphosis, hip dysplasia, and flat feet. Both adolescents and adults with PWS show a high prevalence of osteoporosis and fractures [<xref rid=""B1-ijms-25-09159"" ref-type=""bibr"">1</xref>]. In children, PWS is associated with disruptions in the growth hormone axis and bone turnover, potentially impacting bone mass in later life [<xref rid=""B2-ijms-25-09159"" ref-type=""bibr"">2</xref>]. However, the exact mechanisms underlying bone disturbances in PWS remain unclear. Notably, while some studies suggest that GH treatment improves bone mineral density (BMD) in PWS patients [<xref rid=""B3-ijms-25-09159"" ref-type=""bibr"">3</xref>], others report a gradual decline in the BMD standard deviation score (BMD-SDS) despite long-term GH therapy [<xref rid=""B4-ijms-25-09159"" ref-type=""bibr"">4</xref>,<xref rid=""B5-ijms-25-09159"" ref-type=""bibr"">5</xref>]. Osteocalcin (OC) and periostin are vitamin K-dependent proteins (VKDPs) critical to both bone and vascular tissues. Their biological functions rely on a vitamin K-dependent post-translational modification, where specific glutamic acid (Glu) residues are converted into gamma-carboxyglutamic acid (Gla) residues [<xref rid=""B6-ijms-25-09159"" ref-type=""bibr"">6</xref>]. Periostin—an extracellular matrix protein primarily expressed by osteoblasts and osteocytes—enhances osteoblast differentiation and proliferation, inhibits β-catenin degradation via sclerostin Wnt signaling, and promotes collagen cross-linking through lysyl oxidase activation [<xref rid=""B7-ijms-25-09159"" ref-type=""bibr"">7</xref>]. Elevated serum periostin levels have been linked to higher fracture risk in postmenopausal women [<xref rid=""B8-ijms-25-09159"" ref-type=""bibr"">8</xref>]. In bone formation, osteocalcin plays a pivotal role in organizing the bone extracellular matrix and exists in two forms: carboxylated osteocalcin (Gla-OC) and undercarboxylated osteocalcin (Glu-OC) [<xref rid=""B9-ijms-25-09159"" ref-type=""bibr"">9</xref>]. Osteocalcin’s Gla residues confer a high affinity for Ca<sup>2+</sup> and hydroxyapatite in the mineralized bone matrix. The undercarboxylated form, which is biologically active, is released from osteoblast secretion and partly from osteoclastic bone resorption. The ratio of circulating carboxylated to undercarboxylated osteocalcin reflects vitamin K status [<xref rid=""B10-ijms-25-09159"" ref-type=""bibr"">10</xref>]. Additionally, osteopontin (OPN)—another key non-collagenous protein in the bone extracellular matrix—plays multiple roles in bone metabolism by regulating bone size and density [<xref rid=""B11-ijms-25-09159"" ref-type=""bibr"">11</xref>]. OPN promotes osteoclast adhesion to the bone matrix, thus regulating bone resorption. Its levels are significantly higher in children compared with adults, and increased in obese children relative to their lean counterparts [<xref rid=""B12-ijms-25-09159"" ref-type=""bibr"">12</xref>,<xref rid=""B13-ijms-25-09159"" ref-type=""bibr"">13</xref>]. Osteoprotegerin (OPG) and sclerostin are other important markers in bone metabolism, involved in the RANK/RANKL/OPG and Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathways, respectively [<xref rid=""B14-ijms-25-09159"" ref-type=""bibr"">14</xref>,<xref rid=""B15-ijms-25-09159"" ref-type=""bibr"">15</xref>]. Conflicting results regarding bone formation and resorption markers have been observed in patients with PWS. Higher or unchanged bone turnover rates were found with low BMD and bone mineral content (BMC) values in obese adults with PWS without GH supplementation [<xref rid=""B16-ijms-25-09159"" ref-type=""bibr"">16</xref>,<xref rid=""B17-ijms-25-09159"" ref-type=""bibr"">17</xref>]. Other authors observed lower osteocalcin levels in association with a higher incidence of osteopenia and osteoporosis in overweight adults with PWS [<xref rid=""B18-ijms-25-09159"" ref-type=""bibr"">18</xref>]. In youth with PWS, lower BMC and BMD values together with low bone alkaline phosphatase (BALP) levels but unchanged C-terminal telopeptide of type I collagen (CTX-I) levels were observed [<xref rid=""B19-ijms-25-09159"" ref-type=""bibr"">19</xref>]. However, other studies on the RANK/RANKL/OPG and Wnt/ß-catenin signaling pathways in children with PWS have shown high bone turnover, which may be responsible for the altered BMD in these patients [<xref rid=""B5-ijms-25-09159"" ref-type=""bibr"">5</xref>,<xref rid=""B20-ijms-25-09159"" ref-type=""bibr"">20</xref>]. Currently, the treatment of children with PWS syndrome includes early treatment with GH, dietary recommendations, and behavioral intervention [<xref rid=""B2-ijms-25-09159"" ref-type=""bibr"">2</xref>]. Despite improvements in the outcome of PWS patients, skeletal disorders remain a clinical problem. There is a lack of data on bone metabolism markers, including VKDPs, in children with PWS. Therefore, this study aimed to analyze biochemical bone markers, with particular emphasis on vitamin K-dependent proteins, in normal-weight children with PWS undergoing GH therapy and low-energy dietary intervention compared with healthy normal-weight children. <xref rid=""ijms-25-09159-t001"" ref-type=""table"">Table 1</xref> shows similar values of anthropometric parameters such as weight, height, BMI, BMI Z-score and fat mass in children with PWS and in healthy children. Lower values of total body less head-BMD (TBLH-BMD) (<italic toggle=""yes"">p</italic> = 0.018) and TBLH-BMD Z-score (<italic toggle=""yes"">p</italic> = 0.044) were found in children with PWS than in healthy children (<xref rid=""ijms-25-09159-t001"" ref-type=""table"">Table 1</xref>). By analyzing the biochemical markers of bone turnover, we found similar values of BALP in both studied groups, but the levels of OC and the OC/CTX-I ratio were lower in children with PWS than in healthy children (<italic toggle=""yes"">p</italic> = 0.011, <italic toggle=""yes"">p</italic> = 0.006, respectively) (<xref rid=""ijms-25-09159-t002"" ref-type=""table"">Table 2</xref>, <xref rid=""ijms-25-09159-f001"" ref-type=""fig"">Figure 1</xref>). We found an altered profile of osteocalcin forms in patients compared with the controls. The Gla-OC concentrations were higher by about 30% (<italic toggle=""yes"">p</italic> = 0.005), but the Glu-OC concentrations were lower by about 30% (<italic toggle=""yes"">p</italic> = 0.002) in children with PWS than in healthy children. Hence, the percentage of Gla-OC was significantly higher in patients compared with the controls (<italic toggle=""yes"">p</italic> < 0.001). The periostin concentrations were 1.5-fold higher in these patients in comparison with healthy subjects (<italic toggle=""yes"">p</italic> < 0.001). Higher concentrations of OPN were also observed in patients with PWS (<italic toggle=""yes"">p</italic> = 0.032). No differences for CTX-I, sclerostin, and OPG concentrations were found between the studied groups. The values of insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I) and the IGF-I/total-IGF-binding protein-3 (t-IGFBP-3) molar ratio were significantly higher in children with PWS than in the controls (<italic toggle=""yes"">p</italic> = 0.002; <italic toggle=""yes"">p</italic> < 0.001, respectively). Concentrations of 25-hydroxyvitamin D were higher in patients by about 50% (<italic toggle=""yes"">p</italic> < 0.001) compared with healthy children. Similar serum concentrations of parathyroid hormone (PTH), calcium, phosphorus, and magnesium were found in both studied groups. Daily energy intake and the percentage of Estimated Energy Requirement (EER) were lower in children with PWS in comparison with healthy children by about 40% (<italic toggle=""yes"">p</italic> < 0.001) and 20% (<italic toggle=""yes"">p</italic> < 0.001), respectively (<xref rid=""ijms-25-09159-t003"" ref-type=""table"">Table 3</xref>). The percentage of energy from protein was higher (<italic toggle=""yes"">p</italic> < 0.001) but daily protein intake, including animal and plant proteins, was similar in both studied groups. The proportion of fat in the daily energy intake and daily fat intake were lower (<italic toggle=""yes"">p</italic> = 0.041; <italic toggle=""yes"">p</italic> = 0.001, respectively) in children with PWS than in the controls. The proportion of carbohydrates in the daily energy intake was similar in both studied groups, but daily carbohydrate intake was lower (<italic toggle=""yes"">p</italic> = 0.001) in patients in comparison with healthy children. The diet of children with PWS contained a higher intake of vitamin D (<italic toggle=""yes"">p</italic> < 0.001), calcium (<italic toggle=""yes"">p</italic> < 0.001), and phosphorus (<italic toggle=""yes"">p</italic> = 0.028) than that of healthy children. The percentage of Adequate Intake (AI) for vitamin D and the percentage of Estimated Average Requirement (EAR) for calcium, phosphorus, and magnesium intake were also significantly higher in patients than in the controls (<italic toggle=""yes"">p</italic> < 0.001; <italic toggle=""yes"">p</italic> < 0.001; <italic toggle=""yes"">p</italic> = 0.039; <italic toggle=""yes"">p</italic> = 0.027, respectively).  We used partial correlation to analyze associations between osteocalcin forms, periostin and other bone turnover markers in children with PWS and in healthy children after adjusting for age (<xref rid=""ijms-25-09159-t004"" ref-type=""table"">Table 4</xref>). We observed positive correlations between concentrations of osteocalcin and both forms of osteocalcin—Glu-OC and Gla-OC—in children with PWS (<italic toggle=""yes"">p</italic> = 0.002; <italic toggle=""yes"">p</italic> = 0.019, respectively). In the patient group, we obtained a positive correlation between concentrations of Gla-OC and percentage of Gla-OC (<italic toggle=""yes"">p</italic> = 0.001). We also found a positive correlation between the OC/CTX-I ratio and Glu-OC concentrations in this group (<italic toggle=""yes"">p</italic> = 0.035). Positive correlations between periostin and OC (<italic toggle=""yes"">p</italic> = 0.023), Gla-OC (<italic toggle=""yes"">p</italic> = 0.040), the OC/CTX-I ratio (<italic toggle=""yes"">p</italic> = 0.005), and OPG (<italic toggle=""yes"">p</italic> = 0.017) were also observed in patients with PWS.  In healthy children, similar to the group with PWS, we also observed positive correlations between osteocalcin and both forms of osteocalcin—Glu-OC and Gla-OC (<italic toggle=""yes"">p</italic> < 0.001; <italic toggle=""yes"">p</italic> = 0.002, respectively). We did not find any associations between Gla-OC concentrations and the percentage of Gla-OC in the control group (<italic toggle=""yes"">p</italic> = 0.080). The OC/CTX-I ratio correlated positively with Glu-OC in this group (<italic toggle=""yes"">p</italic> = 0.001). However, opposite to children with PWS, we also found a negative correlation between this ratio and the percentage of Gla-OC (<italic toggle=""yes"">p</italic> = 0.012) in the control group. In healthy children, we also observed positive correlations between BALP activity and Glu-OC (<italic toggle=""yes"">p</italic> = 0.049) and negative correlations between BALP activity and the percentage of Gla-OC (<italic toggle=""yes"">p</italic> = 0.044). No significant correlations were found between periostin and other bone markers in this group.  To adjust for age, the bivariate relationships between IGF-I and bone metabolism parameters, multivariate quantile regression models were estimated, including IGF-I and age as the independent variables and a single bone metabolism parameter as the dependent variable (<xref rid=""ijms-25-09159-t005"" ref-type=""table"">Table 5</xref>). The relationships between IGF-I and OC (<italic toggle=""yes"">p</italic> = 0.013), Gla-OC (<italic toggle=""yes"">p</italic> = 0.042) and the OC/CTX-I ratio (<italic toggle=""yes"">p</italic> = 0.017) were significant after adjustment for age in patients with PWS. In healthy children, the relationship between IGF-I and Gla-OC was only significant after adjustment (<italic toggle=""yes"">p</italic> = 0.008). No associations were obtained between the IGF-I/t-IGFBP-3 molar ratio and bone metabolism parameters in both studied groups. Current therapeutic strategies in PWS include early therapy with growth hormone (GH) in children to improve growth and body composition [<xref rid=""B23-ijms-25-09159"" ref-type=""bibr"">23</xref>]. Baker et al. [<xref rid=""B3-ijms-25-09159"" ref-type=""bibr"">3</xref>] demonstrated that the BMD of total body and the lumbar spine were stable in prepubertal children with PWS during GH therapy but decreased in adolescents. However, reduced lumbar spine BMD in children with PWS receiving GH was found by Brunetti et al. [<xref rid=""B5-ijms-25-09159"" ref-type=""bibr"">5</xref>]. In addition, Oto et al. [<xref rid=""B4-ijms-25-09159"" ref-type=""bibr"">4</xref>] observed that total body BMD of pediatric patients with PWS decreased gradually despite GH treatment. Our results also show lower TBLH BMD and TBLHBMD Z-score values in prepubertal normal-weight children with PWS during GH therapy and dietary intervention than in healthy children. In addition, we observed changes in the profile of biochemical bone turnover markers in the studied patients in comparison with healthy subjects. The lower OC concentrations and OC/CTX-I ratio suggest that bone turnover disorders may result from impaired bone formation in children with PWS. We also found higher concentrations of osteopontin in these patients, which is produced together with osteocalcin during bone formation in the late phase of mineralization. OPN expression is strongly dependent on PTH and proinflammatory cytokines [<xref rid=""B24-ijms-25-09159"" ref-type=""bibr"">24</xref>]. Higher levels of this protein have been observed in osteoporosis, osteoarthritis, obesity, and diabetes [<xref rid=""B25-ijms-25-09159"" ref-type=""bibr"">25</xref>,<xref rid=""B26-ijms-25-09159"" ref-type=""bibr"">26</xref>,<xref rid=""B27-ijms-25-09159"" ref-type=""bibr"">27</xref>]. Despite unchanged PTH levels and normal body weight in our children with PWS, we observed higher OPN levels in these patients, which may predispose them to increased bone resorption. Furthermore, in our previous study [<xref rid=""B28-ijms-25-09159"" ref-type=""bibr"">28</xref>] we found associations between proinflammatory adipokines and the prooxidant state in non-obese children with PWS, which may also influence OPN levels in these patients [<xref rid=""B29-ijms-25-09159"" ref-type=""bibr"">29</xref>]. Studies concerning bone markers in children and adolescents with PWS are rather scarce. Rubin et al. [<xref rid=""B19-ijms-25-09159"" ref-type=""bibr"">19</xref>] obtained unchanged BALP and CTX-I values in youths with PWS during pharmacotherapy and exercises compared with youths without PWS. However, Brunetti et al. [<xref rid=""B5-ijms-25-09159"" ref-type=""bibr"">5</xref>] found high osteocalcin levels and low 25(OH)D levels associated with the reduced BMD in children with PWS. These authors also observed the occurrence of higher bone turnover and increase in the RANKL/OPG ratio in the studied patients. Brunetti et al. [<xref rid=""B20-ijms-25-09159"" ref-type=""bibr"">20</xref>] suggest that vitamin D supplementation could improve BMD in children with PWS. In our study, children with PWS were supplemented with vitamin D, and serum concentrations of 25(OH)D were significantly higher in patients than in healthy children. In addition, children with PWS had not only a higher intake of vitamin D but also a higher percentage of EAR for calcium, phosphorus, and magnesium intake than the control group. However, we found lower values of total osteocalcin as well as alterations in the profile of OC forms with higher Gla-OC concentrations but lower Glu-OC concentrations in children with PWS compared with healthy subjects. Gla-OC is a marker of mature osteoblasts and may interact with hydroxyapatite crystals, modulating its growth, but elevated serum Glu-OC levels are associated with lower BMD, increased osteoporosis, fracture risk, and vitamin K deficiency [<xref rid=""B30-ijms-25-09159"" ref-type=""bibr"">30</xref>,<xref rid=""B31-ijms-25-09159"" ref-type=""bibr"">31</xref>]. The exact role of these proteins in bone metabolism is not entirely clear. Ziemińska et al. [<xref rid=""B32-ijms-25-09159"" ref-type=""bibr"">32</xref>] observed an unfavorable role of Gla-OC in the mineralization of bones in chronic kidney disease conditions. According to other authors, Gla-OC may act as an inhibitor of bone mineralization [<xref rid=""B33-ijms-25-09159"" ref-type=""bibr"">33</xref>,<xref rid=""B34-ijms-25-09159"" ref-type=""bibr"">34</xref>]. In our study, the higher percentage of Gla-OC and low Glu-OC concentrations may indicate higher levels of serum vitamin K and more intensive carboxylation processes of vitamin K-dependent proteins in children with PWS. Moreover, these alterations in the profile of OC forms and lower OC concentrations were obtained together with lower bone densities in these children in comparison with healthy subjects. It seems that the role of OC and OC forms in bone formation disorders in children with PWS cannot be ruled out. Furthermore, decreased Glu-OC concentrations may be an early symptom of metabolic syndrome and insulin resistance in humans and mice [<xref rid=""B35-ijms-25-09159"" ref-type=""bibr"">35</xref>,<xref rid=""B36-ijms-25-09159"" ref-type=""bibr"">36</xref>]. Takaya et al. [<xref rid=""B37-ijms-25-09159"" ref-type=""bibr"">37</xref>] observed decreased Glu-OC concentrations in non-obese children with type 2 diabetes mellitus and suggested a role of this protein in the pathophysiology of diabetes. Our previous results showed similar values of glucose and proinsulin in non-obese children with PWS during dietary treatment and in healthy subjects [<xref rid=""B22-ijms-25-09159"" ref-type=""bibr"">22</xref>]. However, the low Glu-OC concentrations observed in these patients may be one of the factors predisposing them to the development of diabetes in the future. Particularly, when an appropriate low-calorie diet is not followed, individuals with PWS display hyperphagia, develop obesity, and a number of complications such as dyslipidemia, metabolic syndrome, glucose metabolism disorders, and type 2 diabetes [<xref rid=""B38-ijms-25-09159"" ref-type=""bibr"">38</xref>]. Periostin, a protein also dependent on vitamin K, is an important regulator of collagen cross-linking, and loss of periostin changes the bone microarchitecture and reduces bone strength and turnover [<xref rid=""B39-ijms-25-09159"" ref-type=""bibr"">39</xref>]. Higher serum periostin concentration is associated with higher fracture risk in postmenopausal women [<xref rid=""B8-ijms-25-09159"" ref-type=""bibr"">8</xref>,<xref rid=""B40-ijms-25-09159"" ref-type=""bibr"">40</xref>] and may be used as a marker for spinal degenerative diseases [<xref rid=""B41-ijms-25-09159"" ref-type=""bibr"">41</xref>]. Other authors also observed increased periostin levels in fractures during the early healing phase, suggesting the participation of this protein in bone repair processes [<xref rid=""B42-ijms-25-09159"" ref-type=""bibr"">42</xref>]. According to Chapurlat et al. [<xref rid=""B43-ijms-25-09159"" ref-type=""bibr"">43</xref>], higher concentrations of periostin may reflect adaptation of periosteum cell metabolic activity in response to different disorders to maintain a steady state of skeletal system quality. In our study, we observed higher concentrations of periostin in children with PWS than in the healthy controls and significant positive relations with osteocalcin and Gla-OC, which may be the result of increased protein carboxylation processes dependent on vitamin K. Additionally, periostin stimulates the Wnt signaling pathway, inhibiting the expression of sclerostin to mediate the anabolic response of the bone [<xref rid=""B7-ijms-25-09159"" ref-type=""bibr"">7</xref>]. We did not find differences in sclerostin and OPG concentrations between children with PWS and the controls. OPG has been shown to reduce osteoclast number, which affects the rate of bone resorption [<xref rid=""B44-ijms-25-09159"" ref-type=""bibr"">44</xref>]. Previous studies have shown that PTH can affect OPG expression [<xref rid=""B45-ijms-25-09159"" ref-type=""bibr"">45</xref>], but in our study unchanged PTH and OPG values in children with PWS were found. Furthermore, we observed a significant correlation between OPG and periostin in our patients. Some authors showed positive associations between these markers during tooth eruption in mice [<xref rid=""B46-ijms-25-09159"" ref-type=""bibr"">46</xref>] as well as during cell adhesion to implantable materials and osteoblastic differentiation on implant surfaces [<xref rid=""B47-ijms-25-09159"" ref-type=""bibr"">47</xref>]. It seems that periostin together with OPG may play a compensatory role in response to bone metabolic disorders in patients with PWS. In our study, we observed higher concentrations of IGF-I and the IGF-I/t-IGFBP-3 ratio in children with PWS during GH treatment in comparison with healthy subjects. Similar results were obtained by Baker et al. [<xref rid=""B48-ijms-25-09159"" ref-type=""bibr"">48</xref>] and Gaddas et al. [<xref rid=""B49-ijms-25-09159"" ref-type=""bibr"">49</xref>] in GH-treated PWS children who had elevated serum concentrations of IGF-I and IGFBP-3 in the upper normal range. Additionally, an increase in IGF-I concentrations and a relatively smaller increase in IGFBP-3 concentrations were observed in these patients, which may result in a greater amount of free, biologically available IGF-I in the circulation [<xref rid=""B49-ijms-25-09159"" ref-type=""bibr"">49</xref>]. Animal models and human studies showed that IGF-I deficiency as well as IGF-I excess may cause disorders in bone metabolism, resulting in alterations in bone mass and skeletal development [<xref rid=""B50-ijms-25-09159"" ref-type=""bibr"">50</xref>,<xref rid=""B51-ijms-25-09159"" ref-type=""bibr"">51</xref>]. We observed positive relations between IGF-I and Gla-OC in both studied groups and additionally between IGF-I and OC as well as the OC/CTX-I ratio in children with PWS. However, the role of increased IGF-I concentrations in bone mineral density and skeletal development in patients with PWS is still unclear. Therefore, the relation between the GH/IGF-I axis and bone metabolism parameters, especially vitamin K-dependent proteins, requires further research. The present study had several limitations. First, we analyzed bone turnover markers and bone density in a small group of normal-weight children with PWS, but this syndrome is a rare genetic disease. However, all children in the study group were treated with GH and a low-energy diet and were within the normal range in terms of BMI. Secondly, we presented a cross-sectional study without a prospective longitudinal analysis, which is needed to examine the relationship between bone metabolism parameters and clinical outcomes in children with PWS. However, this is the first study investigating bone turnover markers and vitamin K-dependent proteins in children with PWS. Thirdly, we did not directly measure blood concentrations of vitamin K and its metabolites in these patients. According to many authors, the percentage of Gla-OC or the Gla-OC/Glu-OC ratio may also be useful in determining vitamin K status [<xref rid=""B10-ijms-25-09159"" ref-type=""bibr"">10</xref>]. Finally, we know that myokines—i.e., factors released by muscle tissue—have a significant impact on bone metabolism. These factors can be released by skeletal muscle into the circulatory system in response to mechanical stress and/or metabolic changes. Fibroblast growth factor-2 (FGF-2) and irisin stimulate bone growth by increasing bone formation. In contrast, bone resorption can be modified by the action of myostatin and fibroblast growth factor-21 (FGF-21). Therefore, our further research will focus on the influence of selected myokines on the processes of bone formation and resorption in children with PWS.  In this study, bone turnover disorders in normal-weight children with PWS undergoing GH treatment and dietary intervention may result from impaired bone formation due to the lower concentrations of OC and the OC/CTX-I ratio. Furthermore, we observed associations between Gla-OC and IGF-I concentrations in children with PWS. The altered profile of OC forms with a higher percentage of Gla-OC, along with elevated periostin concentrations, may indicate more intensive carboxylation processes of vitamin K-dependent proteins in these patients.",N/A,23 8 2024
Novel Case of Prader–Willi Syndrome and Ebstein's Anomaly: Implications for Complex Care Management,"We present a patient with a complex phenotype including diagnoses of Ebstein's anomaly and Prader–Willi syndrome (PWS) as well as additional congenital anomalies and genetic variants with potential clinical effects. This is the first reported case of both diagnoses present in the same patient. The diagnosis of Ebstein's anomaly was made on prenatal ultrasound. She presented with neonatal hypotonia, feeding problems, and dysmorphic features, followed by later onset weight gain, leading to a diagnosis of PWS. Further evaluations revealed Blaschkoid hyperpigmentation, laryngeal cleft, and pigmentary retinopathy. Whole exome sequencing determined a likely pathogenic variant in alkaline phosphatase gene and several mitochondrial DNA variants. We discuss the known genetic mechanisms of PWS and compare them to the heterogenous genetic associations of Ebstein's anomaly. The standard of care treatment for PWS is growth hormone therapy, which is associated with right-sided heart failure risks. This case illustrates the need to complete the diagnostic work up in all patients, as well as the necessity of a multidisciplinary approach for optimal outcomes.",Full text not available in PMC,N/A,10 10 2022
Generation of isogenic models of Angelman syndrome and Prader-Willi syndrome in CRISPR/Cas9-engineered human embryonic stem cells,"Angelman syndrome (AS) and Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS), two distinct neurodevelopmental disorders, result from loss of expression from imprinted genes in the chromosome 15q11-13 locus most commonly caused by a megabase-scale deletion on either the maternal or paternal allele, respectively. Each occurs at an approximate incidence of 1/15,000 to 1/30,000 live births and has a range of debilitating phenotypes. Patient-derived induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) have been valuable tools to understand human-relevant gene regulation at this locus and have contributed to the development of therapeutic approaches for AS. Nonetheless, gaps remain in our understanding of how these deletions contribute to dysregulation and phenotypes of AS and PWS. Variability across cell lines due to donor differences, reprogramming methods, and genetic background make it challenging to fill these gaps in knowledge without substantially increasing the number of cell lines used in the analyses. Isogenic cell lines that differ only by the genetic mutation causing the disease can ease this burden without requiring such a large number of cell lines. Here, we describe the development of isogenic human embryonic stem cell (hESC) lines modeling the most common genetic subtypes of AS and PWS. These lines allow for a facile interrogation of allele-specific gene regulation at the chromosome 15q11-q13 locus. Additionally, these lines are an important resource to identify and test targeted therapeutic approaches for patients with AS and PWS.","Deletions of the maternal or paternal alleles of chromosome 15q11-q13, respectively, cause Angelman syndrome (AS [OMIM #105830]) and Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS [OMIM #176270]).

Clinical features of AS include seizures, intellectual disability, absent speech, ataxia, and characteristic happy demeanor [<xref rid=""pone.0311565.ref004"" ref-type=""bibr"">4</xref>]. Other common features include microcephaly, abnormal EEG, sleep disturbances, strabismus, and, in cases where <italic toggle=""yes"">OCA2</italic> is deleted, hypopigmentation [<xref rid=""pone.0311565.ref005"" ref-type=""bibr"">5</xref>].

While PWS is generally thought to be a contiguous gene disorder, recently described microdeletion cases encompassing just the <italic toggle=""yes"">SNORD116</italic> cluster highlight its crucial role in PWS pathophysiology [<xref rid=""pone.0311565.ref011"" ref-type=""bibr"">11</xref>]. Another rare neurodevelopmental disorder which shares some phenotypes with PWS is Schaaf-Yang syndrome (SYS), which is caused by mutations in <italic toggle=""yes"">MAGEL2</italic>, a protein-coding gene within the 15q11-q13 locus [<xref rid=""pone.0311565.ref012"" ref-type=""bibr"">12</xref>]. AS and PWS can be caused by a few different molecular mechanisms, but the most common is a large deletion, affecting ~70% of patients [<xref rid=""pone.0311565.ref013"" ref-type=""bibr"">13</xref>, <xref rid=""pone.0311565.ref014"" ref-type=""bibr"">14</xref>]. The chromosome 15q11-q13 locus harbors intrachromosomal segmental duplications that can misalign during meiosis to generate these “common” large deletions within this chromosomal region [<xref rid=""pone.0311565.ref015"" ref-type=""bibr"">15</xref>]. Many of the genes in this region are governed by genomic imprinting, a phenomenon in which genes are expressed exclusively from one parental allele, rendering them functionally haploid. Deletion of single copies of the expressed alleles of these imprinted genes cause their full loss of function. Genomic imprinting at chromosome 15q11-q13 is established in the germline via differential methylation at the Prader-Willi Syndrome Imprinting Center (PWS-IC) [<xref rid=""pone.0311565.ref016"" ref-type=""bibr"">16</xref>–<xref rid=""pone.0311565.ref018"" ref-type=""bibr"">18</xref>]. The PWS-IC is methylated on the maternal allele and unmethylated on the paternal allele. This region on the unmethylated paternal allele serves as the canonical promoter for <italic toggle=""yes"">SNRPN</italic> transcript which is exclusively expressed from the paternally inherited allele. The <italic toggle=""yes"">SNRPN</italic> transcript is bi-cistronic, encoding for <italic toggle=""yes"">SNURF</italic> and <italic toggle=""yes"">SNRPN</italic> [<xref rid=""pone.0311565.ref019"" ref-type=""bibr"">19</xref>], and also codes a long non-coding RNA (lncRNA), <italic toggle=""yes"">SNHG14</italic> (reviewed by Ariyanfar & Good, 2022 [<xref rid=""pone.0311565.ref020"" ref-type=""bibr"">20</xref>]). <italic toggle=""yes"">SNHG14</italic> can be divided into two units, proximal and distal, based on its expression pattern. The proximal unit is broadly expressed across multiple tissue types and includes <italic toggle=""yes"">SNURF-SNRPN</italic>, <italic toggle=""yes"">SNORD107</italic>, <italic toggle=""yes"">SNORD64</italic>, <italic toggle=""yes"">SNORD108</italic>, <italic toggle=""yes"">IPW</italic>, <italic toggle=""yes"">SNORD109A</italic>, and <italic toggle=""yes"">SNORD116</italic>. The distal unit is exclusively expressed in neural cell types and includes <italic toggle=""yes"">SNORD115</italic>, <italic toggle=""yes"">SNORD109B</italic>, and <italic toggle=""yes"">UBE3A-ATS</italic> [<xref rid=""pone.0311565.ref021"" ref-type=""bibr"">21</xref>, <xref rid=""pone.0311565.ref022"" ref-type=""bibr"">22</xref>]. The <italic toggle=""yes"">UBE3A-ATS</italic> portion of the transcript is responsible for silencing the paternal copy of <italic toggle=""yes"">UBE3A</italic> [<xref rid=""pone.0311565.ref023"" ref-type=""bibr"">23</xref>], thus expression of <italic toggle=""yes"">UBE3A</italic> occurs exclusively from the maternal allele in neurons. Many of the encoded RNAs are of the small nucleolar RNA (snoRNA) class, which are generally thought to be processed by exonucleolytic trimming from the introns of a host gene [<xref rid=""pone.0311565.ref024"" ref-type=""bibr"">24</xref>]. <italic toggle=""yes"">SNORD116</italic> and <italic toggle=""yes"">SNORD115</italic> are two clusters of snoRNAs, with 30 individual snoRNA copies and 48 individual snoRNA copies respectively. <italic toggle=""yes"">SNORD116</italic> can be further subdivided into three subgroups: Group I (<italic toggle=""yes"">SNOG1</italic>, <italic toggle=""yes"">SNORD116-1</italic> to <italic toggle=""yes"">SNORD116-9</italic>), Group II (<italic toggle=""yes"">SNOG2</italic>, <italic toggle=""yes"">SNORD116-10</italic> to <italic toggle=""yes"">SNORD116-24</italic>), and Group III (<italic toggle=""yes"">SNOG3</italic>, <italic toggle=""yes"">SNORD116-25</italic> to <italic toggle=""yes"">SNORD116-30</italic>) [<xref rid=""pone.0311565.ref021"" ref-type=""bibr"">21</xref>, <xref rid=""pone.0311565.ref025"" ref-type=""bibr"">25</xref>]. Protein-coding genes <italic toggle=""yes"">MKRN3</italic>, <italic toggle=""yes"">MAGEL2</italic>, and <italic toggle=""yes"">NDN</italic>, are positioned upstream of the PWS-IC and are exclusively expressed from the paternally inherited allele. The generation of patient-derived induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) has led to increased understanding of human gene regulation at the chromosome 15q11-q13 locus [<xref rid=""pone.0311565.ref026"" ref-type=""bibr"">26</xref>–<xref rid=""pone.0311565.ref029"" ref-type=""bibr"">29</xref>]. However, variability in the genetic background and epigenetic reprogramming between different iPSC lines make it difficult to study the functional consequences of 15q imprinting disorders in neural cells. Here, we report the generation and characterization of isogenic chromosome 15q11-q13 megabase-scale deletions to model the most common genetic subtypes of AS and PWS. These models were built in the well-characterized and user-friendly H9 human embryonic stem cell (hESC) line to make use of the extensive publicly available data [<xref rid=""pone.0311565.ref030"" ref-type=""bibr"">30</xref>, <xref rid=""pone.0311565.ref031"" ref-type=""bibr"">31</xref>] and robust neuronal differentiation [<xref rid=""pone.0311565.ref032"" ref-type=""bibr"">32</xref>, <xref rid=""pone.0311565.ref033"" ref-type=""bibr"">33</xref>]. The use of isogenic cell lines provides a more rigorous approach to investigate cellular deficits in disease models. These cell lines are well-suited for identifying quantitative molecular and physiological phenotypes, increasing confidence that observed differences between disease and control cells are due to the genetic disorders.  To generate isogenic models of AS and PWS, we sought to recapitulate deletions frequently present in AS or PWS patients. Examination of deletions deposited in ClinVar and DECIPHER [<xref rid=""pone.0311565.ref041"" ref-type=""bibr"">41</xref>, <xref rid=""pone.0311565.ref042"" ref-type=""bibr"">42</xref>] revealed breakpoint hotspots that coincide with repeats of <italic toggle=""yes"">GOLGA8</italic> (<xref rid=""pone.0311565.g001"" ref-type=""fig"">Fig 1</xref>). This repeated sequence described as contributing significantly to substantial instability at this locus [<xref rid=""pone.0311565.ref043"" ref-type=""bibr"">43</xref>, <xref rid=""pone.0311565.ref044"" ref-type=""bibr"">44</xref>]. Therefore we pursued targeting these segmental duplications, similar to the approach used to eliminate the Y-chromosome or trisomic chromosome 21 [<xref rid=""pone.0311565.ref045"" ref-type=""bibr"">45</xref>, <xref rid=""pone.0311565.ref046"" ref-type=""bibr"">46</xref>]. We previously used a similar CRISPR/Cas9 strategy, with guide RNAs (gRNAs) targeting <italic toggle=""yes"">GOLGA8</italic> and other repetitive sequences in chromosome 15, to evict an extra chromosome and generate an isogenic model for Duplication 15q Syndrome (Dup15q, [OMIM #608636]) [<xref rid=""pone.0311565.ref034"" ref-type=""bibr"">34</xref>]. Others have created 15q13.3 microdeletions leveraging this approach [<xref rid=""pone.0311565.ref047"" ref-type=""bibr"">47</xref>]. Building on the concepts utilized in these previous studies, we began by nucleofecting H9 hESCs with a plasmid encoding CRISPR/Cas9 and a single gRNA targeting <italic toggle=""yes"">GOLGA8</italic> repeats on chromosome 15q (<xref rid=""pone.0311565.g001"" ref-type=""fig"">Fig 1</xref>) (Methods). This gRNA is predicted to target multiple sites within chromosome 15q but is not predicted to target elsewhere in the genome. We screened clones surviving transient puromycin selection, which eliminated cells that did not receive the Cas9/gRNA plasmid, for expression of <italic toggle=""yes"">UBE3A</italic> with a TaqMan-based assay (Methods). As stem cells bi-allelically express <italic toggle=""yes"">UBE3A</italic>, cell lines harboring AS and PWS related deletions should therefore express approximately half as much <italic toggle=""yes"">UBE3A</italic> as the parent H9 line (<xref rid=""pone.0311565.g002"" ref-type=""fig"">Fig 2A</xref>). This screening method provided us with a high-throughput way to screen 126 clones from 4 separate transfections (<xref rid=""pone.0311565.s008"" ref-type=""supplementary-material"">S1 Fig</xref> and <xref rid=""pone.0311565.s010"" ref-type=""supplementary-material"">S3 Table</xref>). Three clones with reduced <italic toggle=""yes"">UBE3A</italic> expression comparable to an Angelman iPSC line (ASdel1-0) were expanded and subject to confirmatory testing. While our initial screen utilized cDNA and relative expression of <italic toggle=""yes"">UBE3A</italic>, we confirmed deletions by determining the copy number of UBE3A in genomic DNA (gDNA) extracted from our edited clones. We compared edited clones to wild type H9 samples harboring two UBE3A copies and the ASdel1-0 sample harboring only one UBE3A copy. All three clones were predicted to contain a single UBE3A copy (Methods)(<xref rid=""pone.0311565.g002"" ref-type=""fig"">Fig 2B</xref> and <xref rid=""pone.0311565.s011"" ref-type=""supplementary-material"">S4 Table</xref>). To determine the parent-of-origin of the deletions in our three cell lines, we subjected gDNA isolated from them to methylation analysis at the Prader-Willi Syndrome Imprinting Center (PWS-IC, <italic toggle=""yes"">SNRPN</italic>)(Methods). A wild type cell line will show ~50% methylation at <italic toggle=""yes"">SNRPN</italic>, as the paternal allele is unmethylated and the maternal allele is methylated. Previous analysis of patient-derived AS and PWS lines showed that, as expected, PWS deletion lines only have a methylated maternal allele and are ~100% methylated, and AS deletion lines only have an unmethylated paternal allele lacking methylation at this CpG island [<xref rid=""pone.0311565.ref026"" ref-type=""bibr"">26</xref>]. The methylation analysis indicated that two of the three clones with reduced <italic toggle=""yes"">UBE3A</italic> expression and copy number exhibited a primarily unmethylated PWS-IC resembling AS (H9Δmat15q_1 and H9Δmat15q_2) and one clone exhibited a primarily methylated PWS-IC resembling PWS (H9Δpat15q) (<xref rid=""pone.0311565.g002"" ref-type=""fig"">Fig 2C</xref> and <xref rid=""pone.0311565.s012"" ref-type=""supplementary-material"">S5 Table</xref>). To determine if the plasmid used to target the deletions might have stably integrated into the genome we screen each clone with three different amplicons. We found no evidence of guide RNA or functional Cas9 gene integration into the genomes of any of the chosen clones (<xref rid=""pone.0311565.s002"" ref-type=""supplementary-material"">S2 Fig</xref>). To determine the approximate size of the deletion, clones were further characterized by a CytoSNP analysis. This analysis revealed an ~5.8Mb deletion in the H9Δmat15q_1 line, an ~8Mb deletion in the H9Δmat15q_2 line, and two deletions totaling ~7Mb in the H9Δpat15q line (<xref rid=""pone.0311565.s003"" ref-type=""supplementary-material"">S3 Fig</xref>). The coordinates of the deletions returned from CytoSNP analysis were displayed as bedtracks in the UCSC genome browser to visually display the size of the deletions and which genes may be impacted (<xref rid=""pone.0311565.g002"" ref-type=""fig"">Fig 2D</xref>). These deletions coincided well with those observed in patients (<xref rid=""pone.0311565.s004"" ref-type=""supplementary-material"">S4 Fig</xref>), further supporting <italic toggle=""yes"">GOLGA8</italic>-driven instability as genetic mechanism leading to AS and PWS. We next sought to determine the pluripotent potential of these lines and to characterize their gene expression profile in the chromosome 15q locus as ESCs (Methods)(<xref rid=""pone.0311565.s009"" ref-type=""supplementary-material"">S2 Table</xref>). There were very few significant differences in pluripotency genes of the edited cell lines compared to the parental H9 line (<xref rid=""pone.0311565.g003"" ref-type=""fig"">Fig 3A</xref>). Additionally, we performed immunocytochemistry for Oct4 protein, which was robustly expressed in the line analyzed (<xref rid=""pone.0311565.s005"" ref-type=""supplementary-material"">S5 Fig</xref>). In lines with maternal deletions, imprinted 15q genes showed similar expression to the parental H9 line as expected (<xref rid=""pone.0311565.g003"" ref-type=""fig"">Fig 3B</xref>). In the paternal deletion line, imprinted 15q genes that are expressed exclusively from the paternal allele showed very little expression compared to the parental H9 line (<xref rid=""pone.0311565.g003"" ref-type=""fig"">Fig 3B</xref>). This is expected, as these imprinted genes are silenced on the intact maternal allele. This data supported our characterization of which allele was deleted in each cell line. Most bi-allelically expressed 15q genes within the deletion breakpoints showed approximately half of the expression of the parental H9 line (<xref rid=""pone.0311565.g003"" ref-type=""fig"">Fig 3C</xref>) excluding <italic toggle=""yes"">GABRG3</italic> which was inconclusive (<xref rid=""pone.0311565.s005"" ref-type=""supplementary-material"">S5 Fig</xref>). As differentiation into the neuronal lineage is important for studying these disorders and is crucial for verifying the imprinting status of <italic toggle=""yes"">UBE3A</italic> in neurons, we performed neuronal differentiation of all lines (Methods). All lines successfully differentiated into neurons (<xref rid=""pone.0311565.g004"" ref-type=""fig"">Fig 4A</xref> and <xref rid=""pone.0311565.s006"" ref-type=""supplementary-material"">S6 Fig</xref>). As expected, expression of neuronal genes was comparable to the wild type H9 parental line (<xref rid=""pone.0311565.g004"" ref-type=""fig"">Fig 4B</xref> and <xref rid=""pone.0311565.s006"" ref-type=""supplementary-material"">S6 Fig</xref>). Along with similar gross morphology and comparable gene expression across samples, immunocytochemistry revealed expression of neuronal proteins MAP2 and NeuN (<xref rid=""pone.0311565.s006"" ref-type=""supplementary-material"">S6 Fig</xref>). Very little expression from imprinted 15q genes was observed for the paternal deletion line (<xref rid=""pone.0311565.g004"" ref-type=""fig"">Fig 4C</xref>). For maternal deletion lines, most paternally imprinted genes are expressed comparable to that of the parental H9 line as expected, except <italic toggle=""yes"">UBE3A</italic>, which was significantly reduced (<xref rid=""pone.0311565.g004"" ref-type=""fig"">Fig 4C</xref> and <xref rid=""pone.0311565.s006"" ref-type=""supplementary-material"">S6 Fig</xref>). We considered this proof-of-concept that these isogenic AS-like cell line models are capable of imprinting <italic toggle=""yes"">UBE3A</italic> following neuronal differentiation. Bi-allelic 15q gene expression maintained a similar expression profile to that observed in ESCs, with most genes contained within the deletion showing approximately half expression compared to the parental H9 line (<xref rid=""pone.0311565.g004"" ref-type=""fig"">Fig 4D</xref> and <xref rid=""pone.0311565.s006"" ref-type=""supplementary-material"">S6 Fig</xref>). Five of the seven pluripotency genes measured show decreased expression in neurons compared to wild type ESCs, while neuronal genes show robustly increased expression compared to wild type ESCs (<xref rid=""pone.0311565.s007"" ref-type=""supplementary-material"">S7 Fig</xref>). Given that these cell lines readily differentiate into neurons, we anticipate they will provide great utility for understanding the specific role these deletions play in neurodevelopmental phenotypes of AS and PWS. While the genetic perturbations contributing to AS and PWS have been known for many years, the effect those anomalies have on the chromosome 15q locus and the genome as a whole remains unclear. Mouse models have provided key understandings about the facets of gene regulation conserved between the two species, but disease features such as the neuron-specific regulation of <italic toggle=""yes"">UBE3A</italic> imprinted expression and protein targets of UBE3A appear to be unique to humans [<xref rid=""pone.0311565.ref022"" ref-type=""bibr"">22</xref>, <xref rid=""pone.0311565.ref048"" ref-type=""bibr"">48</xref>–<xref rid=""pone.0311565.ref050"" ref-type=""bibr"">50</xref>]. Available iPSC models have been powerful tools to study these disorders as well. However, comparison of quantitative molecular phenotypes via multiomics approaches and functional studies of iPSC-derived neurons have been hampered by the variability between iPSC lines. While a prior study engineered a type I deletion modeling PWS into iPSCs through use of multiple CRISPR gRNAs [<xref rid=""pone.0311565.ref051"" ref-type=""bibr"">51</xref>], here we have described the first isogenic cell line pairs modeling the most common genetic subtypes of both AS and PWS utilizing a single CRISPR gRNA in a well-characterized H9 ESC line. We reasoned that we may be able to mimic megabase-scale deletions found in patients by targeting chromosome 15q-specific <italic toggle=""yes"">GOLGA8</italic> repeats. We took advantage of the bi-allelic expression of <italic toggle=""yes"">UBE3A</italic>, a gene included in the deleted region, in hESCs to rapidly screen for edited clones with reduced expression (<xref rid=""pone.0311565.g002"" ref-type=""fig"">Fig 2A</xref> and <xref rid=""pone.0311565.s001"" ref-type=""supplementary-material"">S1 Fig</xref>). Our rationale was that if either the maternal or paternal chromosome 15q allele was deleted in this region, we would observe approximately half the <italic toggle=""yes"">UBE3A</italic> expression compared to a wild type control. We subjected the clones with reduced <italic toggle=""yes"">UBE3A</italic> expression to a more rigorous confirmatory testing utilizing a copy number assay to determine the number of <italic toggle=""yes"">UBE3A</italic> copies present in gDNA extracted from each clone (<xref rid=""pone.0311565.g002"" ref-type=""fig"">Fig 2B</xref>). As the parent-of-origin of the deletion matters, we utilized differential methylation at the PWS-IC/<italic toggle=""yes"">SNRPN</italic> to determine which allele was deleted. The differential methylation at this site has been characterized previously in patient-derived iPSCs [<xref rid=""pone.0311565.ref026"" ref-type=""bibr"">26</xref>]. We hypothesized our isogenic models would have comparable methylation signatures to iPSC models if they harbored similar deletions, which was what we observed (<xref rid=""pone.0311565.g002"" ref-type=""fig"">Fig 2C</xref>). Confident we created deletions on either the paternal or maternal allele, we employed a CytoSNP array to determine the approximate size of the deletion. This assay leveraged microarray technology to detect copy-neutral loss of heterozygosity (LOH), absence of heterozygosity (AOH), and copy number variation (CNV) via gains or losses. While off-target editing is sometimes a concern with CRIPSR/Cas9 editing, CytoSNP analysis did not detect any copy number changes or structural rearrangements aside from the deletions on chromosome 15. Any copy number changes outside of chromosome 15 in the edited hESCs were also present in the parental H9 cell line previously characterized by the lab, supporting the isogenic nature of these cell lines (<xref rid=""pone.0311565.s003"" ref-type=""supplementary-material"">S3 Fig</xref>). Having determined the parent-of-origin and approximate size of the deletions, we wanted to ensure these edited cell lines were still pluripotent. While the expression profile of the pluripotency markers in edited cell lines did not match exactly to the wild type controls (<xref rid=""pone.0311565.g003"" ref-type=""fig"">Fig 3A</xref>), this could be caused by differences in the quality of the cultures at the time of collection. The pluripotent potential of the edited cell lines was supported by their ability to differentiate successfully into a neuronal lineage (<xref rid=""pone.0311565.g004"" ref-type=""fig"">Fig 4A</xref>). We also wanted to examine gene expression within the chromosome 15q locus. We would expect the imprinted gene expression in maternal deletion lines to be consistent with the parental wild type line, as the imprinted and unexpressed copy of each gene was deleted. We observe no significant differences in imprinted 15q gene expression in maternal deletion ESC lines, however we do notice some significant differences in imprinted genes in the H9Δmat15q_2 line in 10-week neurons (<xref rid=""pone.0311565.g004"" ref-type=""fig"">Fig 4C</xref>). We believe these differences are driven by one sample which was analyzed via qPCR at a lower concentration. We decided to include this sample in the analysis so there were three biological replicates, though further replication should be performed in future studies to determine if this variation is truly biological in nature. In contrast, we would anticipate little to no expression of the paternally expressed imprinted genes in the paternal deletion line, as the expressed copy of each gene was deleted, which was exactly what we observed (Figs <xref rid=""pone.0311565.g003"" ref-type=""fig"">3B</xref> and <xref rid=""pone.0311565.g004"" ref-type=""fig"">4C</xref>). The bi-allelically expressed genes included within the deleted region generally showed approximately half of the expression of the parental H9 line as expected, though the analysis of H9Δmat15q_2 neurons was again complicated by the lower concentration sample. While <italic toggle=""yes"">GABRG3</italic> was included in the deletion generated for all lines, its expression was not reliably measured within our system. Whether this is biological or technical is inconclusive. While <italic toggle=""yes"">UBE3A</italic> is bi-allelically expressed in ESCs, the paternal <italic toggle=""yes"">UBE3A</italic> copy undergoes silencing in neurons [<xref rid=""pone.0311565.ref021"" ref-type=""bibr"">21</xref>–<xref rid=""pone.0311565.ref023"" ref-type=""bibr"">23</xref>, <xref rid=""pone.0311565.ref026"" ref-type=""bibr"">26</xref>]. We showed that both maternal deletion demonstrated evidence of <italic toggle=""yes"">UBE3A</italic> imprinting (<xref rid=""pone.0311565.g004"" ref-type=""fig"">Fig 4C</xref> and <xref rid=""pone.0311565.s006"" ref-type=""supplementary-material"">S6 Fig</xref>). Successful neuron differentiation for all lines was shown through typical neuron morphology (<xref rid=""pone.0311565.g004"" ref-type=""fig"">Fig 4A</xref> and <xref rid=""pone.0311565.s006"" ref-type=""supplementary-material"">S6 Fig</xref>), increase in neuronal gene expression (<xref rid=""pone.0311565.s007"" ref-type=""supplementary-material"">S7 Fig</xref>), neuronal protein expression (<xref rid=""pone.0311565.s006"" ref-type=""supplementary-material"">S6 Fig</xref>), and decrease in expression of pluripotency genes (<xref rid=""pone.0311565.s007"" ref-type=""supplementary-material"">S7 Fig</xref>). <italic toggle=""yes"">SOX2</italic> and <italic toggle=""yes"">KLF4</italic>, two genes canonically referred to as pluripotency factors, did not decrease in expression. This could be due to their role in neural stem cell maintenance [<xref rid=""pone.0311565.ref052"" ref-type=""bibr"">52</xref>] and neurogenesis [<xref rid=""pone.0311565.ref053"" ref-type=""bibr"">53</xref>]. Further functional studies of these hESC-derived neurons could determine if they display similar deficits to those found in iPSC-derived neurons [<xref rid=""pone.0311565.ref054"" ref-type=""bibr"">54</xref>]. These isogenic cell lines provide a powerful resource to carefully discern cellular and molecular phenotypes between disease and wild type states for these large chromosomal deletions. We posit that the use of these isogenic pairs will lead to more robust and reproducible results, especially when combined with additional isogenic pairs and/or patient-derived iPSC lines. Additionally, these resources may open the door for the discovery of novel, more specific therapeutic approaches for AS and PWS patients. Lastly, this work adds to the current literature supporting the utility of CRISPR/Cas9 editing to eliminate large regions of the genome and its application to model disorders with large copy number variants.

Psychological conditions of caregivers of adult subjects with Prader-Willi syndrome,,"Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) is a rare genetic neurodevelopmental disorder caused by the lack of expression of paternally inherited imprinted genes on chromosome 15q11–q13 [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR1"">1</xref>, <xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR2"">2</xref>]. It is primarily characterized by hypotonia and poor feeding in early infancy, followed by excessive eating and the gradual development of morbid obesity from early childhood if uncontrolled). Multiple endocrine abnormalities, such as hypogonadism and short stature, intellectual disabilities, and other critical psychological features also characterize the PWS phenotype [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR3"">3</xref>]. Individuals with PWS face a range of cognitive, behavioral, and emotional challenges. Cognitive impairments, including mild to moderate intellectual disabilities, impact their learning abilities and everyday functioning. Behavioral issues, such as controlling and compulsive behaviors, negatively affected their interactions [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR4"">4</xref>]. Mood disorders like anxiety and depression are prevalent among this population, often exacerbated by social isolation and the constant need for routine and structure. Some adults may also experience psychotic symptoms, adding another layer of complexity to their psychological profile [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR5"">5</xref>]. Individuals with PWS require comprehensive and lifelong care, posing significant demands on their caregivers. Caregivers, often family members, face several challenges due to the complex and multifaceted nature of the syndrome. They are required to deal with many daily life issues, such as managing hyperphagia and obesity, addressing behavioral and psychiatric problems, and providing support for intellectual disabilities of individuals with PWS [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR6"">6</xref>]. The burden on caregivers is substantial, encompassing physical, emotional, and financial dimensions [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR7"">7</xref>]. Many studies have assessed the burden of caregiving by examining caregiver psychological distress and coping, reporting higher levels of stress and mood disturbances, and difficulties in coping strategies in caregivers dealing with their child’s problems [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR8"">8</xref>](The cumulative effect of these burdens significantly impacts the quality of life for caregivers, as well as their health and well-being. This, in turn, can affect the quality of care provided to the individual with PWS, creating a cycle of increasing stress and burden [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR9"">9</xref>]. In this regard, coping style is a particularly relevant factor associated with the management of PWS. Literature has traditionally conceptualized coping as how people respond and act when experiencing stress [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR10"">10</xref>]. Coping strategies are individuals’ cognitive and behavioral efforts to interpret and overcome problems and challenges [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR11"">11</xref>, <xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR12"">12</xref>]. Some coping strategies may be related to solving problems, changing the situation, and changing the source of stress (problem-focused coping strategies). In contrast, others are related to emotional responses to stress (emotional-focused coping strategies) [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR13"">13</xref>]. In particular, avoidance coping involves cognitive and behavioral efforts oriented toward denying, minimizing, or otherwise avoiding dealing directly with stressful demands [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR14"">14</xref>]. Coping plays a vital role in modulating the physical and psychological burden in caregiving [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR15"">15</xref>]. As mentioned by Shivers and colleagues [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR16"">16</xref>], caring for individuals with PWS requires the adoption of active coping strategies by the caregivers to deal with their needs. On the contrary, avoidant coping strategies may be particularly detrimental for caregivers of individuals with PWS, also influencing their quality of life and satisfaction. Although it is clear that caregivers play a critical role in the well-being of individuals with PWS, there is a relative lack of research focused on their experiences and needs. In addition, most of the research focused their attention on caregivers of children with PWS [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR6"">6</xref>, <xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR17"">17</xref>, <xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR18"">18</xref>], while less is known about the experience of taking care of adults with PWS [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR19"">19</xref>]. Nevertheless, understanding the potential negative impact of caregiving for individuals with PWS is essential because the burden and lack of well-being that caregivers experience can reach clinical levels for the caregivers and directly impact the quality of care and the outcome for the individuals with PWS [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR20"">20</xref>]. The current study aims to assess the psychological conditions of caregivers of adult individuals with PWS focusing on psychological distress and coping and comparing the levels of psychological well-being in caregivers and their relatives with PWS. In addition, we explored possible associations between coping strategies and well-being in caregivers, addressing the hypothesis that negative coping strategies could have a negative association with psychological well-being.   The present study was aimed at assessing the psychological conditions of caregivers of adult individuals with PWS, focusing on psychological distress and coping and making comparisons between the levels of psychological well-being in caregivers and their relatives with PWS. Our results highlighted several critical insights into the profound emotional and psychological challenges faced by caregivers of subjects with PWS. In particular, the results of the study revealed that caregivers experienced high levels of anxiety and depression in comparison with the corresponding Italian normative samples (of the general population). These findings seem to confirm and extend to the adult population what previous literature underlined about the negative impact of caregiving children with PWS on caregivers’ well-being and quality of life [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR26"">26</xref>, <xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR27"">27</xref>]. In particular, when compared to other families of children with a disability, caregivers of children with PWS reported higher levels of stress and mood disturbances, more difficulties coping with their child’s symptoms, higher levels of family conflict as well as lower quality of life [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR8"">8</xref>]. This finding may be attributable to the continuous challenges and difficulties of caring for a relative with a lifelong neurodevelopmental condition [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR28"">28</xref>] such as the acceptance of the child’s diagnosis and its implications, the need to provide constant supervision and support, but also the complexity of this particular syndrome in which hyperphagia is considered the most relevant factor associated with the caregiving burden [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR29"">29</xref>]. Meanwhile, the financial strain of managing PWS, with its associated medical and therapeutic costs [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR30"">30</xref>], may contribute to the psychological distress experienced by caregivers. Ragusa and colleagues [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR19"">19</xref>] investigated the impact of PWS on daily life and needs, and explored the resources of individuals with PWS and their caregivers, using the narrative medicine approach. The research involved twenty-one children and adolescents, thirty-four adult subjects with PWS, and one hundred and thirty-three caregivers. Most caregivers reported fatigue and required assistance to better manage the food-seeking behaviors of their children which have been considered the most challenging aspects of PWS to manage in the domestic context. Relationships external to the family were reported to be challenging to preserve, imposing a radical change in social life. A consistent number of caregivers declared that they had to change their jobs because of their children with PWS. Regarding future perspectives, PWS family caregivers reported a great concern about the future of their sons and daughters with PWS. Furthermore, our comparison between caregivers and individuals with PWS in PGWBI provided an interesting additional confirmation of the poor psychological conditions of caregivers in PWS, with caregivers showing lower scores in Positive Well-being, General Health, and Vitality subscale and Total of PGWBI than their relatives with PWS. Subjects with PWS reported higher vitality and well-being than their caregivers. This surprising result can be explained by their living context. Individuals with PWS usually live with their families in a controlled environment and follow periodical medical visits for their entire lives, and all their familial, medical, and social resources may contribute to making them feel protected and prevent them from living significant experiences on their own, especially the negative ones. According to our results, the caregivers’ psychological well-being did not change significantly based on the rec-GH therapy of subjects with PWS. Similarly, there were no differences between the levels of psychological well-being in patients who were treated with GH and those who were not, in contrast with the limited available literature [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR26"">26</xref>]. A possible explanation for this inconsistent result could be related to the different methodological designs adopted for the different studies. The current study used a cross-sectional design to describe the present status of the sample. In contrast, the above-mentioned study of Bertella and colleagues was a longitudinal design, aimed to assess the effects of GH therapy over time and so, more suited to detect changes that might occur over a period of time. The caregivers’ psychological well-being was associated with the use of an avoidant coping strategy, resulting in a significant negative correlation between PGWBI and the Avoidance subscale of COPE in caregivers of individuals with PWS. This result is consistent with previous work [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR31"">31</xref>] elucidating that avoidance strategy was associated with poor psychological outcomes, such as low psychological well-being and high depression in caregivers of children with chronic diseases. Our results also showed a positive and significant correlation between positive attitude and social support with problem orientation on the COPE. This result seems to confirm that people can use active coping strategies to deal with problems, such as problem-focused coping strategies based on personal characteristics including being more active than others to cope with problems by doing something active to alleviate stressful circumstances or regulate the emotional consequences of stressful events such as receiving social support or having positive attitudes to the problems [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR32"">32</xref>]. In conclusion, this study highlighted the psychological conditions of caregivers of adult subjects with PWS, contributing to our understanding of the broader impact of the syndrome on the quality of life of individuals and their families. This study is not free of limitations, including a relatively small number of participants due to the rare nature of the diseases and the lack of comparisons with other clinical populations. In addition, the study did not consider possible gender differences in coping strategies [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR33"">33</xref>]given the imbalanced representation of the two genders in our study population. Despite the above limitations, this is one of the few studies exploring the caregiver burden in adult individuals with PWS, in contrast to the vast majority of studies involving caregivers of children populations with PWS. In addition, the study holds substantial clinical relevance, highlighting the significant burden placed on caregivers. Healthcare providers and researchers should collaborate to develop and implement tailored interventions that address the specific challenges of caring for PWS individuals, prioritizing caregiver well-being as a fundamental component of PWS management. Integrating caregiver support into the healthcare system is crucial. Regular mental health screenings for caregivers should be conducted to identify those at risk of severe psychological distress. Providing resources and referrals to mental health professionals can facilitate timely intervention. Furthermore, multidisciplinary care teams should be ensured to support the caregivers and guarantee a comprehensive approach to the management of PWS. Future research examining larger sample sizes, groups of comparison, and the impact of additional variables such as gender is required. Understanding the interplay between caregiver well-being and patient outcomes in PWS can further be investigated to provide insights into tailored intervention strategies.",N/A,22 10 2024
Characterization of Circulating Protein Profiles in Individuals with Prader–Willi Syndrome and Individuals with Non-Syndromic Obesity,"<bold>Background:</bold> Prader–Willi syndrome (PWS) is a rare genetic disorder characterized by distinctive physical, cognitive, and behavioral manifestations, coupled with profound alterations in appetite regulation, leading to severe obesity and metabolic dysregulation. These clinical features arise from disruptions in neurodevelopment and neuroendocrine regulation, yet the molecular intricacies of PWS remain incompletely understood. <bold>Methods</bold>: This study aimed to comprehensively profile circulating neuromodulatory factors in the serum of 53 subjects with PWS and 34 patients with non-syndromic obesity, utilizing a proximity extension assay with the Olink Target 96 neuro-exploratory and neurology panels. The ANOVA <italic toggle=""yes"">p</italic>-values were adjusted for multiple testing using the Benjamani–Hochberg method. Protein–protein interaction networks were generated in STRING V.12. Corrplots were calculated with R4.2.2 by using the Hmisc, Performance Analytics, and Corrplot packages <bold>Results</bold>: Our investigation explored the potential genetic underpinnings of the circulating protein signature observed in PWS, revealing intricate connections between genes in the PWS critical region and the identified circulating proteins associated with impaired oxytocin, NAD metabolism, and sex-related neuromuscular impairment involving, CD38, KYNU, NPM1, NMNAT1, WFIKKN1, and GDF-8/MSTN. The downregulation of CD38 in individuals with PWS (<italic toggle=""yes"">p</italic> < 0.01) indicates dysregulation of oxytocin release, implicating pathways associated with NAD metabolism in which KYNU and NMNAT1 are involved and significantly downregulated in PWS (<italic toggle=""yes"">p</italic> < 0.01 and <italic toggle=""yes"">p</italic> < 0.05, respectively). Sex-related differences in the circulatory levels of WFIKKN1 and GDF-8/MSTN (<italic toggle=""yes"">p</italic> < 0.05) were also observed. <bold>Conclusions:</bold> This study highlights potential circulating protein biomarkers associated with impaired oxytocin, NAD metabolism, and sex-related neuromuscular impairment in PWS individuals with potential clinical implications.","Prader–Willi syndrome (PWS) is a rare genetic disorder, occurring in about 1 in 21,000 newborns [<xref rid=""B1-jcm-13-05697"" ref-type=""bibr"">1</xref>], known for its distinctive physical, cognitive, and behavioral manifestations. It results from a lack of expression of genes located on the paternal chromosome 15q11.2-q13, leading to disruptions in neurodevelopment and neuroendocrine regulation. The complex clinical phenotype observed in individuals with PWS is driven by various genetic mechanisms, including interstitial deletion of the paternal chromosome 15 (del15q11.2-q13) (DEL15), maternal uniparental disomy of chromosome 15 (UPD15), and imprinting defects [<xref rid=""B2-jcm-13-05697"" ref-type=""bibr"">2</xref>]. The most common genetic abnormality observed in PWS, occurring in about 60–70% of cases, is DEL15. UPD15 accounts for 25–35% of cases, while imprinting defects contribute to 1–4% of cases [<xref rid=""B3-jcm-13-05697"" ref-type=""bibr"">3</xref>]. Clinically, PWS is characterized by severe neonatal hypotonia, poor feeding, and a lack of appetite in infancy, followed by morbid obesity (if uncontrolled), making it the most common syndromic form of life-threatening obesity [<xref rid=""B4-jcm-13-05697"" ref-type=""bibr"">4</xref>]. The development of obesity arises from hyperphagic behavior and dysfunctional appetite control mechanisms [<xref rid=""B5-jcm-13-05697"" ref-type=""bibr"">5</xref>,<xref rid=""B6-jcm-13-05697"" ref-type=""bibr"">6</xref>,<xref rid=""B7-jcm-13-05697"" ref-type=""bibr"">7</xref>]. Endocrine abnormalities such as hypogonadism, growth hormone deficiency, central hypothyroidism, adrenal insufficiency, premature adrenarche, and osteoporosis are common in individuals with PWS [<xref rid=""B8-jcm-13-05697"" ref-type=""bibr"">8</xref>,<xref rid=""B9-jcm-13-05697"" ref-type=""bibr"">9</xref>,<xref rid=""B10-jcm-13-05697"" ref-type=""bibr"">10</xref>]. Moreover, developmental delays, intellectual disabilities, speech and articulation defects, as well as behavioral and psychiatric features, including tantrums, obsessive compulsive tendencies, and autistic-like traits, are prevalent and can be associated with specific genetic subtypes [<xref rid=""B8-jcm-13-05697"" ref-type=""bibr"">8</xref>]. The paternally expressed genes, particularly small nuclear ribonucleoprotein polypeptide N (<italic toggle=""yes"">SNRPN</italic>) [<xref rid=""B9-jcm-13-05697"" ref-type=""bibr"">9</xref>] and MAGE family member L2 (<italic toggle=""yes"">MAGEL2</italic>), are extensively studied for their roles in neurodevelopment and synaptic function [<xref rid=""B10-jcm-13-05697"" ref-type=""bibr"">10</xref>]. Other genes include Necdin-MAGE Family Member (<italic toggle=""yes"">NDN</italic>), Makorin ring finger protein 3 (<italic toggle=""yes"">MKRN3</italic>), and Nuclear pore-associated protein 1 <italic toggle=""yes"">(NPAP1</italic>) [<xref rid=""B11-jcm-13-05697"" ref-type=""bibr"">11</xref>,<xref rid=""B12-jcm-13-05697"" ref-type=""bibr"">12</xref>]. The same chromosomal region contains several ncRNA genes, such as multiple clusters of snoRNAs, such as <italic toggle=""yes"">SNORD116</italic>, and the long non-coding RNAs Prader–Willi/Angelman Region RNA 1 (<italic toggle=""yes"">PWAR1</italic> or <italic toggle=""yes"">PAR-1</italic>), Prader–Willi/Angelman Region RNA 2 (<italic toggle=""yes"">PWAR1</italic> or <italic toggle=""yes"">PAR-2</italic>), and Imprinted in Prader–Willi (<italic toggle=""yes"">IPW</italic>) [<xref rid=""B13-jcm-13-05697"" ref-type=""bibr"">13</xref>,<xref rid=""B14-jcm-13-05697"" ref-type=""bibr"">14</xref>,<xref rid=""B15-jcm-13-05697"" ref-type=""bibr"">15</xref>,<xref rid=""B16-jcm-13-05697"" ref-type=""bibr"">16</xref>,<xref rid=""B17-jcm-13-05697"" ref-type=""bibr"">17</xref>]. Dysregulation of these genes contributes to the typical phenotype in PWS [<xref rid=""B3-jcm-13-05697"" ref-type=""bibr"">3</xref>]. For example, the absence of the <italic toggle=""yes"">NDN</italic> gene has been suggested to contribute to the hypogonadotropic hypogonadal phenotype [<xref rid=""B18-jcm-13-05697"" ref-type=""bibr"">18</xref>], to regulate the proliferation of white adipocyte progenitor cells in mice [<xref rid=""B19-jcm-13-05697"" ref-type=""bibr"">19</xref>], and to determine both heart systolic and diastolic dysfunction in mice [<xref rid=""B20-jcm-13-05697"" ref-type=""bibr"">20</xref>]. Similarly, the loss of <italic toggle=""yes"">Magel2</italic> has been shown to reduce fertility [<xref rid=""B21-jcm-13-05697"" ref-type=""bibr"">21</xref>] and determine hypothalamic endocrine dysfunction in mice [<xref rid=""B22-jcm-13-05697"" ref-type=""bibr"">22</xref>]. Moreover, <italic toggle=""yes"">Snord116 +/−</italic> mice exhibit cognitive dysfunction [<xref rid=""B23-jcm-13-05697"" ref-type=""bibr"">23</xref>] and the deletion of <italic toggle=""yes"">Snord116</italic> in the mediobasal hypothalamus of adult mice leads to a hyperphagic phenotype, with some animals developing obesity [<xref rid=""B24-jcm-13-05697"" ref-type=""bibr"">24</xref>]. Molecular alterations in PWS extend beyond the function of individual genes within the PWS locus. For example, <italic toggle=""yes"">SNRPN</italic> encodes a component of the small nuclear ribonucleoprotein complex, responsible for pre-mRNA processing and contributing to tissue-specific alternative splicing of several target mRNAs [<xref rid=""B25-jcm-13-05697"" ref-type=""bibr"">25</xref>,<xref rid=""B26-jcm-13-05697"" ref-type=""bibr"">26</xref>,<xref rid=""B27-jcm-13-05697"" ref-type=""bibr"">27</xref>]. For example, the knockdown of <italic toggle=""yes"">Snrpn</italic>, in cultured primary mice cortical neurons, affected the expression of nuclear receptor subfamily 4 group A member 1 (<italic toggle=""yes"">Nr4a1</italic>) [<xref rid=""B28-jcm-13-05697"" ref-type=""bibr"">28</xref>], a gene with crucial functions in neural development and plasticity [<xref rid=""B29-jcm-13-05697"" ref-type=""bibr"">29</xref>]. Additionally, <italic toggle=""yes"">SNORD116</italic> deletion impaired neuronal differentiation, proliferation, and survival, possibly due to the impact on multiple mRNA targets [<xref rid=""B30-jcm-13-05697"" ref-type=""bibr"">30</xref>]. The emerging picture describes the genes of the PWS locus as part of a complex regulatory network that likely orchestrates a cascade of events leading to a broad spectrum of endocrinological, neurological, and psychological complications in PWS. These genetic perturbations may influence the circulating proteome in PWS, potentially revealing circulating proteins regulated by genes in the critical region of the disease. Investigating these alterations in the circulatory proteome could provide new insights into the clinical aspects of PWS and identify easily accessible biomarkers to monitor disease complications and treatment efficacy.   Our exploratory study aimed to characterize circulating protein profiles in individuals with Prader–Willi Syndrome (PWS) and non-syndromic obesity. Due to the complexity of the disease and its poor molecular characterization, circulating proteome profiling assumes a particular relevance. It possibly aids in the identification of biomarkers specific to PWS, which can support diagnosis, monitor disease progression, and help tailor treatment strategies, potentially improving the management of PWS by addressing obesity and the neurological and psychological aspects of the syndrome. We identified significant alterations in protein expression patterns between the two groups by utilizing a targeted proteomic approach based on the PEA technology. Those panels focus on markers associated with signal transduction, regulation of the nervous system, hormone release, and regulation of metabolism. Notably, three proteins, DDR1, WFIKKN1, and GDF-8, also known as myostatin, exhibited significantly lower levels in female subjects with PWS than males, suggesting an association with neuromuscular impairment in female PWS subjects. Indeed, WFIKKN1 binds and inhibits GDF-8 [<xref rid=""B49-jcm-13-05697"" ref-type=""bibr"">49</xref>,<xref rid=""B50-jcm-13-05697"" ref-type=""bibr"">50</xref>,<xref rid=""B51-jcm-13-05697"" ref-type=""bibr"">51</xref>], thus regulating muscle growth [<xref rid=""B52-jcm-13-05697"" ref-type=""bibr"">52</xref>]. In previous studies, the serum levels of WFIKKNI were negatively correlated with aging [<xref rid=""B53-jcm-13-05697"" ref-type=""bibr"">53</xref>]. However, this correlation was not observed in our PWS subjects. GDF-8 serves as a negative regulator of muscle growth, and some studies suggested its potential role as a biomarker in neuromuscular disorders characterized by muscle atrophy and wasting. For instance, studies have linked reduced serum myostatin levels to the progression of genetic muscle disease [<xref rid=""B54-jcm-13-05697"" ref-type=""bibr"">54</xref>], possibly attributed to the downregulation of the myostatin pathway as a compensatory mechanism in response to muscle wasting or atrophy [<xref rid=""B55-jcm-13-05697"" ref-type=""bibr"">55</xref>]. Hypotonia, or decreased muscle tone, is a common characteristic of individuals with Prader–Willi syndrome regardless of gender [<xref rid=""B5-jcm-13-05697"" ref-type=""bibr"">5</xref>]. Even if the severity of hypotonia can vary among individuals with PWS, to our knowledge, no studies have been conducted with the specific aim of identifying sex-related differences in this regard. However, it should be considered that GDF-8 may be influenced by multiple factors including diseases such as nutritional and metabolic status, inflammation [<xref rid=""B56-jcm-13-05697"" ref-type=""bibr"">56</xref>], heart failure [<xref rid=""B56-jcm-13-05697"" ref-type=""bibr"">56</xref>,<xref rid=""B57-jcm-13-05697"" ref-type=""bibr"">57</xref>], and female fertility-related diseases [<xref rid=""B58-jcm-13-05697"" ref-type=""bibr"">58</xref>]. Carvalho and colleagues, by studying a group of young adult obese patients, associated high GDF-8 and LP/ADP levels with metabolic syndrome, glucose-insulin homeostasis impairment, and low muscle mass [<xref rid=""B59-jcm-13-05697"" ref-type=""bibr"">59</xref>]. Additionally, they found significantly higher GDF-8 serum levels in metabolically unhealthy females [<xref rid=""B59-jcm-13-05697"" ref-type=""bibr"">59</xref>]. Considering the exploratory nature of the present study, it is crucial to extend the research on validating GDF-8 as a circulatory marker of hypotonia, especially in neonatal PWS subjects. Our analysis of circulating proteome revealed significant differences in the expression levels of 29 proteins between individuals with PWS and subjects with non-syndromic obesity, with the majority of proteins displaying downregulation in the PWS group. However, several exceptions were noted, including BCAN, SMPD1, NCAN, DSG3, and EPHB6, which exhibited upregulation in PWS serum. Brevican and neurocan are extracellular matrix proteins primarily found in the central nervous system, contributing to neural development and synaptic plasticity [<xref rid=""B60-jcm-13-05697"" ref-type=""bibr"">60</xref>,<xref rid=""B61-jcm-13-05697"" ref-type=""bibr"">61</xref>]. Given their involvement in these critical processes, alterations in their expression levels may signify underlying neurological dysfunctions in PWS. Interestingly, previous studies have linked brevican and neurocan to various neurological diseases, including dementia, Alzheimer’s disease, epilepsy, and small vessel diseases [<xref rid=""B62-jcm-13-05697"" ref-type=""bibr"">62</xref>,<xref rid=""B63-jcm-13-05697"" ref-type=""bibr"">63</xref>,<xref rid=""B64-jcm-13-05697"" ref-type=""bibr"">64</xref>]. The observed upregulation of brevican and neurocan in the serum of individuals with PWS raises intriguing questions regarding their potential roles in the pathophysiology of the syndrome. Further investigation is warranted to elucidate the specific mechanisms underlying their dysregulation and their implications for neurological function in PWS. Understanding the precise nature of the alterations associated with brevican and neurocan in PWS subjects could provide valuable insights into the neurological manifestations of the syndrome and potentially identify novel therapeutic targets. In this context, the decreased levels of RGMA, a glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchored protein that functions as a guidance molecule in the nervous system and which plays a crucial role in neural development, axonal growth, and cell migration [<xref rid=""B65-jcm-13-05697"" ref-type=""bibr"">65</xref>], further underline the neurodevelopmental regulation impairment in PWS. Interestingly, a clinical case with moderate intellectual disability, epilepsy, and truncal obesity, suspected of PWS, showed a 15q26.1 microdeletion encompassing two genes: Chromodomain helicase DNA-binding protein 2 (CHD2) and RGMA [<xref rid=""B66-jcm-13-05697"" ref-type=""bibr"">66</xref>]. Of particular interest is the serum reduction in CD38 observed in individuals with PWS. CD38, a type II transmembrane protein, plays a crucial role in regulating oxytocin release. Studies involving mice deficient in <italic toggle=""yes"">Cd38</italic> have shown decreased oxytocin levels in both plasma and cerebrospinal fluid, accompanied by elevated neuronal intracellular levels and abnormal social behavior [<xref rid=""B67-jcm-13-05697"" ref-type=""bibr"">67</xref>]. The mechanism of CD38 in oxytocin release relies on cyclic ADP-ribose (cADPR) and nicotinic acid adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NAADP) [<xref rid=""B68-jcm-13-05697"" ref-type=""bibr"">68</xref>]. This elucidates the enrichment observed in pathways related to ‘NAD metabolism’, ‘Tryptophan catabolism leading to NAD production’, and ‘NAD biosynthesis II’, influenced by other circulating proteins reduced in PWS, such as KYNU, an enzyme involved in Tryptophan metabolism [<xref rid=""B69-jcm-13-05697"" ref-type=""bibr"">69</xref>,<xref rid=""B70-jcm-13-05697"" ref-type=""bibr"">70</xref>] and NMNAT1, and denylyl transferase [<xref rid=""B71-jcm-13-05697"" ref-type=""bibr"">71</xref>], both contributing to NAD metabolism. The protein–protein interaction network suggests the influence of genes within the PWS-critical region on a subset of genes or proteins associated with NAD-dependent oxytocin release. In particular, MAGEL2 inactivation has already been associated with alterations in the oxytocin system in mice [<xref rid=""B72-jcm-13-05697"" ref-type=""bibr"">72</xref>,<xref rid=""B73-jcm-13-05697"" ref-type=""bibr"">73</xref>]. Evidence suggests dysregulation of the oxytocin system in individuals with PWS, and these neuropeptide pathways may offer promising targets for therapeutic interventions, though the mechanisms underlying this dysregulation in PWS require further investigation [<xref rid=""B74-jcm-13-05697"" ref-type=""bibr"">74</xref>]. Oxytocin-based therapies have been proposed, with studies indicating that low-dose intranasal oxytocin is safe for individuals with PWS and may lead to reductions in appetite drive, as well as improvements in socialization, anxiety, and repetitive behaviors [<xref rid=""B75-jcm-13-05697"" ref-type=""bibr"">75</xref>]. Thus, there arises the possibility of using serum CD38 and oxytocin levels as guides for treatment strategies. The downregulation of genes involved in key metabolic pathways, such as KYNU, NMNAT1, and RBKS, underscores their significance in metabolic regulation. KYNU and NMNAT1 play roles in essential metabolic processes [<xref rid=""B76-jcm-13-05697"" ref-type=""bibr"">76</xref>,<xref rid=""B77-jcm-13-05697"" ref-type=""bibr"">77</xref>], while RBKS contributes to ribose metabolism [<xref rid=""B78-jcm-13-05697"" ref-type=""bibr"">78</xref>]. In addition, the downregulation of MSR1 may impact both lipid uptake imbalance and/or neuroinflammatory pathways [<xref rid=""B79-jcm-13-05697"" ref-type=""bibr"">79</xref>], potentially contributing to fat accumulation alterations on one side, and cognitive and behavioral challenges on the other, as observed in PWS [<xref rid=""B80-jcm-13-05697"" ref-type=""bibr"">80</xref>,<xref rid=""B81-jcm-13-05697"" ref-type=""bibr"">81</xref>]. These downregulations explain their positive correlation with clinical parameters associated with PWS, including LDL cholesterol, triglycerides, glucose levels, glycated hemoglobin, and HOMA index. These findings shed light on the complex interplay between genetic factors and the circulating protein signature identified in PWS, emphasizing the need for further investigation into the molecular mechanisms underlying this syndrome. Our findings align with previous studies, providing additional support for the potential impact of PWS-imprinted genes on circulating protein expression. Despite the variations in models and techniques used across existing studies, this consistency underscores the robustness of our observations. Nevertheless, further studies employing multi-omics approaches and functional validation experiments are warranted to validate the identified genetic connections and elucidate their precise roles in disease pathogenesis. Despite the promising findings, this study has some limitations. One of the constraints is the relatively small sample size, both in terms of PWS cases and non-syndromic obesity controls. Moreover, the study’s exploratory nature should be considered when interpreting the findings. The aim was to generate hypotheses and provide a preliminary characterization of circulating protein profiles in PWS. As such, the results should be seen as a foundation for future research rather than definitive conclusions. Additional studies with larger cohorts are needed to validate the identified biomarkers and their potential role in clinics. In addition, we did not evaluate the influence of different comorbidities and medications on protein expression in the individuals. However, these factors were not the primary focus of the present project. Further studies are required to better understand these relevant aspects, which have been poorly investigated to date. In conclusion, our exploratory study aimed to characterize circulating protein profiles in individuals with PWS and non-syndromic obesity. Given the complexity of PWS and the limited molecular characterization, circulating proteome profiling shows significant potential as a source of biomarkers for clinical purposes. In this context, the observed alterations in DDR1, WFIKKN1, and GDF-8 offer promise as gender-related biomarkers for neuromuscular impairment in female PWS subjects. Additionally, the changes in CD38 levels may indicate dysregulation of the oxytocin system in PWS, suggesting that monitoring its circulatory levels could guide oxytocin-based therapies. Future directions include longitudinal studies to track dynamic changes in circulating protein profiles and validation studies to establish the clinical utility of these biomarkers.",N/A,25 9 2024
The influence of genotype makeup on the effectiveness of growth hormone therapy in children with Prader-Willi syndrome,,"Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) is a multifaceted genetic disorder affecting various systems [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR1"">1</xref>, <xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR2"">2</xref>]. The condition arises from the absence of gene expression from the maternally imprinted genes located on chromosome 15q11.2-q13.1. According to an Australia screening study, the birth incidence rate is approximately 1 in 8,290 [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR3"">3</xref>], aligning with the estimated range of 1 in 10,000 to 1 in 30,000 [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR4"">4</xref>, <xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR5"">5</xref>]. PWS is characterized by paternal deletions of chromosome 15q11.2-q13 (65–75%), maternal uniparental diploidy (20–30%), imprinting center defects (1–3%), and other infrequent conditions such as balanced translocation on 15q (< 1%). The symptoms of PWS include neonatal low muscle tone [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR6"">6</xref>], difficulties with sucking and feeding in the early stages of infancy [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR7"">7</xref>], increased food consumption in late infancy or toddlerhood, and the gradual development of severe obesity [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR7"">7</xref>]. Delays are observed in the progression of motor skills and language abilities [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR8"">8</xref>], along with varying levels of cognitive impairment [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR9"">9</xref>]. Certain growth abnormalities may arise as a consequence of diminished secretion of growth hormone (GH) [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR10"">10</xref>–<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR13"">13</xref>], hypogonadotropic hypogonadism leading to underdeveloped genitals and delayed puberty [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR14"">14</xref>–<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR16"">16</xref>], and central hypothyroidism [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR17"">17</xref>, <xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR18"">18</xref>]. Despite the general tendency for patients with PWS to develop significant insulin resistance (IR) and type 2 diabetes mellitus as they age and gain weight [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR19"">19</xref>], several studies have indicated that these patients may actually have higher insulin sensitivity compared to those with simple obesity [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR20"">20</xref>, <xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR21"">21</xref>]. This phenomenon highlights the unique metabolic characteristics of PWS. Typical characteristics of PWS include distinct facial characteristics [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR1"">1</xref>, <xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR22"">22</xref>], eye abnormalities [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR23"">23</xref>], spinal curvature, and hip malformation [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR24"">24</xref>]. Clinical presentation can vary based on the underlying genotypes; for example, patients with deletions tend to have higher body weight compared to those with mUPD. This is due to the fact that patients with the deletion tend to exhibit more severe overeating, resulting in increased intake. Patients with mUPD, on the other hand, tend to have lower levels of heavy binge eating, resulting in better controlled weight gain and a lower body mass index (BMI) [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR25"">25</xref>]. These genotype-specific differences underline the importance of tailored therapeutic approaches in managing PWS. Currently, regardless of GH deficiency, PWS patients seem to benefit from rhGH therapy in different ways [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR26"">26</xref>]. The use of rhGH effectively addresses the issue of limited height in children with PWS and significantly enhances metabolic well-being, physical composition, muscle strength, and psychomotor development [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR27"">27</xref>–<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR30"">30</xref>]. Moreover, studies based on observation and experience have demonstrated the beneficial effects of rhGH on the cognitive abilities of infants and toddlers with PWS [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR31"">31</xref>–<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR35"">35</xref>]. The decision to administer rhGH treatment and the development of dosing plans for PWS patients should not depend on the genotype of PWS [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR36"">36</xref>]. Although there has been some research on the topic, comprehensive studies examining the relationship between genotype and the outcomes of rhGH therapy in large, diverse populations of PWS patients remain limited. The main objective of our study was to investigate how genotype affects the outcome of rhGH therapy in children diagnosed with PWS.   While the exact age to initiate rhGH treatment remains uncertain, an increasing number of studies [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR27"">27</xref>, <xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR36"">36</xref>, <xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR42"">42</xref>] have confirmed significant advantages of early rhGH therapy for children diagnosed with PWS. The average and median age of receiving rhGH treatment in this group was during early childhood. Nevertheless, there is an inadequate amount of research examining the influence of the PWS genotype on individual growth metrics, blood examinations, and changes in x-ray imaging resulting from rhGH treatment. No variations in height/length, weight, or BMI SDS were observed among children with different PWS genotypes during rhGH treatment. These findings partially align with previous research [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR25"">25</xref>]. Their study differs from ours in that the average age of individuals starting GH treatment was 4 ± 0.4 years (ranging from birth to 49 years). This age was comparatively higher and failed to consider the potential influence of confounding variables, such as parental height and weight. During the follow-up period, the analysis revealed that the levels of FGLU in both groups of PWS were predominantly sustained within the standard range, and no significant disparity was observed between the two groups. This is comparable to prior research [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR28"">28</xref>, <xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR43"">43</xref>, <xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR44"">44</xref>]. Hyperinsulinemia was present initially but resolved by the end of the follow-up period. Both cohorts exhibited a rise in HOMA-IR levels surpassing the established norms towards the end of the observation period [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR45"">45</xref>]. Nevertheless, the alterations in FINS and HOMA-IR indicated that the deletion group was more prone to IR compared to the mUPD group. During GH therapy, both groups experienced IGF-1 SDS at levels exceeding 2 SD. Studies have examined and documented the safety of elevated IGF-1 levels, indicating the existence of increased IGF-1 bioactivity in children with PWS who have undergone rhGH treatment [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR46"">46</xref>]. Despite the PWS group having higher levels of IGF-1 SDS than normal, there was no alteration in the molar ratio of IGF-1 to IGF binding proteins-3 (IGFBP-3) [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR47"">47</xref>]. This indicates a consistent biological effect, and the monitoring process included improvements in IGF-BP3. In this specific group, it was noticed that the IGF-1 SDS showed a greater value in the deletion group in comparison to the mUPD group. This difference was statistically significant during the second year of treatment. Nevertheless, there were no notable differences noted regarding the age of rhGH treatment, dosage, and height SDS between the two groups. Further investigation is warranted as this observation suggests that the mUPD group exhibited greater sensitivity to GH or higher IGF-1 bioactivity compared to the deletion group. Moreover, it is important to mention that the occurrence of hypothyroidism among the group showed an increase from 10.38 to 11.64% to 21.92–22.64% throughout the observation period. Prior research has consistently indicated a significant prevalence of hypothyroidism in children who have been diagnosed with PWS, with a rate of occurrence of 25% and an average age of diagnosis of around two years [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR17"">17</xref>, <xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR18"">18</xref>, <xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR48"">48</xref>, <xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR49"">49</xref>]. Since the average and median age of the individuals in this specific group were in the early stages of life, it is uncertain if the observed rise in hypothyroidism occurrence can be linked to GH therapy. The occurrence of hip dysplasia was also significantly higher in the mUPD group than in the deletion group both before and after the rhGH treatment, contrary to the results of prior research [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR24"">24</xref>]. In addition, of the 32 patients who developed hypothyroidism after treatment, 30 were primary hypothyroidism (22 with deletion type and 8 with mUPD type) and 2 were secondary hypothyroidism (both deletion type). This significant rise in primary hypothyroidism raises questions about its potential autoimmune background. Typically, secondary hypothyroidism is more common in PWS patients due to hypothalamic dysfunction [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR50"">50</xref>]. However, the observed increase in primary hypothyroidism, especially of the autoimmune type, warrants further investigation to understand its etiology and possible link to rhGH therapy. This study has several limitations. Firstly, its retrospective nature may introduce bias and affect the generalizability of the results. Secondly, the number of laboratory samples was limited, which could impact on the robustness of the findings related to biochemical and metabolic markers. Third, data collected throughout all follow-up time points for the most extensive group of participants was incomplete. However, the research is still ongoing, and there are anticipated upcoming data additions that will be more extensive, covering longer periods of follow-up. To summarize, current research established that administering rhGH can effectively increase the height/length SDS in children with PWS. Significantly, there were no notable differences in growth metrics between the two groups when they underwent rhGH therapy. Nevertheless, the deletion group displayed a more pronounced tendency towards IR compared to the mUPD group. This observation suggests the possibility that the mUPD group may possess superior sensitivity to GH or exhibit higher IGF-1 bioactivity than the deletion group. To better understand the relationship between PWS genotype and hip dysplasia, future studies with larger sample sizes and longer follow-up periods are necessary.",N/A,1 10 2024
Management of food socialization for children with Prader-Willi Syndrome: An exploration study in Malaysia,"This study aims to explore the food management strategies among caregivers/family members of children with Prader–Willi Syndrome (PWS) using the lens of ‘familialisation’ of a health problem and the sociology of food socialization. Food intake among individuals with PWS is a main concern for parents, caregivers, and medical practitioners as it affects their physical, mental, and social well-being throughout their lives. Earlier studies on PWS and food intake centered around dietary management, dietary intake and growth, nutritional treatment and pharmacological approaches, nutritional phases, and weight gain. However, little has been done to understand the challenges of managing children with PWS from the sociological lens of food management strategies and socialization among families in Malaysia. This study is based on an investigation involving eight children with PWS and 46 family members and caregivers through lab observations and reflexive interviews. Ten food management strategies were identified that were adopted by the caregivers and families, which were influenced by cultural factors, family norms, and formal and informal support systems. The findings will influence future behavioral interventions to ensure the empowerment and well-being of individuals with PWS and their families.","As a complex neurodevelopmental disorder, Prader–Willi syndrome (PWS) represents a developmental challenge for children, especially regarding food. Recent examination of the natural history of PWS suggests a more complex progression leading to four main nutritional phases, with subphases for the first two phases [<xref rid=""pone.0307874.ref001"" ref-type=""bibr"">1</xref>]. Not all individuals with PWS experience all the phases and subphases, and their progression may be further altered using growth hormones [<xref rid=""pone.0307874.ref002"" ref-type=""bibr"">2</xref>]. Medical experts agree that behavioral interventions are possible, although they are yet to be well defined. In the early developmental phase, interventions to ensure proper nutrition include the utilization of special teats [<xref rid=""pone.0307874.ref003"" ref-type=""bibr"">3</xref>]. However, drastic measures, such as tube feeding [<xref rid=""pone.0307874.ref004"" ref-type=""bibr"">4</xref>, <xref rid=""pone.0307874.ref005"" ref-type=""bibr"">5</xref>] and swallowing training, are common among infants with PWS [<xref rid=""pone.0307874.ref004"" ref-type=""bibr"">4</xref>–<xref rid=""pone.0307874.ref006"" ref-type=""bibr"">6</xref>]. Other caregiver-suggested interventions include restrictive feeding and strict meal habits [<xref rid=""pone.0307874.ref007"" ref-type=""bibr"">7</xref>], monitoring of low-calorie and well-balanced diets, portion control, personalized nutrition [<xref rid=""pone.0307874.ref008"" ref-type=""bibr"">8</xref>] and ensuring regular physical exercises for children with PWS. Miller and Tan [<xref rid=""pone.0307874.ref009"" ref-type=""bibr"">9</xref>], suggested that mealtimes should be less stressful for the family. To decrease behaviors centered around food for the individual with PWS, recommendations were made for the whole family to eat the same, well-balanced, healthy diet and drink plain water or milk with meals. They found that these recommendations resulted in improved weight control for the individual with PWS and more peaceful meals for the family, without arguments regarding differences in diet between family members. Another common method of intervention is appropriate psychological and behavioral counseling of individuals with PWS and their caregivers [<xref rid=""pone.0307874.ref010"" ref-type=""bibr"">10</xref>] to manage symptoms and behavioral problems faced by PWS adolescent, including food theft, overeating, and tantrums. Interventions such as the reward system has been found by some to improve social skills and provide relevant tools for anger management. Another approach was family therapy, through which the counselor worked with the parents to establish a consistent parenting style and to standardize the family menu and structured daily routines [<xref rid=""pone.0307874.ref011"" ref-type=""bibr"">11</xref>]. Food habit concern among individuals with PWS is exacerbated in certain countries, such as Malaysia. First, as demonstrated by the Malaysian Food Barometer, food habits are characterized by a high rate of eating food prepared outside the home [<xref rid=""pone.0307874.ref012"" ref-type=""bibr"">12</xref>–<xref rid=""pone.0307874.ref016"" ref-type=""bibr"">16</xref>]. Second, the household structures commonly encompass several generations under the same roof and around the family dinner table. It is also common in Malaysia to have extended family members living as immediate neighbors which the children visit frequently. The available literature emphasizes on culture of individual autonomy and choice, even in food habits, while Asian societies tend to value intergenerational exchange and family responsibility [<xref rid=""pone.0307874.ref017"" ref-type=""bibr"">17</xref>]. Therefore, there are important social expectations and practices regarding the involvement of grandparents in raising grandchildren [<xref rid=""pone.0307874.ref018"" ref-type=""bibr"">18</xref>], although the norms and expectations may vary across the culturally diverse population of Malaysia. Finally, live-in domestic helpers are present in many households in Malaysia. There were 130,450 registered domestic helpers in Malaysia in 2018 [<xref rid=""pone.0307874.ref019"" ref-type=""bibr"">19</xref>]. Although the number was reported to have decreased during COVID-19 pandemic, those still serve as domestic helpers may play an important role in managing food habits among children with PWS. This research adopts a point of view that articulates two complementary perspectives to study the modality of “problematic” food behavior among children with PWS and its consequences on their family lives. These two perspectives are the “familialisation” of a health problem and the sociology of food socialization. The concept of familialisation is used to analyze the way a family understands and reinterprets the messages provided by medical experts during and after the diagnosis. These messages concern the disease, its cause, the modalities of its evolution, and how to care for a person with such a disease. The focus extends to the family roles to manage the presence of a person with health problems in everyday life. The concept of familialisation appeared first in the frame of medicalization studies. The notion of ""de-familialisation"" was used to analyze the transfer of activities and responsibilities from the frame of the family to state or private care systems [<xref rid=""pone.0307874.ref020"" ref-type=""bibr"">20</xref>]. This conceptual frame allowed to develop international comparisons [<xref rid=""pone.0307874.ref021"" ref-type=""bibr"">21</xref>–<xref rid=""pone.0307874.ref023"" ref-type=""bibr"">23</xref>] and to study the implications on gender equality [<xref rid=""pone.0307874.ref024"" ref-type=""bibr"">24</xref>]. An alternative formulation of the concept of familialisation have been used by some French scholars such as Keppens (2010), Martin et al. (2016), and Rochedy et al. (2023) to describe the way family members understand, reinterpret and finally use the advice of medical experts to re-organize family life, including the redistribution of parental roles [<xref rid=""pone.0307874.ref025"" ref-type=""bibr"">25</xref>–<xref rid=""pone.0307874.ref027"" ref-type=""bibr"">27</xref>]. This concept has been further articulated in the Food Social Norms Internalization (FSNI) theory based on a study of families with PWS child [<xref rid=""pone.0307874.ref027"" ref-type=""bibr"">27</xref>]. This process relates to how the family of an individual with PWS appropriates messages and advice formulated by health experts at the time of diagnosis. Exploring these concerns would provide important insights towards intervention initiative and case management [<xref rid=""pone.0307874.ref028"" ref-type=""bibr"">28</xref>]. Familialisation concerns several questions: How do parents understand the explanation given by the medical experts on the syndrome-specific trajectory that goes from anorexic behavior at the beginning of the life to hyperphagia that lasts from childhood to adulthood and is characterized by strong cravings for food and relentless thinking about it? How in such a context does the family manage the supervision of food practices? Which educative strategies do they consider? To what extent are the employed strategies informed by knowledge and advice from the healthcare team? Who are the actors involved in the caregiving processes, and who tends to take the responsibility? How many significant others are involved in the supervision of food practices, and what social position do they hold in the family (i.e., mother, grandmother, domestic helper, uncle, grandfather)?. These research questions connect with the sociology of food regarding the internalization of rules and social norms [<xref rid=""pone.0307874.ref029"" ref-type=""bibr"">29</xref>, <xref rid=""pone.0307874.ref030"" ref-type=""bibr"">30</xref>]. The internalization of food behaviors not only allows a child to eat in society as they learn about table manners, such as the use of tools, body control, postures, chewing habits, body noises but also food gratification, and identification of common and individual spaces at the table. Some authors have suggested that during childhood, individuals typically go through a so-called ""neophobia"" phase [<xref rid=""pone.0307874.ref031"" ref-type=""bibr"">31</xref>–<xref rid=""pone.0307874.ref033"" ref-type=""bibr"">33</xref>]. Throughout the neophobic cycle, the social interactions between parents, caregivers and the child will contribute to the internalization of the food norms [<xref rid=""pone.0307874.ref034"" ref-type=""bibr"">34</xref>]. The process of food socialization among children with PWS is further exacerbated as their condition is often tied to concerns surrounding food control [<xref rid=""pone.0307874.ref035"" ref-type=""bibr"">35</xref>]. While most of the medical literature dedicated to autism clearly identifies the issues related to food habits, they have been mainly problematized in terms of nutritional risks. A few works have proposed a problematization from the social sciences for autism at large [<xref rid=""pone.0307874.ref036"" ref-type=""bibr"">36</xref>, <xref rid=""pone.0307874.ref037"" ref-type=""bibr"">37</xref>] or more specifically the subjects with PWS [<xref rid=""pone.0307874.ref027"" ref-type=""bibr"">27</xref>, <xref rid=""pone.0307874.ref038"" ref-type=""bibr"">38</xref>]. PWS in Malaysia has evolved from being supported under the umbrella of rare diseases to a disease that has specific support groups and interventions. Medical and healthcare providers since 80s recognized that PWS management was not about managing the child’s medical needs but requiring the whole family to understand and support initiatives. Early support came from family activities and family camps, organized by government hospitals and clinic staff. These camps reduced stigma related to PWS, built relationships between families, and provided social and mental support. Interventions expanded beyond medical advice and focused on familial interactions, home nursing procedures, and social adjustments. In 2004, families collaborated to establish the Malaysian Rare Disorders Society, a non-profit organization dedicated to providing support, education, and empowerment to families. In 2016, the Persatuan Sindrom Prader-Willi Malaysia (PWSAM) was formed to foster awareness, support individuals and families, and provide accurate information to the public. Scholarly investigations into PWS in Malaysia are lacking [<xref rid=""pone.0307874.ref039"" ref-type=""bibr"">39</xref>], with researchers focusing on the medical aspects of an ailment, namely on prevalence and treatment strategies [<xref rid=""pone.0307874.ref040"" ref-type=""bibr"">40</xref>–<xref rid=""pone.0307874.ref042"" ref-type=""bibr"">42</xref>] to general chromosomal abnormalities and on disabilities in general. Studies investigating the symptom management of PWS in children in Malaysia, especially their insatiability for food and family interactions, are yet to be conducted [<xref rid=""pone.0307874.ref043"" ref-type=""bibr"">43</xref>]. Malaysian caregivers struggle to care for their children with limiting conditions due to unavailable or inaccessible information [<xref rid=""pone.0307874.ref044"" ref-type=""bibr"">44</xref>] as well as facilities and care services [<xref rid=""pone.0307874.ref045"" ref-type=""bibr"">45</xref>]. Therefore, this study aims to investigate the process of (de)familializing food management in families with PWS children and understand the food socialization of PWS children in the Malaysian context. The data obtained from this research is part of a larger research cooperative set-up for the Hubert Curien Partnership France-Malaysia (Hibiscus) research titled “The Socialization of eating practices in children with Prader-Willi syndrome” (MYPAIR/1/2020/SS05/TAYLOR/1), which aims to compare findings from France and Malaysia. The cooperative takes place in the research activities of the Centre Prader Willi France at Toulouse University Hospital, directed by Professor Maïthé Tauber in partnership with CERTOP-CNRS 5044 of the University of Toulouse and ISTHIA. This Hibiscus project is a partnership between Toulouse University in France and Taylor’s University in Malaysia within the framework of the Chair “Food Cultures & Health.” In France, it takes place at the OVALIE experimental platform of Toulouse University and in Malaysia at the Social Behavioural Lab situated at Taylor’s University. The methodology are three complementary techniques: 1) expert interviews, including of members of a medical team as well as founders of national associations, 2) observations of family meals and 3) reflexive interviews with individuals with PWS and their family members. The observation is followed by a reflexive interview during which extracts of the recorded meal sessions were shown and used to support the discussion. The interviews provided macro-level context for the available support in Malaysia, while the observations gave micro-level insights into the interactions among family members and the strategies, they use to manage the eating behaviors of children with PWS. For the Malaysian research project, the research procedure was approved by the Ethics committee of Taylor’s University (Reference No: HEC 2020/149) and the University of Malaya Medical Centre (UMMC) (MREC ID No: 2021112–9711). The recruitment was done between January–March 2022 with the support of PWSAM and UMMC. All participants and their legal representatives provided written informed consent before participating in the study on the research procedures and rights as well as for their information to be published. With a focus on the strategies used by families to manage the eating behavior of their children with PWS and uncovering the transformations and development of their children over time, this article draws from the findings of the above methods. Following the research briefing, the session for lab observation with the families was arranged at the Social Behavioural Lab at Taylor’s University. Lab observation is an important feature of this study to enrich the understanding of social interaction on eating habits [<xref rid=""pone.0307874.ref046"" ref-type=""bibr"">46</xref>–<xref rid=""pone.0307874.ref048"" ref-type=""bibr"">48</xref>]. The families were allowed to invite any family members who frequently ate together with the individual with PWS. As a result, the number of participants ranged from four to ten persons per session, with a total of 53 participants (refer to <xref rid=""pone.0307874.t001"" ref-type=""table"">Table 1</xref> below). The room was set up with a long 10-seat table in the middle of the room with chairs, including highchairs, and the family decided on their seating arrangements. The food was placed on a side table, and the family was instructed to serve themselves as they usually would at home as part of the observation. The reflexive interviews were conducted at the Social Behavioural Laboratory at Taylor’s University as a continuation of the meal observations. The reflexive interviews followed three main phases. During the first part of the interview, families were asked to reflect on excerpts from the video recordings of the meal, which were recorded and edited during the session at the Social Behavioural Lab. Among the selected excerpts were social interaction difficulties, table rules, and taste-related emotions, with the objective of encouraging the families to discuss their practices. The first part of the interview aimed at strengthening credibility, where the researchers assessed participants to ensure that their interpretations were credible and in line with the participants’ comprehension of their lived experiences. The second part of the interview focused on the neophobia of the child with PWS and its transformation over the years. This phase was supported by sharing previous findings from the French research team [<xref rid=""pone.0307874.ref033"" ref-type=""bibr"">33</xref>, <xref rid=""pone.0307874.ref035"" ref-type=""bibr"">35</xref>–<xref rid=""pone.0307874.ref037"" ref-type=""bibr"">37</xref>], which aimed to guide the participants to extract themselves from the current meal observation and adopt the position of ""experts."" The third and final stage focused on the strategies developed by the family to manage the eating behavior of their child with PWS and the transformation of these strategies throughout the development of the child. The interviews ranged between 30 and 60 minutes in duration and were audio and video recorded. The content of the interviews was transcribed, and a phenomenological data analysis method was used to support the findings of the conversations recorded during the interviews. Significant statements that were highlighted by any family members or children with PWS were gathered from the group interviews and were categorized into meaningful themes pertaining to subjective connotations and interpretations of eating habits, changes, and the socio-culturally embedded nature of family experiences. Significant statements were identified through a process of iterative coding and categorization of the transcribed interviews and observations. The significance of these remarks was determined by their ability to offer perspectives on the real-life experiences of the family members and children with PWS, and their contribution. The identification of significant statements was not exclusively determined by their frequency, but rather by their pertinence and depth in addressing the research objectives. The identification and development of themes were achieved through a collaborative process that engaged by multiple investigators. At first, each investigator analyzes the transcript separately to uncover initial themes that arose from the data. Following this, the researchers gathered to compare and integrate their respective coding techniques to reach a consensus on the most significant themes that encapsulated the fundamental nature of the data. This collaborative approach ensured the reliability and validity of the thematic analysis and minimizing researcher biasesness. Moreover, it is crucial to acknowledge that the execution of the theme analysis procedure was done by a collective of researchers possessing varied proficiencies in the fields of sociology, psychology, and public health. The incorporation of several fields of study enhanced the analysis by enabling detailed interpretations of the data from different viewpoints and theoretical frameworks. To ensure reflexivity and rigor in the interpretation of the findings, regular debriefing sessions and regular discussions were performed throughout the analytic process. The data were derived from eight families who participated in the study. There were one Indian, two Chinese, and five Malay families with children with PWS aged between 2 and 24 years. The number of participants in each session ranged from four to 10. In all, 53 individuals participated in the meals organized at the Social Behavioural Lab at Taylor’s University. Two families brought their domestic helpers, while extended family members included the aunts, uncles, grandparents, and cousins of the children with PWS. In terms food management strategies and socialization among families in Malaysia, the data revealed that the families tend to rely on experts as soon as their child was diagnosed with PWS, though at a varying degree. It is not uncommon for the families in this study to seek advice from pediatricians, dieticians, geneticists, PWS support communities, among others, when they first learned about the rare condition of their child. However, the data also showed that the families do curate their own management strategies taking into social and cultural context, innovating the professional recommendations given. Below are two example that illustrate the process of familialisation among the interviewed respondents. Strategies employed by the families are indicated in brackets within the case studies, with further elaboration and categorisation provided in <xref rid=""pone.0307874.t002"" ref-type=""table"">Table 2</xref>. Adopting the lens of familialisation, many of the strategies used by parents to manage food habits are based on expert advice. Some families were frequent clients of PWS clinic organized by University of Malaya Medical Centre (UMMC) to support families with PWS children. Through these visits, the family members learned not only about the development of their children and their current health status from the pediatricians and geneticists, but they also met the physiotherapists and nutritionists/dietitians who would provide important information to enable the families to rethink their food management. The advice not only shaped the perspectives of the immediate family members; but also influenced informal conversations with other parents including international social support groups. The support provided by the PWSAM was highlighted by some of these families as an important source of information. Because most of them are active members of the association, they reported that their involvement allows them to keep abreast with the latest happenings around the world through writing and sharing through the association. The family members shared how they learned not only how to manage similar cases, but also about other potential behaviors that their child may exhibit in the future according to their developmental stage. This information enables them to further strategize the food management behaviors of their children with PWS in addition to the entire family and caregivers. The strategies identified reflect the learning of rules and internalization of food behavior among individuals with PWS. The strategies allow them to learn about acceptable table manners (distraction), food intake behaviors (instill self-regulation, fruits and vegetables system, bowl system), food gratification (cheat day, little bits system), and feeding dynamics when eating with others (i.e., the feeding rotation among family members and domestic helpers, cleaning-up system, food for all). The data findings reflect learning beyond the table norms and household for these families. Referring to Malaysian culture, some families reasoned that it is important that they allowed their children to be treated as “normal” and not deprive them of local delicacies. Although they understand the importance of “controlling” the food [<xref rid=""pone.0307874.ref007"" ref-type=""bibr"">7</xref>], hence the bowl system, cleaning system, and scheduling [<xref rid=""pone.0307874.ref046"" ref-type=""bibr"">46</xref>], they also tolerate cakes, curry, <italic toggle=""yes"">masak lemak</italic>, and ice-cream as part of the little bits system or a cheat day. These strategies may not be ideal according to the recommendations of scholars [<xref rid=""pone.0307874.ref007"" ref-type=""bibr"">7</xref>, <xref rid=""pone.0307874.ref009"" ref-type=""bibr"">9</xref>] or medical practitioners; however, these strategies were reported to have been effective for these families to help them avoid meltdowns or self-guilt. Other cultural factors that influenced food management strategies include the understanding of food culture when visiting others or as practiced by their extended family members. Because Malaysia is known for its hospitality regarding food for guests and family members, it is hard for some caregivers to cut off children with PWS from certain foods completely. Five families mentioned their allowance for the little bits system or providing similar food for the child with PWS (i.e., food for all), especially when they eat with guests or extended family members. This is even more challenging for families with extended families involved in daily caregiving and preparing meals for these children, which is common among Asians [<xref rid=""pone.0307874.ref017"" ref-type=""bibr"">17</xref>] and was evident among the observed respondents. They believed these strategies would allow them to maneuver their cultural consciousness without excluding the child with PWS and uphold their cultural practices. The cultural aspect extends beyond daily events to special occasions and festivities, such as birthday parties, Eid celebrations, Chinese New Year, and Deepavali. Although one family reported limiting such exposure in the earlier years for their child with PWS, others partook in these events alongside their child with PWS throughout their development. Most of the family members reported that they “briefed” the hosts/family members on the condition of their child and their diet restrictions as a mechanism to manage their food intake. A few parents declared that they adopted a strict parenting approach regarding food management to ensure the well-being of their child and to keep them safe. However, several families opted for the cheat day management strategy for these special days. They acknowledged the cultural norms and believed that they should lax their control in these “once in a while” events. One of the respondents reported the pressure to enable such eating practices during family events due to comments from their elderly relatives and in-laws suggesting that they allow the child to enjoy such events. Though these findings provide useful insights into the familialisation of food management and food socialization, it is imperative to also note the limitation of this research. First, since the participants were only recruited through PWSAM and UMMC, they may not be representative of the entire population of study. Second, the interview approach and meal observations, though well designed and done thoroughly, may not cover all PWS families’ experiences and concerns. And third, monitoring meals in a behavioral lab may not accurately reflect home mealtime dynamics and hence may affect the observation data. Despite these limitations, this research provides a fundamental understanding on the complex relationship between familial dynamics, cultural influences, and eating behavior control in Malaysian children with PWS. The findings presented in this study showcase the process of familialisation by families who (re)gained control from medical care experts to (re)arrange family life, internalization of food norms, and (re)organize family roles. The data obtained in this study should be considered in the process of developing behavioral interventions and remedial measures. It is evident that managing the food intake of a child with PWS is complex as the concern extends beyond the selection of food or the determination of the caregivers to control food intake. The intervention should consider the family norms, the roles of significant others, exposure to information, and interpretation of cultural expectations and social experiences. Creating a system that is recognized by all members reduces stress and tension between caregivers/family members and their child with PWS. The internalized strategies empower individuals with PWS to operationalize their food habits and gain control over their lives. This in turn enhances the quality of life of both the caregivers/family members and the individuals with PWS.",N/A,30 8 2024
Is Oxytocin a Contributor to Behavioral and Metabolic Features in Prader–Willi Syndrome?,"Prader–Willi Syndrome (PWS) is a rare genetic disorder typically characterized by decreased social interaction, hyperphagia, poor behavioral control and temper tantrums, together with a high risk of morbid obesity unless food intake is controlled. The genetic defects that cause PWS include paternal 15q deletion (estimated in 60% of cases), chromosome 15 maternal uniparental disomy (UPD) (estimated in 35% of cases) and imprinting defects and translocations. Several studies indicate an oxytocin deficiency in PWS. Oxytocin is a hypothalamic nonapeptide with receptors located in the brain and in various other tissues in the body. It acts as a neuropeptide in several brain areas of great importance for behavioral and metabolic effects, as well as a neurohypophyseal hormone released into the circulation. Oxytocin in both rats and humans has strong and long-lasting behavioral and metabolic effects. Thus, an oxytocin deficiency might be involved in several of the behavioral and metabolic symptoms characterizing PWS. Treatment with oxytocin has, in some studies, shown improvement in psycho-social behavior and hyperphagia in individuals with PWS. This review focus on the behavioral and metabolic effects of oxytocin, the symptoms of a potential oxytocin deficiency in PWS and the effects of oxytocin treatment.","Prader–Willi syndrome (PWS) is a rare, genetic, neurodevelopmental disorder with a complex phenotype. It occurs in approximately 1 in 10,000 to 1 in 30,000 births and is caused by a defect in the paternal expression of imprinted genes in chromosome 15 in the region q11–13. The most common defect (60%) is paternal deletion, followed by maternal disomy (35%). The remaining defects are imprinting defects, translocations, or inversions. The majority of cases occur spontaneously, and the incidence is anticipated to be the same worldwide, although data are only available for a few countries. PWS is characterized by muscular hypotonia, motor, and cognitive developmental delays, mild to moderate intellectual disability, behavioral problems, including anxiety, compulsive and controlling behavior and temper outbursts. Hormone deficiencies are common, in particular, hypogonadism and growth hormone (GH) deficiency, leading to a short stature unless GH is administered during childhood. Most infants with PWS have feeding problems, which are switched to hyperphagia at the age of 4 to 6 years. Body composition is abnormal with more body fat than muscle mass, and the metabolic rate is low. Due to the hyperphagia, a strict diet and supervised food intake are mandatory to prevent extreme obesity and related comorbidity [<xref rid=""B1-cimb-46-00518"" ref-type=""bibr"">1</xref>]. PWS is believed to be a hypothalamic disease, and studies of postmortem brain tissue from adults with PWS have shown a 42% decrease in number and a 54% decrease in volume of oxytocin-expressing neurons in the paraventricular nucleus (PVN) of the hypothalamus suggested to be the cause for the insatiable hunger and decreased satiety in PWS [<xref rid=""B2-cimb-46-00518"" ref-type=""bibr"">2</xref>,<xref rid=""B3-cimb-46-00518"" ref-type=""bibr"">3</xref>]. Very low concentrations of oxytocin in lymphoblastoid cells and in postmortem frontal cortex tissue were also demonstrated [<xref rid=""B4-cimb-46-00518"" ref-type=""bibr"">4</xref>]. Thus, low plasma levels of oxytocin would be expected, but oxytocin is often reported to be increased in children with PWS. In a study of plasma levels of oxytocin, 23 children with PWS were compared with 18 healthy unrelated siblings matched for age and with a similar gender ratio and BMI. The children with PWS were found to have more than twice as high levels of plasma oxytocin as compared to unrelated siblings [<xref rid=""B5-cimb-46-00518"" ref-type=""bibr"">5</xref>], and analyses of serum oxytocin in adults with PWS showed similar concentrations as in controls, but, in relation to their obesity, the concentrations were low [<xref rid=""B6-cimb-46-00518"" ref-type=""bibr"">6</xref>]. In addition, analyses of oxytocin in cerebrospinal fluid showed higher concentrations in adolescents and adults with PWS compared to the controls [<xref rid=""B7-cimb-46-00518"" ref-type=""bibr"">7</xref>]. The 15q11–13 region contains both protein-coding DNA genes and non-coding RNA genes. Mutations or deletions of genes in this region (Magel2 and Necdin) are in mouse models associated with hypotonia, developmental delay, hypogonadism, hyperphagia and impaired social skills. A pronounced dysregulation of the signaling pathways for oxytocin has been shown in a mouse model of PWS, and, in this model, an early postnatal administration of oxytocin improved social behavior [<xref rid=""B8-cimb-46-00518"" ref-type=""bibr"">8</xref>]. In humans with PWS, several trials studying the intranasal administration of oxytocin have been performed. The study cohorts varied regarding age, oxytocin dose and gender, and the studies have shown varying degrees of efficacy on hyperphagia, anxiousness, distress and social behavior. In a recent systematic review and meta-analysis on the efficacy of intranasal oxytocin in individuals with PWS, four studies with 56 individuals receiving oxytocin, and 61 individuals receiving placebo, were included [<xref rid=""B9-cimb-46-00518"" ref-type=""bibr"">9</xref>]. Pooled data from 92 individuals did not show a better effect of oxytocin on hyperphagia compared to placebo. In the same meta-analysis, pooled data from 94 individuals showed that the effect of oxytocin on weight was not different from placebo. However, in studies of children <11 years, oxytocin significantly reduced hyperphagia, especially in boys, whereas no effect was observed in individuals between 13 and 29 years suggesting a better effect in younger children [<xref rid=""B9-cimb-46-00518"" ref-type=""bibr"">9</xref>]. Oxytocin is a neurotransmitter and neurohypophyseal hormone. Besides the classical effects on uterine contraction and milk ejection during labor and breastfeeding, oxytocin has many other effects. Oxytocin has behavioral and metabolic effects in both sexes and has been suggested to influence, for example, anxiety and compulsive and social behavior, as well as eating behavior. It also interacts with a number of other neuropeptides and hormones of importance for behavior and metabolism. Thus, a decrease or change in oxytocin synthesis or distribution could be involved in several of the symptoms in PWS described above. In the present review, similarities between low levels of oxytocin and symptoms in PWS and their possible relationships will be discussed. PWS is a multisymptomatic syndrome with clinical features varying with age (<xref rid=""cimb-46-00518-t001"" ref-type=""table"">Table 1</xref>) [<xref rid=""B10-cimb-46-00518"" ref-type=""bibr"">10</xref>,<xref rid=""B11-cimb-46-00518"" ref-type=""bibr"">11</xref>]. Typical dysmorphic features include a long narrow face, narrow bifrontal diameter, almond-shaped palpebral fissures, and a small mouth with a thin upper lip, small feet for height and age and small narrow hands with a straight ulnar border. The neonatal period is characterized by profound muscular hypotonia, a poor sucking reflex and failure to thrive. During infancy, muscular hypotonia improves, and a mild to moderate intellectual dysfunction and delayed psychomotor development become increasingly apparent along with impaired skeletal growth. Central and obstructive sleep apnea as well as excessive daytime sleepiness are common. During childhood, hyperphagia develops and a constantly supervised and restricted diet together with scheduled daily physical activities are necessary to avoid morbid obesity. Body composition is abnormal in PWS with more body fat than lean body mass. Most patients with PWS have genital hypoplasia and hypogonadism, which can be of both primary gonadal and hypothalamic origin. Delayed and incomplete pubertal development is common, and a decreased or absent growth spurt results in reduced final adult height. Typically starting in childhood are temper tantrums, a stubborn and controlling behavior, compulsive–obsessive features and a very strong preference for routines. Psychiatric and behavioral problems become more prominent with increasing age and are, together with the patient’s hyperphagia and cognitive disabilities, the main limitations to independent living for adults with PWS. PWS is characterized by severe hypotonia and failure to thrive in infancy, which is replaced by progressive hyperphagia and a high risk of development of morbid obesity. For many years, only those two nutritional phases were believed to be present in PWS. However, in 2011, Miller et al. described seven different nutritional phases, five main phases and two sub-phases [<xref rid=""B12-cimb-46-00518"" ref-type=""bibr"">12</xref>]. This description of the nutritional phases in PWS has greatly improved our understanding of its natural history. Briefly, phase 0 occurs in utero, with decreased fetal movements and growth restriction. In phase 1, the infant is hypotonic and not obese. In sub-phase 1a, the infant has difficulty eating with or without failure to thrive (birth to 15 months). In sub-phase 1b, the infant grows steadily, and weight is increasing at a normal rate (the median age of onset: 9 months). In phase 2, weight increases. In sub-phase 2a, the weight increases without a significant change in appetite or caloric intake (the median age of onset: 2 years), while, in sub-phase 2b, the weight gain is associated with an increased interest in food (the median age of onset: 4.5 years). Phase 3 is characterized by hyperphagia, with the typical food-seeking behavior and a lack of satiety (the median age of onset: 8 years). Some adults progress to phase 4 where the appetite is no longer insatiable. PWS is a complex model to study and understand the development of obesity and appetite regulation due to the different nutritional phases that individuals with PWS undergo, from anorexia and failure to thrive in phase 1a to hyperphagia and the lack of satiety in phase 3. Oxytocin is a nonapeptide produced within two hypothalamic nuclei, the supraoptical nucleus (SON) and the PVN. There is a broad spectrum of nerves connecting the neurons within the PVN with neurons in several brain areas including other parts of the hypothalamus such as the ventromedial nucleus and the arcuate nucleus and the brainstem where also oxytocin receptors are located. Oxytocin receptors are also found in many other areas within the body for example the endocrine pancreas, the adipose tissue, liver, muscles as well as the gastrointestinal tract [<xref rid=""B13-cimb-46-00518"" ref-type=""bibr"">13</xref>,<xref rid=""B14-cimb-46-00518"" ref-type=""bibr"">14</xref>,<xref rid=""B15-cimb-46-00518"" ref-type=""bibr"">15</xref>,<xref rid=""B16-cimb-46-00518"" ref-type=""bibr"">16</xref>,<xref rid=""B17-cimb-46-00518"" ref-type=""bibr"">17</xref>]. In addition to being released during parturition and breastfeeding oxytocin is released in response to a number of other stimuli, induces a multitude of effects and influences several other hormones and neurotransmitters. Besides being released as a hormone from the neurohypophysis, oxytocin is as mentioned above, released into the brain and then not only from the axon into the synaptic cleft but also from the dendrites spreading oxytocin in the extracellular fluid making it possible to reach larger areas. It has even been shown that oxytocin may be produced within the dendrites [<xref rid=""B18-cimb-46-00518"" ref-type=""bibr"">18</xref>]. Oxytocin is measurable in human plasma but of importance to remember is that concentrations in peripheral blood do not always reflect the concentrations within the CNS or the cerebrospinal fluid. In this review we will focus on the effects of oxytocin on metabolism and behavior. Such effects were demonstrated during the 1960s–1980s, when oxytocin was reported to induce maternal and sexual behavior, to influence feeding and foraging, gluconeogenesis and glucogenolysis, as well as the release of insulin and several gastrointestinal hormones (for a review see for example [<xref rid=""B19-cimb-46-00518"" ref-type=""bibr"">19</xref>,<xref rid=""B20-cimb-46-00518"" ref-type=""bibr"">20</xref>]. Oxytocin may, during certain circumstances, induce insulin-like effects where it stimulates glucose uptake, as well as lipogenesis, through effects on oxytocin receptors in the adipose tissue [<xref rid=""B13-cimb-46-00518"" ref-type=""bibr"">13</xref>,<xref rid=""B21-cimb-46-00518"" ref-type=""bibr"">21</xref>,<xref rid=""B22-cimb-46-00518"" ref-type=""bibr"">22</xref>]. On the other hand, oxytocin has also been demonstrated to be released in response to hypoglycemia and to increase blood glucose [<xref rid=""B21-cimb-46-00518"" ref-type=""bibr"">21</xref>,<xref rid=""B23-cimb-46-00518"" ref-type=""bibr"">23</xref>] by stimulating both glycogenolysis and gluconeogenesis [<xref rid=""B24-cimb-46-00518"" ref-type=""bibr"">24</xref>,<xref rid=""B25-cimb-46-00518"" ref-type=""bibr"">25</xref>], and it may also stimulate lipolysis [<xref rid=""B26-cimb-46-00518"" ref-type=""bibr"">26</xref>]. Interestingly, the effect on lipolysis has been suggested to be induced by a subpopulation of oxytocinergic neurons located in the adipose tissue interacting with noradrenaline release [<xref rid=""B26-cimb-46-00518"" ref-type=""bibr"">26</xref>]. Oxytocin has also been demonstrated to release insulin through effects within the endocrine pancreas [<xref rid=""B27-cimb-46-00518"" ref-type=""bibr"">27</xref>] and the dorsal motor nucleus (DMX) [<xref rid=""B28-cimb-46-00518"" ref-type=""bibr"">28</xref>]. However, an opposite effect on insulin release has been demonstrated when oxytocin is injected into the dorsal vagal complex (DVC) where oxytocin decreases insulin [<xref rid=""B29-cimb-46-00518"" ref-type=""bibr"">29</xref>]. In rats, the increase in glucose and glucagon during suckling was attenuated in response to an oxytocin antagonist [<xref rid=""B28-cimb-46-00518"" ref-type=""bibr"">28</xref>]. It is reasonable that oxytocin may have dual effects on metabolism: one during breastfeeding and another during nonpregnant/nonbreastfeeding states, and it has been suggested that oxytocin may take part in the mobilization and transfer of energy in the production of milk during lactation [<xref rid=""B30-cimb-46-00518"" ref-type=""bibr"">30</xref>]. Oxytocin increases the proliferation and differentiation of osteoblasts [<xref rid=""B31-cimb-46-00518"" ref-type=""bibr"">31</xref>,<xref rid=""B32-cimb-46-00518"" ref-type=""bibr"">32</xref>], and, in muscles, oxytocin seems to have both anabolic and protective effects [<xref rid=""B33-cimb-46-00518"" ref-type=""bibr"">33</xref>]. An anabolic effect of oxytocin on bone and muscles during breastfeeding might serve to protect the breastfeeding mother against a too large breakdown of bone and muscles during this period with high prolactin and decreased estrogen levels. In a short-term perspective, both the stimulating and inhibiting effects of oxytocin on the release of GH and insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) have been demonstrated, but, in a long-term perspective, oxytocin seems to increase the plasma levels of IGF-1 [<xref rid=""B34-cimb-46-00518"" ref-type=""bibr"">34</xref>,<xref rid=""B35-cimb-46-00518"" ref-type=""bibr"">35</xref>]. Similarly, opposite effects of oxytocin have been reported on food intake and weight gain. In female rats, these effects are dependent on estrogen levels, dose and the route of administration [<xref rid=""B36-cimb-46-00518"" ref-type=""bibr"">36</xref>,<xref rid=""B37-cimb-46-00518"" ref-type=""bibr"">37</xref>]. In ovariectomized (OVX) rats, a decrease in weight in response to oxytocin has been demonstrated [<xref rid=""B38-cimb-46-00518"" ref-type=""bibr"">38</xref>,<xref rid=""B39-cimb-46-00518"" ref-type=""bibr"">39</xref>]. In humans, lower levels of oxytocin were found in postmenopausal women compared to premenopausal women and in obese women compared to women of normal weight [<xref rid=""B40-cimb-46-00518"" ref-type=""bibr"">40</xref>]. Several recent studies have focused on oxytocin as a weight reducing hormone, changing metabolism, decreasing food intake and increasing energy expenditure [<xref rid=""B41-cimb-46-00518"" ref-type=""bibr"">41</xref>]. However, from a physiological point of view this would not be advantageous during pregnancy and breastfeeding, but, as discussed above, oxytocin might have different effects depending on the situation and hormonal background. Oxytocin receptors and oxytocinergic neurons projecting to other areas within the hypothalamus and the brainstem have been demonstrated, and, within these areas, oxytocin can influence metabolism through effects on other hormones and neurotransmitters, as well as the activity within the autonomic nervous system. Within the hypothalamus, oxytocinergic neurons reach other nuclei of importance for metabolism such as the ventromedial hypothalamic nucleus and the arcuate nuclei, and, in the brainstem, both vagal and sympathetic areas are reached by the oxytocinergic neurons where oxytocin receptors are also located. Within the hypothalamus, oxytocin has also been demonstrated to be released from somatodendrites spreading oxytocin within this area [<xref rid=""B14-cimb-46-00518"" ref-type=""bibr"">14</xref>,<xref rid=""B16-cimb-46-00518"" ref-type=""bibr"">16</xref>,<xref rid=""B42-cimb-46-00518"" ref-type=""bibr"">42</xref>]. Oxytocin receptors are widespread in the periphery and present in, for example, the liver and the gastrointestinal tract, the endocrine part of the pancreas and muscles, as well as adipocytes [<xref rid=""B14-cimb-46-00518"" ref-type=""bibr"">14</xref>,<xref rid=""B15-cimb-46-00518"" ref-type=""bibr"">15</xref>,<xref rid=""B16-cimb-46-00518"" ref-type=""bibr"">16</xref>,<xref rid=""B17-cimb-46-00518"" ref-type=""bibr"">17</xref>]. The increase in metabolism and decrease in food intake have been suggested to be induced by an increase in activity within the sympathetic nervous system [<xref rid=""B41-cimb-46-00518"" ref-type=""bibr"">41</xref>]. Indeed, in a mouse model deficient in oxytocin receptors, a low sympathetic tone and increased weight without an increase in food intake were seen [<xref rid=""B43-cimb-46-00518"" ref-type=""bibr"">43</xref>]. An increase in activity within the sympathetic nervous system related to oxytocin might be true during certain circumstances, although, in contrast, oxytocin is also referred to as an anti-stress hormone since it decreases blood pressure and the activity within the hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal (HPA)-axis. Additionally, during breastfeeding, oxytocin increases vagal nerve activity. Moreover, in rats, oxytocin decreases the activity within the locus coeruleus and increases the responsiveness of alpha 2-adrenoreceptors [<xref rid=""B44-cimb-46-00518"" ref-type=""bibr"">44</xref>,<xref rid=""B45-cimb-46-00518"" ref-type=""bibr"">45</xref>,<xref rid=""B46-cimb-46-00518"" ref-type=""bibr"">46</xref>]. When oxytocin is administered postnatally to rats, a lifelong change with lower blood pressure and increased responsiveness of alpha 2-adrenoreceptors have been reported, while changes in weight seem to depend on sex and strain [<xref rid=""B47-cimb-46-00518"" ref-type=""bibr"">47</xref>,<xref rid=""B48-cimb-46-00518"" ref-type=""bibr"">48</xref>,<xref rid=""B49-cimb-46-00518"" ref-type=""bibr"">49</xref>]. In hypothalamus, both the melanocyte stimulating hormone (MSH) and leptin have been demonstrated to affect oxytocin release from the PVN [<xref rid=""B50-cimb-46-00518"" ref-type=""bibr"">50</xref>,<xref rid=""B51-cimb-46-00518"" ref-type=""bibr"">51</xref>]. There seems also to be correlations and interactions between GLP-1 and oxytocin [<xref rid=""B52-cimb-46-00518"" ref-type=""bibr"">52</xref>,<xref rid=""B53-cimb-46-00518"" ref-type=""bibr"">53</xref>]. When oxytocin was administered to rats, an increase in the hunger hormone ghrelin [<xref rid=""B54-cimb-46-00518"" ref-type=""bibr"">54</xref>] and lower levels of thyroid hormones have been reported [<xref rid=""B55-cimb-46-00518"" ref-type=""bibr"">55</xref>]. In contrast, individuals with PWS have higher ghrelin levels and, more frequently, a central hypothyreosis compared to non-PWS individuals. Concerning the effects of oxytocin on body weight, conflicting results have been described in an overview of studies of oxytocin in humans [<xref rid=""B41-cimb-46-00518"" ref-type=""bibr"">41</xref>]. Interestingly, in a study on obese non-PWS individuals treated with oxytocin intranasally four times a day for 8 weeks, weight decreased significantly, with the most pronounced weight loss in the most obese individuals. In individuals with a normal BMI, no weight loss was seen [<xref rid=""B56-cimb-46-00518"" ref-type=""bibr"">56</xref>]. Furthermore, in diabetic mice, oxytocin administration decreased weight and food intake and improved glucose and fat metabolism. Meanwhile, his was not observed in non-diabetic controls [<xref rid=""B57-cimb-46-00518"" ref-type=""bibr"">57</xref>]. Thus, as discussed above, oxytocin might have different metabolic effects depending on the physiological and experimental context. Effects may differ, for example, depending on time, gender, age, other hormones or stress, as well as if the individual is in a fed or fasting state. In PWS, metabolism is decreased, and body composition is different, with more body fat than lean body mass, while glucose metabolism is usually normal [<xref rid=""B10-cimb-46-00518"" ref-type=""bibr"">10</xref>]. It is likely that oxytocin, through various central and peripheral effects, plays a role for at least some of the symptoms seen in PWS, although there are several other hormones that are stronger regulators of metabolism. The first behavioral effects of oxytocin that were described were the effects on maternal behavior and bonding between mother and offspring/child [<xref rid=""B58-cimb-46-00518"" ref-type=""bibr"">58</xref>,<xref rid=""B59-cimb-46-00518"" ref-type=""bibr"">59</xref>]. Oxytocin is released not only in response to the milk ejection reflex but also in response to the early skin-to-skin contact between mother and child, which are important for the bonding. A similar release of oxytocin in response to skin-to-skin contact has been demonstrated also in fathers [<xref rid=""B60-cimb-46-00518"" ref-type=""bibr"">60</xref>,<xref rid=""B61-cimb-46-00518"" ref-type=""bibr"">61</xref>]. As discussed above, in relation to the effects of oxytocin on metabolism and weight, likewise, oxytocin seems to have dual effects also in some aspects of behavior. In rats, oxytocin can induce both anxiolytic-like and sedative effects depending on dose and the route of administration but also depending on the stage of the estrous cycle [<xref rid=""B37-cimb-46-00518"" ref-type=""bibr"">37</xref>,<xref rid=""B62-cimb-46-00518"" ref-type=""bibr"">62</xref>], and oxytocin administered postnatally to pigs and rats induces lifelong behavioral changes [<xref rid=""B47-cimb-46-00518"" ref-type=""bibr"">47</xref>,<xref rid=""B49-cimb-46-00518"" ref-type=""bibr"">49</xref>,<xref rid=""B63-cimb-46-00518"" ref-type=""bibr"">63</xref>]. In rats and mice, oxytocin induces grooming, sexual and social behavior, and it decreases aggression. Animal studies suggest that oxytocin increases social interaction by decreasing activity within the amygdala. In an animal model of depression, oxytocin has been found to induce similar effects as antidepressant medication [<xref rid=""B64-cimb-46-00518"" ref-type=""bibr"">64</xref>]. There are many studies indicating that oxytocin plays a role for several behaviors in humans since oxytocin levels have been demonstrated to be associated with social behavior, anxiety, sexual activity, depression, trust and decision making (for reviews, see, for example [<xref rid=""B19-cimb-46-00518"" ref-type=""bibr"">19</xref>,<xref rid=""B65-cimb-46-00518"" ref-type=""bibr"">65</xref>]). Oxytocin levels are lower in female patients with depression [<xref rid=""B66-cimb-46-00518"" ref-type=""bibr"">66</xref>], and, in some but not all studies, oxytocin has been reported to improve depression [<xref rid=""B67-cimb-46-00518"" ref-type=""bibr"">67</xref>,<xref rid=""B68-cimb-46-00518"" ref-type=""bibr"">68</xref>,<xref rid=""B69-cimb-46-00518"" ref-type=""bibr"">69</xref>]. In 2005, Kosfeld et al. showed that oxytocin administered intranasally could increase trust in humans, and, approximately ten years later, Lambert al. used an MRI to demonstrate that oxytocin affects decision making [<xref rid=""B70-cimb-46-00518"" ref-type=""bibr"">70</xref>,<xref rid=""B71-cimb-46-00518"" ref-type=""bibr"">71</xref>]. In another experimental setting, children exposed to a situation of social stress were tested. As a result, the children who could see or hear their mother’s voice had higher levels of oxytocin and lower levels of cortisol compared to the children who had no contact with their mother [<xref rid=""B72-cimb-46-00518"" ref-type=""bibr"">72</xref>]. Oxytocin has also been suggested to play a role in the symptoms related to autism spectrum disorders [<xref rid=""B73-cimb-46-00518"" ref-type=""bibr"">73</xref>], and, interestingly, oxytocin was found to reduce increased activity in the amygdala in response to angry faces in participants with autism-spectrum disorders [<xref rid=""B74-cimb-46-00518"" ref-type=""bibr"">74</xref>]. In a meta-analysis [<xref rid=""B75-cimb-46-00518"" ref-type=""bibr"">75</xref>], lower oxytocin levels were found in children but not in adolescents with autism, and, in some studies, the administration of oxytocin was reported to improve social behavior in these individuals. In a mouse model of autism, oxytocin administered neonatally restored social behavior [<xref rid=""B76-cimb-46-00518"" ref-type=""bibr"">76</xref>]. The above-mentioned effects might be induced by oxytocin itself, but it could also involve other hormones and neurotransmitters. Oxytocin neurons reach several brain areas of importance for behavior such as the frontal cortex, the amygdala, the hippocampus and the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis where oxytocin receptors are expressed [<xref rid=""B14-cimb-46-00518"" ref-type=""bibr"">14</xref>,<xref rid=""B16-cimb-46-00518"" ref-type=""bibr"">16</xref>]. For example, oxytocin increases the activity within 5HT1a/5HT2a and 5HT2c-receptors [<xref rid=""B77-cimb-46-00518"" ref-type=""bibr"">77</xref>,<xref rid=""B78-cimb-46-00518"" ref-type=""bibr"">78</xref>,<xref rid=""B79-cimb-46-00518"" ref-type=""bibr"">79</xref>], as well as the responsiveness of alpha 2-adrenoreceptors, and decreases the activity within the HPA axis. In rats, oxytocin can affect the number of glucocorticoid receptors within for example the hippocampus [<xref rid=""B80-cimb-46-00518"" ref-type=""bibr"">80</xref>]. In addition, oxytocin may influence dopaminergic receptors and dopaminergic transmission [<xref rid=""B81-cimb-46-00518"" ref-type=""bibr"">81</xref>], and the effect on anxiety by oxytocin has been suggested to involve GABA-A-receptors [<xref rid=""B82-cimb-46-00518"" ref-type=""bibr"">82</xref>]. It could be speculated that a deficiency or change in oxytocin levels or signaling might explain some of the behavioral challenges seen in PWS. Low levels of oxytocin are associated with anxiety, less social interaction, and less calmness, all behaviors common in PWS. In addition, individuals with PWS have changes in their GABA-A-receptors, a lower activity within the HPA axis and the serotoninergic transmission where especially the 5HT2C-receptors have been thought to play a role in PWS [<xref rid=""B83-cimb-46-00518"" ref-type=""bibr"">83</xref>]. Similar changes have also been linked to oxytocin levels or oxytocin administration as discussed above. In accordance with the effect of oxytocin administered early in life that were discussed above, oxytocin administered within 5 min after birth in a mouse model of PWS induced long-term changes since it normalized both learning and memory as well as social cognition in the mice [<xref rid=""B84-cimb-46-00518"" ref-type=""bibr"">84</xref>]. Altogether, the behavioral alterations in PWS and the effects of oxytocin observed on those have been a great inspiration for clinical trials of oxytocin in PWS, as described below.  Oxytocin has a lot of effects on metabolism and behavior, including hyperphagia, but the magnitude of these effects depends on the situation and context. These symptoms are a major challenge in PWS, and, as studies have demonstrated low concentrations of oxytocin in PWS, oxytocin is, therefore, potentially an attractive treatment. In some of the clinical trials performed with oxytocin on individuals with PWS, anxiety and compulsiveness decreased. Hyperphagia could be considered as a compulsive behavior, and it also improved in some of the studies. Recent studies with the oxytocin analogue carbetocin showed similar effects with improvements in hyperphagia and behavior. Worth mentioning is that, in non-PWS individuals with obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD), changes in the oxytocin receptor have been found, and a methylation of the oxytocin receptor has even been suggested as a biomarker for the response to the treatment of OCD [<xref rid=""B94-cimb-46-00518"" ref-type=""bibr"">94</xref>]. To our knowledge, no study has shown an effect of oxytocin on weight in PWS. However, if oxytocin is administered during a longer period, it might, at least in younger patients, have the potential to decrease weight or protect against further weight gain since oxytocin, as discussed above, in several studies decreased hyperphagia. Thus, oxytocin seems to positively affect behavior in PWS, at least during certain circumstances and especially if administered early in life. Oxytocin is an interesting peptide that seems to modulate and balance many behavioral and metabolic effects to keep the homeostasis. Since oxytocin is influenced by and is influencing several other neurotransmitters and hormones, the effects seen in response to oxytocin may not always be caused by oxytocin itself. Oxytocin interacts directly or indirectly with GABA-receptors, 5HT-receptors, dopamine receptors, glucocorticoid receptors and the HPA axis, as well as adrenergic receptors and the autonomic nervous system. To further understand the role of oxytocin in PWS, more studies of these interactions are needed as well as studies of the effects of oxytocin during different ages and in the PWS of different genotype. For example, PWS individuals with maternal disomy 15 often have delayed diagnosis, higher verbal IQ scores with greater attention, factual knowledge and better social reasoning skills than those with the typical Type I or Type II deletions involving the 15q11-q13 region. On the other hand, patients with maternal disomy are more prone to increased episodes of psychosis and autistic behaviors [<xref rid=""B10-cimb-46-00518"" ref-type=""bibr"">10</xref>]. Indeed, in a study by Damen et al. [<xref rid=""B90-cimb-46-00518"" ref-type=""bibr"">90</xref>], an effect of oxytocin was only seen in the PWS with the 15q11-q13 deletion and not in the PWS with the maternal disomy, but these results need to be repeated in larger cohorts. Further studies of different ages are also of importance since oxytocin seems to have effects in particular in the youngest children. Perhaps it should be administered as early as during the neonatal period since oxytocin, when administered early in life, in animal experiments induces long-lasting and even lifelong effects, but more studies are needed. Also, the beneficial effects of oxytocin in human infants younger than 6 months need to be better established. Other unanswered questions are what dose of oxytocin to use to be the most effective and what the long-term consequences of oxytocin treatment are. Oxytocin has a very short half-life. Different doses and administration intervals have been used in previous studies. Carbetocin has an increased half-life compared to oxytocin and crosses the blood–brain barrier more easily. It is unclear if diurnal fluctuations in oxytocin concentrations are an asset and if high concentrations can introduce a state of resistance. Future studies with varying doses and numbers of administrations will be of value to answer these questions.",N/A,13 8 2024
Case Report: Plummer's adenoma in Prader–Willi syndrome,"Thyroid nodules in children are less common than in adults but they are approximately two- to three-fold more likely to be malignant in children. Among thyroid nodular diseases, Plummer's adenoma occurs very rarely in pediatrics, and currently, there is no literature providing evidence of this diagnosis in patients with Prader–Willi syndrome (PWS). We report the case of a 9-year-old Caucasian boy affected by PWS presenting with a rapidly growing palpable mass in the thyroid lodge associated with subclinical hyperthyroidism. Laboratory and other examinations (thyroid ultrasound, fine-needle aspiration of the nodule, and scintigraphy) were strongly suggestive for Plummer's adenoma; therefore, the patient underwent left hemithyroidectomy surgery, and anatomo-pathological examination confirmed the diagnosis. Our case describes the first evidence of an isolated follicular adenoma in children with PWS. Surgery is the only therapeutic option in younger children. Further evidence is needed to assess the possible correlation between these two conditions and the existence of potential risk factors.","Thyroid nodular disease is very rare at pediatric ages. Approximately 2% of children and adolescents have palpable thyroid nodules and 0.5%–5% have ultrasonography-demonstrated nodules in the gland (<xref rid=""B1"" ref-type=""bibr"">1</xref>–<xref rid=""B3"" ref-type=""bibr"">3</xref>). Most thyroid nodules in children are benign but approximately 26% represent a differentiated thyroid cancer (DTC); therefore, although thyroid nodules in children are less common than in adults, they are approximately two- to three-fold more likely to be malignant (<xref rid=""B4"" ref-type=""bibr"">4</xref>). Children with thyroid nodules should be evaluated with serum thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) and free thyroxine (fT4), and thyroid ultrasound. Usually, the majority of children are euthyroid; in this case, a fine-needle aspiration (FNA) of the nodule should be performed if it is >1 cm or, regardless of the size, there is a suspicious clinical context or there are specific ultrasound features of malignancy (<xref rid=""B5"" ref-type=""bibr"">5</xref>). Furthermore, an increase in nodule size during the follow-up is considered an index of malignancy, and it is appropriate to repeat an FNA when the previous sampling was non-diagnostic (<xref rid=""B6"" ref-type=""bibr"">6</xref>). In 5% of cases, thyroid nodules occur with hyperthyroidism; in the presence of low/suppressed TSH levels, a Plummer's adenoma (PA) is suspected and a thyroid scintigraphy should be performed (<xref rid=""B5"" ref-type=""bibr"">5</xref>). PA (or toxic adenoma or autonomous functioning thyroid adenoma) accounts for approximately 5%–10% of all solitary nodules and occurs predominantly in females (13:1), more commonly in older age groups (<xref rid=""B7"" ref-type=""bibr"">7</xref>). In children and adolescents, PA is an unusual finding but it seems to have a more rapidly progressive course than those in adults (<xref rid=""B8"" ref-type=""bibr"">8</xref>). Increased radioiodine uptake within the nodule on thyroid scintigraphy, associated with a suppression in the surrounding tissue of the gland, is consistent with PA (<xref rid=""B5"" ref-type=""bibr"">5</xref>). These lesions are most frequently associated with somatic activating mutations within the genes encoding the TSH receptor or the Gs-alpha subunit (<xref rid=""B9"" ref-type=""bibr"">9</xref>). To date, up to one-third of patients may have an incidentally discovered DTC associated with autonomous nodules. In this regard, surgical treatment (lobectomy plus isthmusectomy in most cases) is the recommended approach for most pediatric patients and patients below 10 years of age, considering that below that age, I-131 ablation is regarded as a contraindication according to the most recent European Association of Nuclear Medicine (EANM) guidelines (<xref rid=""B10"" ref-type=""bibr"">10</xref>), and it should be proposed at the time of the diagnosis (<xref rid=""B5"" ref-type=""bibr"">5</xref>). Prader–Willi Syndrome (PWS), the most common cause of genetic obesity in the pediatric population, is a complex disorder with hypothalamus-pituitary axis abnormalities (anterior pituitary hypoplasia and an absent, small, or ectopic posterior pituitary gland) in more than 50% of patients, possibly resulting in endocrinological dysfunctions [growth hormone (GH) deficiency, hypogonadotropic hypogonadism, adrenal insufficiency, and hypothyroidism] (<xref rid=""B11"" ref-type=""bibr"">11</xref>–<xref rid=""B15"" ref-type=""bibr"">15</xref>). In this regard, the most common thyroid dysfunction in PWS seems to be central hypothyroidism (CH) (<xref rid=""B16"" ref-type=""bibr"">16</xref>, <xref rid=""B17"" ref-type=""bibr"">17</xref>), the incidence of which varies from 2% to 32% (<xref rid=""B12"" ref-type=""bibr"">12</xref>, <xref rid=""B14"" ref-type=""bibr"">14</xref>, <xref rid=""B18"" ref-type=""bibr"">18</xref>, <xref rid=""B19"" ref-type=""bibr"">19</xref>). However, some authors have reported a prevalence of CH in PWS that is similar to the general population (<xref rid=""B20"" ref-type=""bibr"">20</xref>, <xref rid=""B21"" ref-type=""bibr"">21</xref>). Rare cases of congenital hypothyroidism (<xref rid=""B22"" ref-type=""bibr"">22</xref>, <xref rid=""B23"" ref-type=""bibr"">23</xref>) and fetal goiter (<xref rid=""B24"" ref-type=""bibr"">24</xref>) have been reported, whereas descriptions of hyperthyroidism cases are sporadic (<xref rid=""B25"" ref-type=""bibr"">25</xref>). To date, no PA cases in either adult or pediatric subjects with PWS have been described in the scientific literature. In this report, we describe the first case of PA reported in a child with PWS presenting as a rapidly growing thyroid nodular lesion and subclinical hyperthyroidism. A 9-year-old boy, followed at our Pediatric Endocrinology Outpatients Clinic for PWS, owing to maternal uniparental disomy for chromosome 15, presented with the appearance of a palpable non-painful mass at the left anterior cervical site in the thyroid lodge. The patient, who was receiving recombinant human growth hormone (rhGH) therapy since the age of 1 year, had regular growth in height and weight; at the time of the examination he had a stature of 130 cm (+0.05 SD), a weight of 36.7 kg (+1.48 SD), a body mass index of 21.75 kg/m<sup>2</sup> (+1.67 SD), and a regular growth rate (7.6 cm/year). The child was prepubescent in accordance with the Tanner Stage. Familial history was negative for thyroid diseases. During outpatient follow-up, thyroid function was always within normal limits and anti-thyroid antibodies were negative, as was the case at the last check-up 6 months before the diagnosis of the palpable neck mass: TSH, 1.2 uIU/ml [normal value (n.v.) 0.27–4.2]; free triiodothyronine (fT3), 3.6 pg/ml (n.v. 2.0–4.4); and fT4, 19 pmol/L (n.v. 12.0–22.0); anti-thyroglobulin (AbTg), anti-peroxidase (AbTPO), and TSH receptor (TRAb) antibodies were negative. Following the aforementioned finding, the child therefore underwent a thyroid ultrasound that documented the presence of a nodule in the left lobe [longitudinal diameter (LD), 17 mm] with a disomogeneous structure and microcalcifications, and without pathological findings at the color-Doppler evaluation (shown in <xref rid=""F1"" ref-type=""fig"">Figure 1</xref>). Thus, considering nodule dimension, in accordance with the most recent guidelines (<xref rid=""B5"" ref-type=""bibr"">5</xref>), the patient underwent a fine-needle aspiration biopsy (FNAB), which suggested a non-malignant lesion (TIR2 according to the 2014 Italian consensus for the classification of thyroid cytology) (<xref rid=""B26"" ref-type=""bibr"">26</xref>). Over approximately 6 months, thyroid biochemical assessment shifted toward a subclinical hyperthyroidism: TSH, 0.005 uIU/ml; fT4, 20.4 pmol/L; and fT3 5.79 pg/ml. Thyroid autoantibodies were still negative. At the ultrasound reassessment, the nodule had grown in size (LD, 22 mm) and increased vascular signals were evident. A second FNAB confirmed the presence of a non-malignant lesion/adenomatous struma (TIR2) (<xref rid=""B26"" ref-type=""bibr"">26</xref>). Owing to the TSH suppression, a scintigraphic examination was carried out, which documented a defined focal uptake of iodine-123 in the nodule with suppressed uptake in the rest of the gland (shown in <xref rid=""F2"" ref-type=""fig"">Figure 2</xref>). In light of the rapid and progressive increase in nodule size, the biochemical pattern of subclinical hyperthyroidism, and the scintigraphic finding of a hyper capturing nodule, the patient underwent left hemithyroidectomy surgery. The anatomo-pathological examination revealed a follicular adenoma, confirming the diagnosis of PA, that was hyperfunctioning on the basis of the hormonal profile. <xref rid=""F3"" ref-type=""fig"">Figure 3</xref> shows the timeline from the first clinical finding of the thyroid nodule to the diagnosis of PA. Two months after the surgery, the boy developed an acquired hypothyroidism, possibly due to a limited functionality of the residual thyroid tissue. Levothyroxine therapy was started. Five months after the hemithyroidectomy and the start of levothyroxine therapy, euthyroidism was maintained with a 1 μg/kg/day dose of levothyroxine. The clinical case described in this report is the first evidence of PA in a child with PWS. PA seems to be extremely rare in children and adolescents, even when referring to the general population. There are limited data about the incidence of PA in children. Toxic adenoma has been reported in 5%–7.5% of pediatric patients with thyroid nodules (<xref rid=""B27"" ref-type=""bibr"">27</xref>). Children with a hyperfunctioning autonomous nodule may indeed present with either mild or overt hyperthyroidism or sometimes euthyroidism (<xref rid=""B5"" ref-type=""bibr"">5</xref>). There seems to be a correlation between the size of the nodule and the biochemical picture. It has been reported that autonomous nodules less than 2.5 cm in diameter usually show incomplete suppression of the surrounding thyroid parenchyma, resulting in a subclinical hyperthyroidism. On the other hand, complete suppression is usually associated with lesions of 3 cm or more in size (<xref rid=""B7"" ref-type=""bibr"">7</xref>). However, the natural history of this rare condition and the correlation between the biochemical and radiological picture of the (complete or incomplete) suppression of the thyroid parenchyma surrounding the lesion have not been well defined (<xref rid=""B5"" ref-type=""bibr"">5</xref>). The available data on the prevalence and evolution of thyroid diseases in subjects with PWS almost exclusively concern CH and congenital hypothyroidism (<xref rid=""B14"" ref-type=""bibr"">14</xref>, <xref rid=""B19"" ref-type=""bibr"">19</xref>), thus there are insufficient data to hypothesize a peculiar evolution of the thyroid biochemical picture of PA in PWS. The most recent guidelines recommend surgery, lobectomy plus isthmectomy in most cases, as the optimal initial management for children with PA because of concerns about the mutagenic effect of radioiodine on the normal thyroid tissue, supported by the concern that the cancer risk in children with a thyroid nodular disease is higher than in the adult population and up to one-third of patients may have an incidentally discovered cancer associated with autonomous nodules (<xref rid=""B5"" ref-type=""bibr"">5</xref>, <xref rid=""B7"" ref-type=""bibr"">7</xref>). PWS is not considered a cancer predisposition syndrome: a recent retrospective study with a large international cohort of 706 patients confirmed that malignancies are rare in patients with PWS and usually due to a multifactorial etiology (<xref rid=""B28"" ref-type=""bibr"">28</xref>). To date, 50 published reports describe malignancies in individuals with PWS (<xref rid=""B29"" ref-type=""bibr"">29</xref>), including acute lymphoblastic leukemia (<xref rid=""B30"" ref-type=""bibr"">30</xref>), acute and chronic myeloid leukemia (<xref rid=""B31"" ref-type=""bibr"">31</xref>), hepatoblastoma (<xref rid=""B32"" ref-type=""bibr"">32</xref>), medulloblastoma (<xref rid=""B33"" ref-type=""bibr"">33</xref>), pulmonary carcinoid tumor (<xref rid=""B34"" ref-type=""bibr"">34</xref>), Wilms tumor (<xref rid=""B35"" ref-type=""bibr"">35</xref>), multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 (<xref rid=""B36"" ref-type=""bibr"">36</xref>), a case of fetal cardiac rhabdomyoma (<xref rid=""B37"" ref-type=""bibr"">37</xref>), and gonadal germ cell tumors in 22.5% of all cases (11/50) (<xref rid=""B29"" ref-type=""bibr"">29</xref>). Maya-González et al. showed no increased risk of cancer at any age in PWS patients compared with the general population; however, among individuals developing cancer, they highlighted an increased prevalence of tumors at pediatric age in PWS patients compared with the control group (25% vs. 8.7%) (<xref rid=""B29"" ref-type=""bibr"">29</xref>). Moreover, they noticed an increased occurrence of gonadal (testicular or ovarian) tumors in PWS at any age in comparison with the control group (17% vs. 3%), suggesting an increased risk for these neoplasms in PWS (<xref rid=""B29"" ref-type=""bibr"">29</xref>). Furthermore, these authors (<xref rid=""B29"" ref-type=""bibr"">29</xref>) suggested a loss of imprinting (LOI) as a possible mechanism of tumorigenesis in these patients, as documented in their case report (<xref rid=""B29"" ref-type=""bibr"">29</xref>) and in a 13-year-old girl with PWS who also developed bilateral ovarian sex cord tumors with annular tubules (<xref rid=""B38"" ref-type=""bibr"">38</xref>). The role of GH therapy in influencing the risk of cancer in PWS has been debated. GH treatment has shown significant beneficial effects on linear growth, body composition, physical strength, and mental development, with a reassuring safety profile for daily administration in children with PWS (<xref rid=""B39"" ref-type=""bibr"">39</xref>–<xref rid=""B41"" ref-type=""bibr"">41</xref>). Sjöström and Höybye documented that, over a follow-up period of approximately 20 years, GH treatment during childhood or in adulthood with PWS is not associated with an increased risk of cancer (<xref rid=""B42"" ref-type=""bibr"">42</xref>). Hirsch and Gross-Tsur hypothesized that increases in insulin-like factor-1 as a result of GH treatment over the course of several decades in PWS adults raise concern over the possible increase in the risk of cancer (<xref rid=""B43"" ref-type=""bibr"">43</xref>), although there is no evidence to date of a clear correlation between GH therapy and cancer risk in PWS subjects (<xref rid=""B14"" ref-type=""bibr"">14</xref>, <xref rid=""B28"" ref-type=""bibr"">28</xref>). Multiple observational studies carried out in a non-PWS population did not indicate an increased risk of malignancy after treatment with GH during childhood (<xref rid=""B44"" ref-type=""bibr"">44</xref>, <xref rid=""B45"" ref-type=""bibr"">45</xref>). However, it should be considered that the <italic toggle=""yes"">Safety and Appropriateness of Growth Hormone Treatments in Europe</italic> (SAGhE) study showed an increased incidence of cancer related to second primary malignancies in patients who received GH treatment after cancer treatment (<xref rid=""B46"" ref-type=""bibr"">46</xref>). Therefore, GH treatment is considered safe, although some authors suggest that the involvement of additional genetic factors and/or GH treatment in cancer development cannot be excluded (<xref rid=""B28"" ref-type=""bibr"">28</xref>, <xref rid=""B30"" ref-type=""bibr"">30</xref>, <xref rid=""B46"" ref-type=""bibr"">46</xref>). In the few studies available, the malignancy rate of hyperfunctioning nodules at pediatric age ranges from 0% to 29% (<xref rid=""B27"" ref-type=""bibr"">27</xref>): Niedziela et al. reported an incidence of 29% malignancy among 31 children and adolescents with hyperfunctioning nodules detected by 99mTc scintigraphy (<xref rid=""B47"" ref-type=""bibr"">47</xref>). A group in Belo Horizonte, Brazil, reported an incidence of malignancy of 5.9% in a series of 13 patients with 17 hyperfunctioning nodules (<xref rid=""B48"" ref-type=""bibr"">48</xref>). On the other hand, Ly et al. reported no cancer in their single-center experience with 31 children diagnosed with PA, suggesting that conservative management could be offered in childhood, deferring definitive therapies until adulthood (<xref rid=""B49"" ref-type=""bibr"">49</xref>). Gundgurthi et al. reported the case of a 3-year-old boy with PA successfully treated with 131-iodine radio ablation (<xref rid=""B50"" ref-type=""bibr"">50</xref>). Concerning our patient, no noticeable risk factors for cancer, such as obesity, a previous primary malignancy before starting GH treatment, or a suspected genetic predisposition, have been revealed according to the underlying syndrome. Nevertheless, in accordance with the most recent guidelines (<xref rid=""B5"" ref-type=""bibr"">5</xref>, <xref rid=""B7"" ref-type=""bibr"">7</xref>), taking into account case reports of DTC found after the resection of a PA that support hemithyroidectomy as the treatment of choice (<xref rid=""B51"" ref-type=""bibr"">51</xref>–<xref rid=""B53"" ref-type=""bibr"">53</xref>), and considering that our patient with PWS and PA is a male younger than 10 years of age, with an unknown risk of malignancy in nodular disease, we decided to proceed with a hemithyroidectomy. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report describing PA in a patient with PWS. The management of these rare cases should refer to the most recent guidelines in the management of pediatric thyroid pathology, taking into account the patient's characteristics. Further evidence is needed to assess a possible correlation between PWS and PA, the existence of potential risk factors associated with the appearance of these lesions, and the potential risk of malignancy of hyperfunctioning nodules in PWS.",N/A,08 8 2024
Prader–Willi syndrome: guidance for children and transition into adulthood,"Prader–Willi syndrome (PWS) is a rare orphan disease and complex genetic neurodevelopmental disorder, with a birth incidence of approximately 1 in 10,000–30,000. Management of people with PWS requires a multi-disciplinary approach, ideally through a multi-disciplinary team (MDT) clinic with community support. Hypotonia, poor feeding and faltering growth are characteristic features in the neonatal period, followed by hyperphagia and risk of rapid weight gain later in childhood. Children and adolescents (CA) with PWS usually display developmental delay and mild learning disability and can develop endocrinopathies, scoliosis, respiratory difficulties (both central and obstructive sleep apnoea), challenging behaviours, skin picking, and mental health issues, especially into adulthood. This consensus statement is intended to be a reference document for clinicians managing children and adolescents (up to 18 years of age) with PWS. It considers the bio-psycho-social domains of diagnosis, clinical assessment, and management in the paediatric setting as well as during and after transition to adult services. The guidance has been developed from information gathered from peer-reviewed scientific reports and from the expertise of a range of experienced clinicians in the United Kingdom and Ireland involved in the care of patients with PWS.","Prader–Willi syndrome (PWS) is a rare complex genetic disorder arising from the lack of expression of the paternally inherited imprinted genes on chromosome 15q11-q13. The most common causes are paternal deletion (65–70%) and maternal uniparental disomy (25–30%), with rare causes such as imprinting defects and translocations accounting for ~1% (<xref rid=""bib1"" ref-type=""bibr"">1</xref>). The incidence of PWS is reported to be between 1 in 10,000–30,000 (<xref rid=""bib2"" ref-type=""bibr"">2</xref>, <xref rid=""bib3"" ref-type=""bibr"">3</xref>). Phenotypic manifestations vary according to the developmental phase in PWS. Hypotonia, poor feeding and faltering growth are dominant features in the neonatal period and whilst most infants are diagnosed early on, there still remains a delay in diagnosis for some patients (<xref rid=""bib4"" ref-type=""bibr"">4</xref>). Nutritional and growth phases in children and adolescents (CA) with PWS are well described, with weight gain and hyperphagia leading to obesity later on in childhood if access to food is uncontrolled, with premature mortality primarily due to obesity-related complications in adulthood (<xref rid=""bib5"" ref-type=""bibr"">5</xref>, <xref rid=""bib6"" ref-type=""bibr"">6</xref>, <xref rid=""bib7"" ref-type=""bibr"">7</xref>, <xref rid=""bib8"" ref-type=""bibr"">8</xref>). CA affected by PWS can develop endocrinopathies due to hypothalamic dysfunction, such as growth hormone deficiency (GHD), and hypogonadotropic and hypergonadotropic hypogonadism. Central hypothyroidism and central adrenal insufficiency (CAI) are more rare. Other problems include scoliosis, which is related to hypotonia, respiratory difficulties, both central and obstructive sleep apnoea, as well as developmental delay and learning disabilities with temper tantrums, and skin picking (<xref rid=""bib5"" ref-type=""bibr"">5</xref>, <xref rid=""bib9"" ref-type=""bibr"">9</xref>). There is no effective medical treatment for the primary hyperphagia in PWS. Management therefore requires a lifelong multi-disciplinary approach, ideally through a multi-disciplinary team (MDT) clinic, with community support. The purpose of this article is to provide evidence-based expert consensus guidance on the management of CA with PWS. This guidance was developed in accordance with The Appraisal of Guidelines Research and Evaluation Instrument II (AGREE II) criteria (<xref rid=""bib10"" ref-type=""bibr"">10</xref>), and the 2020 RCPCH Standards for Development of Paediatric Guideline (<xref rid=""bib11"" ref-type=""bibr"">11</xref>). A consensus group was devised from clinicians with extensive experience in the management of PWS from the PWS specialist clinics in the United Kingdom and Republic of Ireland. Searches relating to the diagnosis, management and transition of CA with PWS were conducted using a combination of text words and MeSH subject headings via the Ovid MEDLINE and the Cochrane Library. The initial literature search was conducted in March 2020 and repeated in Oct 2023. Papers were excluded from review if they were not written in the English language. The quality of evidence and risk of bias was assessed using the GRADE approach (<xref rid=""bib12"" ref-type=""bibr"">12</xref>). Guideline recommendations agreed by the entire group were made based on the highest level of evidence obtained. Where evidence was lacking or deemed too conflicting or inadequate to be able to make a recommendation, the authors then framed a recommendation.   Children and adults with PWS can experience multiple medical, cognitive, behavioural and emotional issues and problems, some of which are potentially life-limiting. Adults with PWS are unfortunately still dying from hyperphagia and obesity-related complications.

 PWS is a rare orphan disease with no effective pharmacological treatment currently available for hyperphagia. In practice, CA and adults with PWS, their families, and carers have variable access to clinical and coordinated PWS expertise. Families and carers report unmet needs to the PWSA UK and Ireland. Increased knowledge and education about PWS are vital for all health and social care professionals alongside the development of multidisciplinary expert clinical networks and commissioning. Greater availability and easier access are needed for adult specialist PWS residential services providing food security, meaningful activities, and meaningful activities and well informed support. Increased funding is required for specialist clinical and residential services and for the national PWS associations, which provide vital support, advice, and training. There have been considerable advances in the understanding and management of PWS over the last 20 years, and the future of young people is potentially different from many previous reports. With improved management, the clinical phenotype has also changed, with reduced obesity and fewer resultant co-morbidities. However, for optimal progress, their requirements include access to expert clinical knowledge and coordinated multidisciplinary health and social care, together with family support, and these are not yet guaranteed. This paper provides guidance and background information on the multidisciplinary care of children and young adults with PWS in the UK and Ireland. It focuses on best practices for children and the transition to adulthood. It is based on available evidence and expert opinion.

Methods of Determining Energy Expenditure in Individuals with Prader-Willi Syndrome: A Systematic Literature Review,"Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) is a rare disorder characterised by varying nutritional phases that occur throughout the lifespan, ranging from failure to thrive to hyperphagia. If uncontrolled, the imbalance between energy intake and expenditure results in obesity development and increased morbidity and mortality risk. Although measures of energy requirements for accurate nutrition assessment are vital, the evidence appears sparse and heterogeneous; hence, the aim of this review was to examine the available literature on energy expenditure predicted or measured using various methods in individuals with PWS. Studies were sought that presented methods and results on resting energy expenditure or basal metabolic rate. A narrative synthesis was completed to present the study characteristics and results. Methods of determining energy requirements included predictive equations and indirect calorimetry. Differences amongst ages, growth hormone therapy, fasting status, and measures in which results were presented were limitations to appropriately summarising and identifying trends in energy expenditure. Indirect calorimetry was identified as the most accurate method; however, it is not widely available in all settings. Further research is encouraged to support the development of valid and reliable predictive equations that will better inform and improve the efficiency of clinical practice in supporting people with PWS.","Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) is a rare genetic disorder with an incidence of 1 in 15,000–30,000 [<xref rid=""B1-nutrients-16-02161"" ref-type=""bibr"">1</xref>], originating from a defective paternal chromosome, 15q11.2-q13 [<xref rid=""B2-nutrients-16-02161"" ref-type=""bibr"">2</xref>]. It is characterised by hypotonia, developmental and cognitive delays, behavioural problems, sleep disorders, and neuroendocrine abnormalities [<xref rid=""B3-nutrients-16-02161"" ref-type=""bibr"">3</xref>]. Alongside this, different nutritional phases also occur throughout the lifespan of individuals with PWS [<xref rid=""B4-nutrients-16-02161"" ref-type=""bibr"">4</xref>]. Children with PWS present with hypotonia and weak sucking during early infancy, often resulting in nutritional deficiencies and failure to thrive. Appetite and feeding improvements occur later in infancy (9–24 months), where growth and weight gain then return to normal rates [<xref rid=""B4-nutrients-16-02161"" ref-type=""bibr"">4</xref>]. Couto-Rosende et al. (2023) [<xref rid=""B4-nutrients-16-02161"" ref-type=""bibr"">4</xref>] describe how, from two years of age, children with PWS begin to gradually develop an increased interest in food, which is associated with weight gain that continues throughout childhood. Hyperphagia and a lack of satiety then develop, which, if left uncontrolled, result in a chronic energy imbalance between energy intake and energy expenditure and are linked with the development of early childhood obesity [<xref rid=""B1-nutrients-16-02161"" ref-type=""bibr"">1</xref>]. Without preventative interventions, individuals with PWS are at greater risk of increased morbidity and mortality, since obesity development is highlighted as the most important health problem in this population [<xref rid=""B4-nutrients-16-02161"" ref-type=""bibr"">4</xref>]. The obesity associated with PWS differs from common obesity, where less lean body mass (LBM) and higher body fat (BF) are seen in those with PWS when compared with non-syndromic individuals matched for BMI [<xref rid=""B4-nutrients-16-02161"" ref-type=""bibr"">4</xref>]. Most individuals with PWS have growth hormone deficiency (GHD), which is associated with decreased LBM, increased fat mass (FM), hypotonia, low resting energy expenditure (REE), and decreased movement [<xref rid=""B4-nutrients-16-02161"" ref-type=""bibr"">4</xref>]. Further to this, total energy expenditure (TEE) is also lower because of additional factors, including decreased physical activity levels and lower energy utilisation related to reduced fat-free mass (FFM) [<xref rid=""B1-nutrients-16-02161"" ref-type=""bibr"">1</xref>,<xref rid=""B4-nutrients-16-02161"" ref-type=""bibr"">4</xref>]. Preventing obesity in individuals with PWS requires a combination of dietetic, physical, psychological, and behavioural interventions [<xref rid=""B4-nutrients-16-02161"" ref-type=""bibr"">4</xref>]. Current recommendations for nutrition intervention include restricting intake of energy (kJ or kcal) to prevent an energy imbalance, with varying values suggested ranging from 6 to 7 kcal (not specific to children or adults) [<xref rid=""B3-nutrients-16-02161"" ref-type=""bibr"">3</xref>] to 8–11 kcal for children per centimetre of height [<xref rid=""B4-nutrients-16-02161"" ref-type=""bibr"">4</xref>]. Other relevant recommendations suggest that the intake of children should be limited from 60% [<xref rid=""B5-nutrients-16-02161"" ref-type=""bibr"">5</xref>] to 60–80% [<xref rid=""B4-nutrients-16-02161"" ref-type=""bibr"">4</xref>] of the caloric total of a normal diet for a non-syndromic individual matched for height and age, with another recommendation of 60–75% intake, however not specific to children or adults [<xref rid=""B6-nutrients-16-02161"" ref-type=""bibr"">6</xref>]. In contrast, a study investigating the energy needs of children with PWS that underwent GHT found that children with PWS only required 3.2% fewer calories than healthy children to maintain growth [<xref rid=""B4-nutrients-16-02161"" ref-type=""bibr"">4</xref>]. In order to complete nutrition assessments and determine the effectiveness of interventions implemented for individuals with PWS, it is necessary to conduct accurate assessments of energy requirements [<xref rid=""B1-nutrients-16-02161"" ref-type=""bibr"">1</xref>]. Lazzer et al. (2016) have stated that basal metabolic rate (BMR) accounts for 70–80% of daily expenditure for PWS patients and therefore provides a basis for determining energy requirements. BMR is defined as the minimal energy required to maintain vital functions, while REE is defined as the energy required at rest [<xref rid=""B7-nutrients-16-02161"" ref-type=""bibr"">7</xref>], with the other components of energy expenditure presented in <xref rid=""nutrients-16-02161-f001"" ref-type=""fig"">Figure 1</xref>. The most accurate method of measuring or determining BMR is indirect calorimetry; however, this can be both costly and impractical in most settings; hence, predictive equations are the second-best practical alternative developed and used to predict energy requirements [<xref rid=""B1-nutrients-16-02161"" ref-type=""bibr"">1</xref>]. The protocol for this systematic literature review was published on PROSPERO on 30 December 2023 (registration number: CRD42023494703). This review was drafted according to the guidelines of the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) statement [<xref rid=""B9-nutrients-16-02161"" ref-type=""bibr"">9</xref>].  The age range of study participants in the selected studies (<xref rid=""nutrients-16-02161-f003"" ref-type=""fig"">Figure 3</xref>) demonstrates a wide and even spread across the lifespan, ranging from infancy to mid-adulthood. This has allowed results to be presented and interpreted as an overview of the lifespan, while also exploring and highlighting any potential differences and comparisons that could be made between ages. The 25 studies included in this review all predicted or measured resting or basal energy expenditure in individuals with PWS. The characteristics of the populations varied in age, gender, and location, with further contrasts in fasting status, testing methods, and even potential comorbidities. The countries that the studies were conducted in included the USA, Canada, the United Kingdom, Spain, France, the Netherlands, and Italy, all of which are considered high-income countries [<xref rid=""B35-nutrients-16-02161"" ref-type=""bibr"">35</xref>]. This may be due to the reported disparities in scientific capacity between countries based on health researchers (in full-time equivalent) per million inhabitants by income group in different countries [<xref rid=""B36-nutrients-16-02161"" ref-type=""bibr"">36</xref>]. This will be later discussed alongside the accessibility and feasibility of equipment and the expertise of indirect calorimetry. Approximately one-third of the studies included in this analysis were randomised controlled studies, which provide the highest level of evidence after systematic literature reviews, while the remainder fall under quasi-experimental and observational studies, which represent the next two levels of evidence [<xref rid=""B37-nutrients-16-02161"" ref-type=""bibr"">37</xref>]. The combination of these study designs provides overall strength and quality to the evidence in the current systematic literature review. The various methods of measuring EE components, BMR and REE, have been clearly identified among the studies in this review. Although there are ranging results dependent on several factors such as age, sex, and method of measurement used, this heterogeneity between included studies resulted in difficulty appropriately summarising and identifying trends in EE due to various limitations. IC was the singular method used that took into consideration the altered body composition of individuals with PWS; therefore, is identified as the most accurate and necessary method for this population. However, as IC is not widely available in all settings where individuals with PWS are monitored, further research is encouraged to support the development of practical, accurate, and cost-effective predictive equations of EE that will better inform and improve the efficiency of clinical practice.",N/A,07 7 2024
Mechanism of EHMT2-mediated genomic imprinting associated with Prader-Willi syndrome,"Prader-Willi Syndrome (PWS) is caused by loss of expression of paternally expressed genes in the human 15q11.2-q13 imprinting domain. A set of imprinted genes that are active on the paternal but silenced on the maternal chromosome are intricately regulated by a bipartite imprinting center (PWS-IC) located in the PWS imprinting domain. In past work, we discovered that euchromatic histone lysine N-methyltransferase-2 (EHMT2/G9a) inhibitors were capable of un-silencing PWS-associated genes by restoring their expression from the maternal chromosome. Here, in mice lacking the <italic toggle=""yes"">Ehmt2</italic> gene, we document un-silencing of the imprinted <italic toggle=""yes"">Snrpn/Snhg14</italic> gene on the maternal chromosome in the late embryonic and postnatal brain. Using PWS and Angelman syndrome patient derived cells with either paternal or maternal deletion of 15q11-q13, we have found that chromatin of maternal PWS-IC is closed and has compact 3D folding confirmation. We further show that a new and distinct noncoding RNA preferentially transcribed from upstream of the PWS-IC interacts with EHMT2 and forms a heterochromatin complex to silence gene expression of <italic toggle=""yes"">SNRPN</italic> in CIS on maternal chromosome. Taken together, these findings demonstrate that allele-specific recruitment of EHMT2 is required to maintain the maternal imprints. Our findings provide novel mechanistic insights and support a new model for imprinting maintenance of the PWS imprinted domain.","Imprinted genes, unique to mammals and flowering plants, are regulated such that they are expressed from either the maternal or paternal allele but not both<sup><xref rid=""R1"" ref-type=""bibr"">1</xref>,<xref rid=""R2"" ref-type=""bibr"">2</xref></sup>. Frequently clustered in the same chromosomal domain, imprinted genes are coordinately controlled by an imprinting center (IC) or control region (ICR). Since the discovery of genomic imprinting<sup><xref rid=""R3"" ref-type=""bibr"">3</xref>,<xref rid=""R4"" ref-type=""bibr"">4</xref></sup>, investigations have focused on two fundamental questions: how cells recognize the paternal and maternal alleles and how cells maintain allele-specific repression of imprinted genes. The imprinting domain of chromosome 15q11.2-q13, implicated in the pathogenesis of both Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) and Angelman syndrome (AS), has long been an established model for investigating genomic imprinting<sup><xref rid=""R5"" ref-type=""bibr"">5</xref>–<xref rid=""R7"" ref-type=""bibr"">7</xref></sup>. The 15q11-q13 imprinting domain contains a PWS imprinting center (PWS-IC) and a AS-imprinting center (AS-IC) and two functionally distinct and oppositely imprinted regions<sup><xref rid=""R8"" ref-type=""bibr"">8</xref>–<xref rid=""R10"" ref-type=""bibr"">10</xref></sup>. Paternally expressed genes <italic toggle=""yes"">SNURF/SNRPN</italic>, <italic toggle=""yes"">SNORD116, SNORD115,</italic> and <italic toggle=""yes"">SNHG14</italic> are located within a 0.5Mb region distal to the PWS-IC and paternally expressed genes <italic toggle=""yes"">NDN</italic>, <italic toggle=""yes"">MAGLE2</italic>, and <italic toggle=""yes"">MKRN3</italic> are ~1.5 Mb proximal to the PWS-IC. However, how the PWS-IC controls allele specific expression bidirectionally remains poorly understood. The genomic organization of the 15q11.2-q13 imprinting domain is highly conserved in the chromosome 7C region in mice<sup><xref rid=""R11"" ref-type=""bibr"">11</xref></sup> and the general imprinting regulation mechanism is highly similar in humans and rodents. However, at a sequence level, specific regulatory elements are not highly conserved, presenting challenges for mechanistic analyses in animal models. At a structural level, the critical region of PWS-IC has been mapped to a 4.1 kb region that includes the CpG island (CGI) encompassing exon 1 of <italic toggle=""yes"">SNRPN</italic><sup><xref rid=""R8"" ref-type=""bibr"">8</xref>,<xref rid=""R9"" ref-type=""bibr"">9</xref>,<xref rid=""R12"" ref-type=""bibr"">12</xref></sup>. PWS-IC is methylated (5mC) on the maternal chromosome in oocytes but unmethylated on the paternal chromosome in sperm<sup><xref rid=""R13"" ref-type=""bibr"">13</xref></sup>. Thus, after fertilization, the maternal methylation signature provides an allele-specific methylation imprint that becomes resistant to epigenetic reprogramming<sup><xref rid=""R14"" ref-type=""bibr"">14</xref></sup>. Although the maternal methylation signatures correlate with repressed expression of paternally expressed genes on the maternal chromosome, exactly how the methylated PWS-IC silences these genes has remained elusive. The PWS-IC on the paternal chromosome regulates the expression of paternally expressed genes<sup><xref rid=""R8"" ref-type=""bibr"">8</xref>,<xref rid=""R15"" ref-type=""bibr"">15</xref></sup>, and when deleted from the paternal chromosome in germ cells in both human and mice, the unmethylated pattern of the paternal chromosome became methylated pattern that resemble of maternal chromosome and the paternal gene expression is lost in offspring<sup><xref rid=""R15"" ref-type=""bibr"">15</xref>–<xref rid=""R18"" ref-type=""bibr"">18</xref></sup>. In contrast, the role of PWS-IC on the maternal chromosome and the mechanism underlying silenced expression in the maternal chromosome are unknown. In mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs) and embryos null for the DNA methyltransferase <italic toggle=""yes"">Dnmt1</italic>, methylation of CGI in the PWS-IC on the maternal chromosome was lost<sup><xref rid=""R19"" ref-type=""bibr"">19</xref>,<xref rid=""R20"" ref-type=""bibr"">20</xref></sup>. Although transcription of the paternally expressed <italic toggle=""yes"">Snrpn</italic> gene on the maternal chromosome remained repressed in <italic toggle=""yes"">Dnmt1</italic>-null ES cells<sup><xref rid=""R19"" ref-type=""bibr"">19</xref></sup>, <italic toggle=""yes"">Snrpn</italic> gene expression was unsilenced in <italic toggle=""yes"">Dnmt1</italic>-null embryos<sup><xref rid=""R20"" ref-type=""bibr"">20</xref></sup>. Similarly, treatment with DNA methylation inhibitors in PWS patient-derived cells with a paternal 15q11.2-q13 deletion reduced CGI DNA methylation (5mC) and unsilenced <italic toggle=""yes"">SNRPN</italic> expression from the maternal chromosome<sup><xref rid=""R21"" ref-type=""bibr"">21</xref>,<xref rid=""R22"" ref-type=""bibr"">22</xref></sup>. In our large-scale small molecule screen in <italic toggle=""yes"">Snrpn-EGFP</italic> mouse embryonic fibroblasts, we discovered that inhibitors of the nuclear histone lysine methyltransferase EHMT2, also known as G9a, were capable of unsilencing the imprinted <italic toggle=""yes"">SNRPN</italic> and <italic toggle=""yes"">SNHG14</italic> genes from the maternal chromosome, both in human fibroblasts derived from patients with PWS and in a PWS mouse model<sup><xref rid=""R21"" ref-type=""bibr"">21</xref></sup>. Unexpectedly, EHMT2 inhibitors unsilenced the repressed expression but did not change the DNA methylation of PWS-IC<sup><xref rid=""R21"" ref-type=""bibr"">21</xref></sup>. EHMT2 catalyzes mono- and di-methylation of histone H3 lysine 9 (H3K9) or other non-histone proteins<sup><xref rid=""R23"" ref-type=""bibr"">23</xref></sup>. H3K9me2 is a repressive mark for epigenetic transcriptional silencing leading to heterochromatin assembly with chromodomain-containing proteins of the HP 1 family<sup><xref rid=""R23"" ref-type=""bibr"">23</xref>–<xref rid=""R26"" ref-type=""bibr"">26</xref></sup>. EHMT2 plays a significant role to maintain imprinted DNA methylation, including at the PWS-IC, in embryonic stem cells; this activity is independent from its catalytic activity responsible for H3K9 methylation<sup><xref rid=""R27"" ref-type=""bibr"">27</xref></sup>. Recent chromatin structure studies support an important role for EHMT2-mediated H3K9 in the 3D genome organization of chromatin<sup><xref rid=""R28"" ref-type=""bibr"">28</xref></sup>. Consistently, chromatin loops and topological associated domains (TADs) undergo alterations in EHMT2-deficient mouse ESCs or EHMT2 inhibitor-treated hepatocytes, resulting in de-repression of a subset of nuclear envelope-bound genes<sup><xref rid=""R29"" ref-type=""bibr"">29</xref>–<xref rid=""R31"" ref-type=""bibr"">31</xref></sup>. Here, we set out to decipher how EHMT2 inhibition instructs unsilencing of PWS imprinted genes. We found that <italic toggle=""yes"">Ehmt2</italic> deficiency in mouse forebrain is sufficient to unsilence the expression of imprinted <italic toggle=""yes"">Snrpn</italic> on the maternal chromosome, without any reduction in DNA methylation of PWS-IC. In human PWS and AS patient derived fibroblasts with paternal or maternal deletion of 15q11.2-q13 respectively, we found that EHMT2 preferentially binds to maternal PWS-IC and enriches H3K9me2, independent of the allele-specific DNA methylation status at the PWS-IC, and that chromatin of the maternal PWS imprinting domain is in a closed and compact 3D folding confirmation. We further show that maternal noncoding RNA transcribed upstream of the PWS-IC interacts with EHMT2 and forms a heterochromatin complex to silence gene expression of <italic toggle=""yes"">SNRPN</italic> in CIS on maternal chromosome. These fundamental findings support that EHMT2 plays a central role of maintaining the silenced expression of paternally expressed genes in the maternal chromosome.  Here, we deploy comprehensive molecular and high resolution chromatin analyses using PWS and AS patient-derived fibroblast with paternal or maternal deletion respectively to significantly advance our understanding of mechanisms underlying imprinting regulation in 15q11.2-q13 region. Firstly, we show that EHMT2-mediated H3K9me2 but not DNA methylation on the maternal PWS-IC is essential for maintaining the silencing of paternally expressed genes in the maternal chromosome. Secondly, distinct mechanisms operate to silence the expression of paternally expressed genes proximal and distal to the bipartite PWS-IC in the maternal chromosome. It is known that the microdeletion of PWS-IC on the paternal chromosome result in loss of the expression of paternally expressed genes of both distal and proximal sites both in human and mice<sup><xref rid=""R15"" ref-type=""bibr"">15</xref>–<xref rid=""R18"" ref-type=""bibr"">18</xref></sup>. In contrast, the deletion of PWS-IC in the maternal chromosome does not alter the expression of the paternally expressed genes in the maternal chromosome. These results indicate that the DNA regulatory element of PWS-IC in the maternal chromosome is not directly implicated in silencing of imprinted genes in the maternal chromosome. A prevailing hypothesis is that maternal allele-specific DNA methylation in the PWS-IC silences expression of paternally expressed genes on the maternal chromosome<sup><xref rid=""R8"" ref-type=""bibr"">8</xref></sup>. However, supporting evidence for this hypothesis has been inconsistent. Loss of methylation of PWS-IC is observed in both mouse <italic toggle=""yes"">Dnmt1</italic><sup>−/−</sup> ESC and embryos. However, expression of <italic toggle=""yes"">Snrpn</italic> is mono-allelic in ESC but biallelic in embryos of <italic toggle=""yes"">Dnmt1</italic><sup>−/−20,<xref rid=""R49"" ref-type=""bibr"">49</xref></sup>. In contrast, expression of <italic toggle=""yes"">Snrpn</italic> is biallelic in <italic toggle=""yes"">Ehmt2</italic><sup>−/−</sup> ESC and embryos<sup><xref rid=""R19"" ref-type=""bibr"">19</xref>,<xref rid=""R27"" ref-type=""bibr"">27</xref></sup>. Interestingly, methylation of PWS-IC in the maternal chromosome is lost in ESC but intact in embryos of <italic toggle=""yes"">Ehmt2</italic><sup>−/−19</sup>. These results indicate both DNMT1 and EHMT2 contribute to the methylation of PWS-IC in ESC but only DNMT1 is involved in the embryo. These are consistent with other reports that DNMT1 and EHMT2 interact directly<sup><xref rid=""R51"" ref-type=""bibr"">51</xref>,<xref rid=""R52"" ref-type=""bibr"">52</xref></sup>. This is also in line with the finding that different epigenetic machinery proteins are implicated in the epigenomic reprograming of demethylation during early development<sup><xref rid=""R53"" ref-type=""bibr"">53</xref></sup>. Consistent with these findings, we reported that EHMT2 inhibitors unsilence the paternally expressed <italic toggle=""yes"">SNRPN/SNHG14</italic> from the imprinted genes on maternal chromosome without changing the DNA methylation of PWS-IC<sup><xref rid=""R21"" ref-type=""bibr"">21</xref></sup>. Here, we showed that conditional inactivation of <italic toggle=""yes"">Ehmt2</italic> in the embryonic mouse brain reduces H3K9me2 levels without any changes in DNA methylation of the PWS-IC and unsilenced the expression of maternally imprinted <italic toggle=""yes"">Snprn</italic>. Unexpectedly, expression of the paternally imprinted genes <italic toggle=""yes"">Magel2</italic>, <italic toggle=""yes"">Ndn</italic>, and <italic toggle=""yes"">Mkrn3</italic> proximal to the centromere was not affected. These findings support that EHMT2 and H3K9me2 play a critical role in maintaining the silenced expression of PWS associated genes proximal to PWS-IC in the maternal allele. Surprisingly, our findings indicate that a distinct mechanism controls the silenced expression of paternally expressed genes in the distal side of PWS in the maternal chromosome. Unique to this study, we were able to determine allelic specific chromatin accessibility, looping, and 3D chromatin folding of PWS imprinting domain because we employed the high-resolution epigenome and chromatin profiling technologies in human PWS and AS cell models with a paternal or maternal deletion respectively. The paternal allele is associated with a more open chromatin state and more chromatin loops while the maternal allele represents a more closed chromatin state and less loops. Notably, there is a scarcity of CTCF binding in the imprinted domain of 15q11.2-q13 compared to the 11p15.5 imprinted region associated with imprinted genes of <italic toggle=""yes"">H19</italic> and <italic toggle=""yes"">IGF2</italic><sup><xref rid=""R42"" ref-type=""bibr"">42</xref></sup>. Through application of the newly developed high resolution chromatin tracing method, we were able to uncover an allele-specific 3D-folding organization of the PWS critical region with the 50kb genomic resolution. We found that EHMT2 and H3K9me2 were enriched in the maternal PWS-IC. This enrichment was not affected upon inhibition of DNA methylation, suggesting that maternal DNA methylation is not required to maintain EHMT2 binding to the PWS-IC or instruct allele-specific EHMT2 binding. The transcript structures upstream and downstream of coding <italic toggle=""yes"">SNRPN</italic> exons are complex and have not been fully delineated. The tissue and transcript specific imprinted and non-imprinted expression pattern for these non-coding RNAs has been described<sup><xref rid=""R54"" ref-type=""bibr"">54</xref>,<xref rid=""R55"" ref-type=""bibr"">55</xref></sup>. Interestingly, we discovered that a new noncoding RNA (280118) associated with TSS4 is preferentially expressed from the maternal chromosome. The TSS4 and 280118 are distinct from the oocyte-specific u1A (TSS3) and u1B (TSS5) previously reported<sup><xref rid=""R45"" ref-type=""bibr"">45</xref></sup>. The exons of 280118 do not overlap with other adjacent transcripts that are predominately paternal or biallelic. These data suggest that 280118 transcript represent a distinct ncRNA and has a distinct function. Our RNA immunoprecipitation analysis supports that ncRNA 280118 that is preferentially expressed from the maternal chromosome plays a role in EHMT2 recruitment in CIS to the maternal PWS-IC. EMHT2 forms a local repressor or heterochromatin chromatin complex with SUV39H1 and HP1α and silences the expression of <italic toggle=""yes"">SNRPN/SNHG14</italic> on the maternal chromosome. It is noted that a similar mechanism has been described for the maternally expressed <italic toggle=""yes"">Igf2r</italic> gene: the paternally expressed antisense noncoding <italic toggle=""yes"">Air</italic> RNA mediates silencing of <italic toggle=""yes"">Ig2r</italic> expression in cis by recruiting EHMT2 to chromatin<sup><xref rid=""R25"" ref-type=""bibr"">25</xref>,<xref rid=""R56"" ref-type=""bibr"">56</xref>,<xref rid=""R57"" ref-type=""bibr"">57</xref></sup>. DNA elements within its locus are not required for <italic toggle=""yes"">Air</italic> RNA to silence distant imprinted genes. The same is observed for PWS-IC: deletion of PWS-IC DNA in the maternal chromosome does not affect the imprinted expression of paternally expressed genes<sup><xref rid=""R18"" ref-type=""bibr"">18</xref></sup>. Our analysis did not reveal that EHMT2 inhibitor significantly enhances chromatin accessibility or changes the chromatin folding organization of the PWS imprinting domain using a global profiling method of ATAC-seq and targeted chromatin tracing method with 50kb genomic resolution. This is in contrast to the increased chromatin accessibility detected in a previous study using quantitative PCR of genomic DNA following in situ nuclease digestion<sup><xref rid=""R21"" ref-type=""bibr"">21</xref></sup>. It is possible that a change in chromatin accessibility after EHMT2 inhibitor treatment is at a micro-scale and can only be detected by epigenetic profiling methods with higher resolution. On the other hand, we discovered that EHMT2 inhibitor treatment in human fibroblasts significantly reduced the binding of maternal non-coding RNAs and EHMT2. The conformational change in EHMT2 is expected to lead to less formation of heterochromatin complex of EHMT2 with HP1α and SUV39H1 in the PWS-IC and unsilenced the expression of <italic toggle=""yes"">SNPRN</italic> from the maternal chromosome. In summary, our study provides evidence supporting a new model of the mechanism of regulation of the PWS imprinted domain (<xref rid=""F6"" ref-type=""fig"">Fig. 6h</xref>). The new model highlights the key discoveries from this study as well as incorporates exiting knowledge in the literature. First, the DNA methylation of PWS-IC serves in the establishment of imprinting but is not essential for imprinting maintenance. Second, our findings indicate a different mechanism operates to silence expression of paternally expressed genes distal or proximal to the PWS-IC on the maternal chromosome. This is in contrast with reports that PWS-IC likely employs the same mechanism to control the active expression of paternally expressed genes on the paternal chromosome at both distal and proximal sites. Third, we show for the first time that maternal non-coding RNAs upstream of PWS-IC interact with and recruit EHMT2 to PWS-IC, form a heterochromatin repressor complex, and silence the expression of <italic toggle=""yes"">SNRPN/SNHG14</italic> on the maternal chromosome. Thus, EMHT2 at PWS-IC plays a critical role in silencing expression on the maternal chromosome. Our findings have significantly advanced understanding of one of the most investigated imprinting domains to date.  ",N/A,03 7 2024
Should we routinely assess hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal axis in pediatric patients with Prader–Willi syndrome?,,"Prader–Willi syndrome (PWS) is a recognizable pattern of physical impairment with significant cognitive, neurological, endocrine, and behavioral abnormalities caused by a lack of gene expression from the impaired region inherited from the father of chromosome 15q11-q13, near the centromere (<xref rid=""B1"" ref-type=""bibr"">1</xref>). Patients with PWS develop hypothalamic dysfunction that can lead to various endocrine disorders (<xref rid=""B2"" ref-type=""bibr"">2</xref>). Besides the well-known endocrine abnormalities such as GH deficiency, hypogonadism, or pathological obesity, some studies over the last 15 years revealed the possibility of central adrenal insufficiency (CAI), the prevalence of which has been variously described in pediatric patients with PWS. These clinical observations were inspired by a study from 2008 by de Lind van Wijngaarden et al., which found that 60% of patients with PWS present CAI diagnosed on the basis of the test with metyrapone (<xref rid=""B3"" ref-type=""bibr"">3</xref>). Subsequent studies in 2010 showed a significantly lower prevalence of CAI (4%) based on the ACTH test and the insulin test (<xref rid=""B4"" ref-type=""bibr"">4</xref>) or did not confirm the presence of CAI in pediatric patients with PWS based on the ACTH test (<xref rid=""B5"" ref-type=""bibr"">5</xref>). Further studies also did not confirm such a high prevalence of CAI in patients with PWS (<xref rid=""B6"" ref-type=""bibr"">6</xref>–<xref rid=""B8"" ref-type=""bibr"">8</xref>). In the study by Corrias et al., CAI was confirmed in 14.3% of patients with PWS based on the low-dose ACTH test (LDAT) and in 4.8% of patients with PWS based on the standard-dose ACTH test (SDAT) (<xref rid=""B6"" ref-type=""bibr"">6</xref>). The latest studies in pediatric populations excluded CAI in patients with PWS based on the test with insulin (<xref rid=""B7"" ref-type=""bibr"">7</xref>) and based on the test with metyrapone, but not LDAT (<xref rid=""B8"" ref-type=""bibr"">8</xref>). Thus, the question “can CAI be part of the PWS phenotype in children?” still remains unanswered. In addition, it is hypothesized that the risk of CAI may increase during rhGH treatment and may be a potential cause of sudden death in patients with PWS. GH inhibits 11β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 1 (11β-HSD1), resulting in decreased conversion of cortisone to active cortisol. Therefore, it was postulated that patients with PWS treated with rhGH should be monitored for the possibility of an episode of adrenal insufficiency (<xref rid=""B2"" ref-type=""bibr"">2</xref>). The next question that needs to be answered is: Should the hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal axis (HPAA) be routinely evaluated in all patients with PWS treated with rhGH? There is also no agreement on the prevalence of CAI in adults with PWS (<xref rid=""B9"" ref-type=""bibr"">9</xref>, <xref rid=""B10"" ref-type=""bibr"">10</xref>). In some countries, it has been common practice to prescribe stress-dose hydrocortisone during physical or psychological stress in patients with PWS (<xref rid=""B6"" ref-type=""bibr"">6</xref>, <xref rid=""B11"" ref-type=""bibr"">11</xref>). The side effects of frequent use of hydrocortisone include weight gain, osteoporosis, diabetes, and hypertension—already serious problems in adults with PWS. However, inadequate treatment of CAI can cause significant morbidity and even mortality. The most recent data from 2020 indicate that CAI is rare (1.2%) in adults with PWS (<xref rid=""B12"" ref-type=""bibr"">12</xref>). Based on multicenter data obtained from 82 patients, the authors advise against routine prescribing stress doses of hydrocortisone in adults with PWS. Therefore, it is time to ask again, what are the accurate and true data on CAI in children with PWS? To prevent both over- and undertreatment with hydrocortisone in children with PWS, we evaluated adrenal response in LDAT and/or GST in a large multicenter cohort of pediatric patients with PWS. The aim of the study was to assess HPAA in patients with PWS (1) to obtain information about the prevalence of CAI in patients with PWS (2), to compare the results of HPAA diagnostic tests (3), to compare the results obtained in patients with PWS treated and untreated with rhGH, and (4) to analyze the results with the currently available literature in order to propose common recommendations for the assessment of HPAA in patients with PWS.  We conducted a total of 58 tests: 45 LDATs and 13 GSTs. Both tests were performed on 11 patients. We did not observe any serious side effects from either test. Three GSTs were not diagnostic (no hypoglycemia was achieved). Two patients had LDATs twice, due to repeated low cortisol levels in the morning without a clinical CAI picture. LDAT results suggested CAI in four patients, but in two out of four patients, CAI was excluded at GST. GST suggested CAI in only one patient, but was excluded in LDAT. Therefore, CAI was diagnosed in 2/46 patients (4.3%), 1 treated and 1 untreated with rhGH, with the highest cortisol values of 162 and 175 ng/dL, but only on the basis of one test. However, in one of them, the cortisol delta response was >90 ng/mL and more than tripled from baseline. Finally, CAI was diagnosed in one PWS patient treated with rhGH (2.2%), but only on the basis of LDAT. The results of the diagnostic tests are presented in <xref rid=""T2"" ref-type=""table"">
<bold>Table 2</bold>
</xref>. Morning/basal cortisol levels were within the normal range in all patients with PWS not treated with rhGH. Low morning/basal cortisol levels were observed in 4 of the 34 patients treated with rhGH (12%); however, in all of these cases, CAI was excluded by dynamic testing. In contrast, the only CAI patient diagnosed only by LDAT had normal morning cortisol. All patients, both treated and untreated with rhGH, had normal morning ACTH levels. None of our patients developed signs and symptoms of adrenal insufficiency, and none of them were treated with hydrocortisone on a permanent basis. In our only patient with CAI, we recommend treatment in a stressful situation, and we plan to perform another HPAA assessment test. We found no differences in morning ACTH and cortisol values, peak cortisol and cortisol delta between LDAT and GST, and between patients with PWS treated and untreated with rhGH. The results of our study confirmed a very low prevalence of CAI in patients with PWS, consistent with most previous references (<xref rid=""T3"" ref-type=""table"">
<bold>Table 3</bold>
</xref>). Data reports previously from different clinical centers differed even when the same diagnostic tests were used to assess HPAA. The key issue seems to be the correct diagnosis of CAI in this group of patients. It is well known that CAI cannot be determined in patients with PWS by measuring cortisol levels under stressful conditions such as high fever, as patients with PWS may not present with fever during severe infection due to hypothalamic disorders. Therefore, a stimulation test may be the best way to detect adrenal insufficiency. There are several tests used for CAI detection: LDAT, metyrapone test, insulin-induced hypoglycemia test (IIHT), glucagon stimulation test (GST), and corticotrophin hormone (CRH) stimulation test (<xref rid=""B13"" ref-type=""bibr"">13</xref>, <xref rid=""B14"" ref-type=""bibr"">14</xref>). Which test is the best? The IIHT is the gold standard for evaluating the presence of CAI, but it can be dangerous especially in patients with PWS due to the possibility of decreased count regulation hormone response. Metyrapone testing can induce an acute adrenal crisis in patients with a chronic glucocorticoid deficiency and induces sensations such as nausea, vomiting, and hypotension—symptoms of cortisol deficiency also in healthy individuals. The results of the CRH stimulation test, which evaluates the ability of the pituitary gland to secrete ACTH to stimulate cortisol production, are difficult to interpret. There are conflicting reports regarding the cutoff points for this test, and furthermore, the availability of CRH is problematic in some countries. LDAT has high sensitivity in the diagnosis of adrenal dysfunction, but may miss benign CAI (<xref rid=""B15"" ref-type=""bibr"">15</xref>, <xref rid=""B16"" ref-type=""bibr"">16</xref>). The GST has the same sensitivity as LDAT for diagnosing CAI, but may pick up more subtle abnormalities of the HPAA. It is considered an equal and safe alternative to the IIHT and produces similar cortisol responses. An obtained hypoglycemia in both tests is a fast and potent stimulus of CRH secretion, which will, in turn, enhance ACTH secretion and thereafter cortisol production. Thus, a normal response to hypoglycemia requires integrity of the entire HPAA (<xref rid=""B14"" ref-type=""bibr"">14</xref>). The highest incidence of CAI was reported by the Dutch team in 2018 (<xref rid=""B3"" ref-type=""bibr"">3</xref>). The authors performed only one test with metyrapone in the diagnosis of CAI. All of their patients underwent this examination during an overnight stay in the Pediatric Intensive Care Unit. Further studies have shown a significantly lower incidence of CAI or even its absence in patients with PWS (<xref rid=""B4"" ref-type=""bibr"">4</xref>–<xref rid=""B8"" ref-type=""bibr"">8</xref>). Recent data indicate that CAI is not a crucial clinical problem in PWS, but these patients do have a delayed HPAA response during acute stress (<xref rid=""B7"" ref-type=""bibr"">7</xref>). In the study by Oto et al., basal and peak cortisol levels were within the normal range, but the peak cortisol response to ITT was delayed in the majority of patients with PWS (64%) (<xref rid=""B7"" ref-type=""bibr"">7</xref>). Although the mechanism remains unclear, this delay may indicate the existence of a central obstacle to HPAA adjustment. This delayed HPAA response during acute stress has also been reported in a recent study by Grootjen et al. (<xref rid=""B19"" ref-type=""bibr"">19</xref>). Perhaps in the study by Wijngarden et al., delayed adrenal response was not included in the final results (<xref rid=""B3"" ref-type=""bibr"">3</xref>). In contrast, in the study by Obrynba et al., CAI was excluded in all 21 participants with PWS using the metyrapone test, although 29% of them simultaneously failed LDAT (<xref rid=""B8"" ref-type=""bibr"">8</xref>). Analyzing the results of this study, it is worth noting that the authors started LDATs in all patients at 10:00 p.m. This is the period of the day when cortisol levels are at their lowest, which is why such a high incidence of CAI can be a false-negative test result. Moreover, after the LDAT was completed, metyrapone was administered at midnight on the same day. The adrenal glands were “primed” with ACTH, and this may be the reason why the cortisol response in this test with metyrapone was not delayed (<xref rid=""B8"" ref-type=""bibr"">8</xref>). Grootjen et al., who also used the test with metyrapone, excluded CAI in all patients with PWS (<xref rid=""B19"" ref-type=""bibr"">19</xref>). However, in almost 30% of their patients, the authors repeated tests. In some patients, they even repeated the test more the twice. In all studies that used the metyrapone test, the majority of patients were treated with rhGH. Overall, two of the three studies diagnosing HPAA in patients with PWS using the test with metyrapone excluded CAI, and one indicated a high incidence of CAI. LDAT was used to diagnose HPAA in patients with PWS in five studies. In two of them, it allowed the exclusion of CAI (<xref rid=""B4"" ref-type=""bibr"">4</xref>, <xref rid=""B5"" ref-type=""bibr"">5</xref>). In one analyzed previously, the incidence of CAI was 29% but most likely due to false-positive results (<xref rid=""B8"" ref-type=""bibr"">8</xref>). In the study by Corrias et al., LDAT indicated a CAI prevalence of 14.2%, but it was verified with the standard ACTH test and the prevalence dropped to 4.8% (<xref rid=""B6"" ref-type=""bibr"">6</xref>). However, there are opinions that the standard ACTH test is not a good tool in the diagnostics of CAI (<xref rid=""B14"" ref-type=""bibr"">14</xref>), and there is a report indicating that both the standard test and LDAT had a similar diagnostic accuracy in adults and children using different peak serum cortisol cutoff values (<xref rid=""B16"" ref-type=""bibr"">16</xref>). In our study, LDAT allowed for the diagnosis of CAI in one patient (2.2% of all patients with PWS studied), but it was not confirmed by another test. HIIT was used in three studies, and two of them excluded CAH in all patients with PWS (<xref rid=""B7"" ref-type=""bibr"">7</xref>, <xref rid=""B17"" ref-type=""bibr"">17</xref>), while one study reported a low 6% prevalence of CAI but was not verified by another test (<xref rid=""B4"" ref-type=""bibr"">4</xref>). In a study by Beauloye et al., CAI was suspected based on an insufficient peak cortisol value of 16.6 μg/dL after insulin injection, but this patient’s cortisol delta was 9.97 μg/dL and CAI was eventually ruled out (<xref rid=""B15"" ref-type=""bibr"">15</xref>). Two studies used GST in the diagnostics of HPAA, and in both studies, CAI was excluded (<xref rid=""B17"" ref-type=""bibr"">17</xref>). Untreated GH deficiency may mask CAI. Low insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) levels result in increased expression and activity of 11β-HSD1, the enzyme that converts cortisone to cortisol (<xref rid=""B20"" ref-type=""bibr"">20</xref>). Our study, or none of the previously cited studies, is unlikely to confirm a strong association between CAI prevalence and rhGH treatment. Studies assessing HPAA in patients with PWS untreated with rhGH or treated in the minority did not report cases with CAI (<xref rid=""B5"" ref-type=""bibr"">5</xref>, <xref rid=""B7"" ref-type=""bibr"">7</xref>, <xref rid=""B17"" ref-type=""bibr"">17</xref>). When patients were treated with rhGH, the prevalence of CAH amounted to 0%–60%; however, only in one study was this prevalence high—60% (<xref rid=""B3"" ref-type=""bibr"">3</xref>); in was low in two studies: 2.2% (our data) and 4.8% (<xref rid=""B6"" ref-type=""bibr"">6</xref>), and three studies found no evidence of CAI (<xref rid=""B8"" ref-type=""bibr"">8</xref>, <xref rid=""B18"" ref-type=""bibr"">18</xref>, <xref rid=""B19"" ref-type=""bibr"">19</xref>). Based on our data and a review of the literature on the incidence of CAI in children and adolescents with PWS, we do not recommend a routine diagnostics of HPAA in this group of patients. If the clinical picture suggests CAI in patients with PWS, an appropriate test should be used and confirmed with another test. Our study, similar to that of Obrynda et al. and Grootjen et al., clearly indicates that the suspicion of CAI in one test should be verified by another test (<xref rid=""B8"" ref-type=""bibr"">8</xref>, <xref rid=""B19"" ref-type=""bibr"">19</xref>). It is known that cortisol levels in a stressful situation are not a good diagnostic tool in the diagnosis of HPAA in patients with PWS. However, based on the results of recent data published by Angulo et al., morning ACTH and cortisol levels may be reliable and helpful in monitoring HPAA function (<xref rid=""B18"" ref-type=""bibr"">18</xref>). The authors found that patients with PWS had significantly lower morning cortisol levels than the control group, although in both groups, morning cortisol and ACTH levels were in the normal range. Our study did not confirm this observation because in 12% of our patients with PWS treated with rhGH, morning cortisol levels were below normal, but tests ruled out CAI in all of them. In contrast, the only patient with CAI confirmation in single LDAT had normal morning cortisol levels. Since all of our patients with WPS treated and untreated with rhGH had normal morning ACTH levels, it was the morning ACTH level that appears to be more reliable for CAH screening in this group of patients. The low incidence of CAI in pediatric patients with PWS is presented according to the latest literature. Therefore, routine screening of HPAA function is not recommended for all patients with PWS, both treated and untreated with rhGH. According to the review of the literature, signs and symptoms or low morning ACTH levels suggestive of CAI require urgent and appropriate diagnosis of HPAA by stimulation test.

Puberty in girls with Prader-Willi syndrome: cohort evaluation and clinical recommendations in a Latin American tertiary center,,"Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) is a genetic disorder resulted from the loss of paternal alleles in the 15.11q3 region (<xref rid=""B1"" ref-type=""bibr"">1</xref>). Genetic abnormalities include paternal deletion (60–75%), maternal uniparental disomy 15 (mUPD, 20–35%), imprinting center defect (ICD, 1–4%) and paternal chromosomal translocation (0.1%) (<xref rid=""B1"" ref-type=""bibr"">1</xref>, <xref rid=""B2"" ref-type=""bibr"">2</xref>). PWS is characterized by neonatal hypotonia, early-onset obesity, neurodevelopmental delay, behavioral issues and hypothalamic-pituitary deficiencies, including hypogonadism (<xref rid=""B1"" ref-type=""bibr"">1</xref>, <xref rid=""B3"" ref-type=""bibr"">3</xref>). Hypogonadism’s etiology and manifestation may exhibit variability among affected individuals (<xref rid=""B1"" ref-type=""bibr"">1</xref>, <xref rid=""B2"" ref-type=""bibr"">2</xref>). In girls with PWS, hypogonadism can present early in childhood, leading to genital hypoplasia, followed by delayed puberty, incomplete pubertal development, and infertility (<xref rid=""B3"" ref-type=""bibr"">3</xref>). The presence of hypogonadism may lead to altered body composition, muscle weakness, poor body image, and reduced bone density, with limited data on its impact on cognition (<xref rid=""B4"" ref-type=""bibr"">4</xref>). The etiology of hypogonadism in girls with PWS can be explained by a combination of primary gonadal insufficiency and hypothalamic dysfunction (<xref rid=""B5"" ref-type=""bibr"">5</xref>–<xref rid=""B9"" ref-type=""bibr"">9</xref>). The deletion of the SNORD 116 gene is associated with decreased transcription factors linked to the production of the enzyme proconvertase 1. The proconvertase 1 is responsible to convert pro-gonadotrophin releasing hormone (GnRH) into GnRH. Consequently, girls with PWS have reduced GnRH and subsequently diminished luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) pulses (<xref rid=""B10"" ref-type=""bibr"">10</xref>, <xref rid=""B11"" ref-type=""bibr"">11</xref>). It has been reported that some girls may experience precocious puberty (<xref rid=""B1"" ref-type=""bibr"">1</xref>–<xref rid=""B3"" ref-type=""bibr"">3</xref>). In contrast to hypogonadism and with uncertain etiology, premature pubarche is also seen in girls with PWS (<xref rid=""B12"" ref-type=""bibr"">12</xref>). Puberty is a dynamic process influenced by environmental and genetic factors Physiologically, puberty in girls typically commences between the ages of 8 and 13 years [13.14,15]. In the majority of cases, pubertal development in girls initiates with thelarche, followed by pubarche, and, lastly, menarche (<xref rid=""B13"" ref-type=""bibr"">13</xref>).. Traditionally, menarche occurs, on average, 2.3 years after the onset of thelarche (<xref rid=""B13"" ref-type=""bibr"">13</xref>, <xref rid=""B14"" ref-type=""bibr"">14</xref>). Hormone replacement with estrogen, usually starting between 11- and 13-year-old, is the recommended therapy for female pediatric patients with hypogonadism in many syndromic scenarios other than PWS (e.g.: Turner Syndrome, Kallmann Syndrome, central tumors, chemotherapy) (<xref rid=""B15"" ref-type=""bibr"">15</xref>, <xref rid=""B16"" ref-type=""bibr"">16</xref>). Recently, a study based on a retrospective Dutch cohort suggested estrogen replacement therapy as the clinical recommendations for adult women with PWS and hypogonadism (<xref rid=""B17"" ref-type=""bibr"">17</xref>). Currently, there are no recommendations regarding hormone replacement therapy in pediatric female patients with PWS and hypogonadism. Most studies that looked at puberty and adrenarche in girls with PWS are limited to case reports or case series, predominantly described in European, Israeli and North American populations (<xref rid=""B8"" ref-type=""bibr"">8</xref>, <xref rid=""B9"" ref-type=""bibr"">9</xref>, <xref rid=""B12"" ref-type=""bibr"">12</xref>, <xref rid=""B18"" ref-type=""bibr"">18</xref>). Our study looked at a large cohort of girls with PWS in a Tertiary University Hospital in Brazil. Our objective was to assess, describe and explore potential associations between clinical, biochemical, and imaging characteristics regarding puberty progression in girls with PWS. We then suggest a hormone replacement protocol tailored to female pediatric patients with PWS and hypogonadism. Our study included female pediatric patients with PWS followed at the University of São Paulo Pediatric Outpatient Clinic from February 2002 to December 2022. Longitudinal retrospective data collected through chart review included clinical information on birth weight and length, breast and pubic hair Tanner stages (including age, bone age, and body mass index [BMI] z-score relative to these stages), presence of genital hypoplasia, age at menarche, regularity of menstrual cycles, body mass index (BMI) z-score, final height, age of initiation of estrogen replacement and growth hormone replacement, as well as results for PWM genetic subtype; biochemical investigation (LH, FSH, estradiol, dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEA-S)); radiographic bone age and pelvic ultrasound. Patients were seen at least twice a year. Pubertal stage based on the Tanner classification (<xref rid=""B14"" ref-type=""bibr"">14</xref>) was evaluated by a pediatric endocrinologist at each visit (Breast- B1 to B4 and pubic hair P1 to P4). Standing height was measured using a <italic toggle=""yes"">Harpenden</italic> stadiometer, and weight was assessed on an accurate scale. Standard deviation scores (SDS) for height and BMI were computed according to World Health Organization (WHO) values (<xref rid=""B19"" ref-type=""bibr"">19</xref>). Blood samples were all performed by the same laboratory at our center and included serum levels of LH, FSH, estradiol (immunochemiluminescence method), and DHEA-S (chemiluminescence method). Radiographic bone age was determined using the <italic toggle=""yes"">Greulich and Pyle Atlas</italic> and pelvic ultrasound was performed via supra-pubic by the same radiology team in our center. Statistical analysis was performed using GraphPad Prism. Continuous variables were presented as median (maximum and minimum value) or mean ± standard deviation, as appropriated. Categorical variables were presented as frequency and percentage. For categorical variables, differences were calculated using Fishers exact test or chi-square test; for no categorical variables evaluated during the follow-up ANOVA; p-values < 0.05 were considered statistically significant. A total of 72 female pediatric patients with PWS were selected through chart review. Three patients were excluded due to missing data. The remaining 69 patients were included in the study (<xref rid=""T1"" ref-type=""table"">
<bold>Table 1</bold>
</xref>). Of those 18 were pre-pubertal with an age younger than 7 years. The distribution of the different types of genetic mutation were described in <xref rid=""T1"" ref-type=""table"">
<bold>Table 1</bold>
</xref>. In 14% of cases, the DNA methylation test at the SNURF- SNRPN locus confirmed the syndrome, as this test detect 99% of cases with high specificity and sensitivity but cannot differentiate genetic subtypes. From the fifty-one girls older than 7 years, fifteen were at tanner stage B1, 4 cases were diagnosed with precocious thelarche between age 7 and 8, with one case of central precocious puberty confirmed with a gonadotropin stimulation test and treated with GnRH analogue. Thirty-two patients started puberty at a mean age of 10.2 ± 1.8years and after around 4.7 years progressed to Tanner B4. Only 5 progressed to spontaneous menarche. Tanner stages, chronological and bone ages and clinical diagnoses of puberty are illustrated in <xref rid=""f1"" ref-type=""fig"">
<bold>Figures 1</bold>
</xref>, <xref rid=""f2"" ref-type=""fig"">
<bold>2A</bold>
</xref>. Girls with PWS reached puberty levels of LH and estradiol at a mean age of 11.8 ± 2.9 years and 11.6 ± 3.2 years, respectively (n=34, missed data=2). Nine patients exhibited basal stimulated LH (mean value: 1.9 ± 1.3 UI/L) one year after thelarche (Tanner B2) and 12 patients showed higher LH levels (mean value: 2.5 ± 1.7 UI/L) two years after reaching Tanner B2 (<xref rid=""f3"" ref-type=""fig"">
<bold>Figure 3</bold>
</xref>). No patient had FSH above 15 UI/L. Although LH increased during Tanner stages, estradiol levels remained low (<xref rid=""f3"" ref-type=""fig"">
<bold>Figure 3</bold>
</xref>). At 15 years of age, 29.1% (n=7/24) of girls with PWS achieved Tanner B4, and 5 patients presented spontaneous menarche. Among those, uterus volume estimated via supra pubic ultrasound ranged between 10 and 17 cc, except for one case who presented with a volume of 28 cc. This patient was the only one who had regular menstrual cycles. Data related to pubarche and adrenarche was evaluated in 42 of the 69 patients since 27 had no adrenarche. From these, 17 presented with early adrenarche. Mean DHEA-S levels at the onset of precocious adrenarche were 664.68 ng/mL (reference value: < 194ng/mL), with a significant difference in the age of DHEA-S increase (p=0.04). The mean z-BMI was 1.77 ± 1.44 SD at the commencement of precocious adrenarche. No associations were found between premature pubarche/adrenarche and final height (<xref rid=""f2"" ref-type=""fig"">
<bold>Figures 2B</bold>
</xref>, <xref rid=""f4"" ref-type=""fig"">
<bold>4</bold>
</xref>). This longitudinal retrospective cohort study revealed a significant delay in pubertal progression in female pediatric patients with PWS. Major strengths of this article were the large sample size of 69 patients. Length of the study encompassed more than 20 years and the fact that it was conducted at the largest tertiary center in Latin America that has a dedicated multi-disciplinary and multiprofessional PWS clinic. Premature adrenarche was frequent, but its evolution and impact seemed to be limited, and the puberty development was impaired. As a response, we suggest a pubertal induction protocol for PWS girls in our service, emphasizing the potential benefits of hormone replacement therapy. The onset of puberty in our sample was aligned with other studies (<xref rid=""B8"" ref-type=""bibr"">8</xref>, <xref rid=""B9"" ref-type=""bibr"">9</xref>), occurring at a typical age of 10.2 years, with 91.3% of patients reaching breast Tanner stage B3 by the age of 13 years. We found a significant delay in pubertal progression (4.7 years between Tanner stage B2 and B4), with almost 30% of patients never reaching breast Tanner stage B4 by the age of 15 years. A study in Brazil, involving 665 healthy girls, reported that thelarche, pubarche, and menarche occurred at a mean age of 9.8, 10.2, and 11.7 years, respectively (<xref rid=""B13"" ref-type=""bibr"">13</xref>). It’s been reported that although most girls with PWS experience spontaneous breast development around the age of 12.6 years, most of them slowly progress through the pubertal stages and are usually delayed in reaching breast Tanner B5 or complete pubertal development (<xref rid=""B8"" ref-type=""bibr"">8</xref>, <xref rid=""B9"" ref-type=""bibr"">9</xref>). We also saw a delayed mean age of LH and estradiol elevation which was not in alignment with Tanner stages. In our study, only 5 girls experienced spontaneous menarche, at a mean age of 14.9 years. Those girls also experience irregular cycles and small uterus size Previous studies reported that only 8 to 44% of girls with PWS present with spontaneous menarche (<xref rid=""B6"" ref-type=""bibr"">6</xref>, <xref rid=""B8"" ref-type=""bibr"">8</xref>, <xref rid=""B9"" ref-type=""bibr"">9</xref>, <xref rid=""B11"" ref-type=""bibr"">11</xref>, <xref rid=""B12"" ref-type=""bibr"">12</xref>), and the majority develop irregular menstrual cycles (e.g.: oligomenorrhea, periodic spotting, and secondary amenorrhea) (<xref rid=""B9"" ref-type=""bibr"">9</xref>, <xref rid=""B12"" ref-type=""bibr"">12</xref>). The mean age of menarche reported by those studies varied between 14, 17 and 20 years (<xref rid=""B8"" ref-type=""bibr"">8</xref>, <xref rid=""B9"" ref-type=""bibr"">9</xref>, <xref rid=""B12"" ref-type=""bibr"">12</xref>). We speculate that a proportion of the vaginal bleeding considered in previous studies as spontaneous menarche in girls with PWS may not indicate normal ovarian function or true menarche. Instead, it could be a result of the uterine endometrium estrogenization caused by the estrogen synthesized through the peripheral conversion of adrenal androgens (<xref rid=""B9"" ref-type=""bibr"">9</xref>). The prevalence of hypogonadism in girls with PWS ranges from 54% to 100%, with the majority of studies indicating a prevalence higher than 80% (<xref rid=""B1"" ref-type=""bibr"">1</xref>–<xref rid=""B4"" ref-type=""bibr"">4</xref>, <xref rid=""B9"" ref-type=""bibr"">9</xref>). The etiology of the hypogonadism reported in girls with PWS was secondary (central) in 53.8%, primary (gonadal failure) in 7.7% and a combination of both primary and secondary in 38.4% (<xref rid=""B6"" ref-type=""bibr"">6</xref>, <xref rid=""B17"" ref-type=""bibr"">17</xref>, <xref rid=""B18"" ref-type=""bibr"">18</xref>, <xref rid=""B20"" ref-type=""bibr"">20</xref>, <xref rid=""B21"" ref-type=""bibr"">21</xref>). Genital abnormalities, an indirect sign of hypogonadism, were seen in 67,7% of our sample. An Italian study with 42 girls with PWS reported genital abnormalities in 70% of cases (<xref rid=""B9"" ref-type=""bibr"">9</xref>). Our study had one patient diagnosed with central precocious puberty. Previous studies also reported the presence of central precocious puberty, characterized by advancing bone age and increased growth velocity, although not always leading to early menarche (<xref rid=""B8"" ref-type=""bibr"">8</xref>, <xref rid=""B9"" ref-type=""bibr"">9</xref>, <xref rid=""B22"" ref-type=""bibr"">22</xref>–<xref rid=""B24"" ref-type=""bibr"">24</xref>). One case was treated with a GnRH analogue (<xref rid=""B9"" ref-type=""bibr"">9</xref>). The presence of mutations in the MKRN3, an imprinted gene located in the critical region of PWS on chromosome 15, was associated with familial precocious puberty and might explain it (<xref rid=""B25"" ref-type=""bibr"">25</xref>). As expected, the onset of adrenarche occurred at a younger age (mean age of 7.81 ± 1.94 years), with the onset of early adrenarche occurring in 40.4% of the girls in our sample. Previous studies reported similar findings with a prevalence of early pubarche in girls with PWS ranging from 30% to 64% (<xref rid=""B12"" ref-type=""bibr"">12</xref>, <xref rid=""B26"" ref-type=""bibr"">26</xref>),. Pubic hair development after reaching Tanner stage P2 occurred at a normal rate until stage P3, and then slowed down. This is comparable to other studies. Pubic hair progression in our study was less pronounced than in the Dutch group described by Siemensma et al., although the average ages reaching P3, P4, and P5 were comparable. Our study found that girls with PWS reached P2 and P3 at significantly younger ages compared to healthy Dutch children (<xref rid=""B12"" ref-type=""bibr"">12</xref>). Gaston and Stafford, analyzed 25 girls with PWS aged over 9 years and found that 64% of them had early pubarche, reaching P2 at a mean age of 7.3 years. Subsequent progress to P3 occurred at a mean age of 9.6 years, to P4 at 11.7 years, and to P5 at 16.8 years (<xref rid=""B26"" ref-type=""bibr"">26</xref>). These variations may be attributed to the diverse characteristics of the studied groups and multiple influencing factors on adrenarche in PWS, such as obesity, recombinant human growth hormone (rHGH) treatment, and environmental factors. In our sample, girls with PWS with or without precocious puberty showed a similar bone age at Tanner stage P4. We speculate that the effects of adrenal androgens were likely temporary and had a limited impact on final height compared to the influence of puberty progression. Unfortunately, because of the young age of our study population, not all patients have yet attained final height, which might have impacted the results. In our sample, girls who presented with premature adrenarche exhibited increased levels of DHEA-S at a younger age. It has been reported that in children with PWS, DHEA-S levels can be increased earlier, remaining elevated throughout childhood (<xref rid=""B26"" ref-type=""bibr"">26</xref>), but returning to normal levels in adulthood (<xref rid=""B8"" ref-type=""bibr"">8</xref>). Given the common occurrence of hypothalamic dysfunction in children with PWS, data suggest that increased DHEA-S levels may occur with less or even without any stimulation from the pituitary-adrenal-axis. The observation that pubarche progression was minimal after Tanner stage P4 for pubic hair may indicate that a normal pituitary-gonadal axis is crucial to reach Tanner stage P5. Studies conducted in other syndromes with hypogonadism, such as Turner syndrome and central hypopituitarism, have demonstrated that estrogen replacement therapy contributes to a reduction in cardiovascular risk, improvement in bone mineral density, and cognitive enhancements, including motor speed as well as verbal and nonverbal processing time (<xref rid=""B15"" ref-type=""bibr"">15</xref>, <xref rid=""B16"" ref-type=""bibr"">16</xref>, <xref rid=""B27"" ref-type=""bibr"">27</xref>). Additionally, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-based investigations highlight the critical role of pubertal maturation and sex steroids in shaping brain structure, particularly during adolescence (<xref rid=""B28"" ref-type=""bibr"">28</xref>). It is evident that, while age can serve as a parameter for general developmental changes, pubertal maturation exerts unique and additive influences on structural neurodevelopmental trajectories. In patients with pre-existing hormone deficiencies of varying degrees, the inadequate myelination can potentially lead to premature aging and further impairment of the cerebral cortex and social performance (<xref rid=""B28"" ref-type=""bibr"">28</xref>). Moreover, in female adults with PWS there is a high prevalence of osteopenia (54%) and osteoporosis (14%), both important comorbidities related to estrogen deficiency (<xref rid=""B29"" ref-type=""bibr"">29</xref>). We acknowledge that this is a retrospective observational study and it comes with its pitfalls. PWS is a rare genetic disease, making it difficult the development of prospective studies. The high prevalence of hypogonadism in our population led us to develop a pubertal induction protocol for girls with PWS in our service. Previous studies have shown the benefits of pubertal induction, encompassing multiple improvements in bone mineral density, body composition, psychological well-being, cognitive function, and cardiovascular aspects (<xref rid=""B15"" ref-type=""bibr"">15</xref>, <xref rid=""B16"" ref-type=""bibr"">16</xref>, <xref rid=""B28"" ref-type=""bibr"">28</xref>, <xref rid=""B29"" ref-type=""bibr"">29</xref>). Hormone replacement therapy initiation may be delayed in patients with cognitive impairments due to factors like fear or lack of awareness of its benefits. However, it’s crucial to communicate and discuss the anticipated benefits with both patients and caregivers, highlighting the potential advantages of hormone replacement therapy. We advocate for the treatment of hypogonadism in girls with PWS (<xref rid=""f5"" ref-type=""fig"">
<bold>Figure 5</bold>
</xref>). Since the clinical (Tanner stages) and laboratory findings of puberty (LH, FSH, estradiol) may not be consistent and may differ between patients, we propose adopting the volume of the uterus seen in a supra-pubic ultrasound as an additional parameter for this protocol. The uterus size was based on pubertal stages and the normal uterus growth from childhood to adulthood (<xref rid=""B30"" ref-type=""bibr"">30</xref>, <xref rid=""B31"" ref-type=""bibr"">31</xref>). Tanner stages could be difficult to be determined in children with obesity, especially when associate with a non-linear puberty progression. We recommend that the induction therapy with estrogen should start at the minimal age of 12–13 years of chronological or bone age, and breast Tanner stage I or no progression of breast development for more than one year or irregular menstrual cycles (<xref rid=""B15"" ref-type=""bibr"">15</xref>, <xref rid=""B16"" ref-type=""bibr"">16</xref>, <xref rid=""B27"" ref-type=""bibr"">27</xref>).. For pubertal induction in girls with PWS, initial prescription of transdermal patches is typically recommended due to their adjustability through cutting and gradual dose escalation (<xref rid=""B15"" ref-type=""bibr"">15</xref>, <xref rid=""B27"" ref-type=""bibr"">27</xref>). However, considering the prevalence of skin-picking behavior in PWS, we suggest commencing with low-dose of 17-b-estradiol oral tablets and titrating based on uterine size. Progesterone is then introduced for a 10-day period to assess vaginal bleeding. Subsequent maintenance of induced puberty involves the use of combined contraceptives continuously or intermittently, depending on patient and caregiver preferences. Prior to treatment initiation, it’s crucial to assess thrombosis and breast cancer risk, potential drug interactions with hormonal replacement therapy, and to discuss hygiene, vaginal bleeding, behavioral changes, and possible weight gain with patients and caregivers (<xref rid=""B17"" ref-type=""bibr"">17</xref>). This emphasizes the necessity of follow-up with a multidisciplinary team, particularly for psychological support. Special attention is warranted for cases involving girls with PWS expressing sexual activity desires, necessitating heightened supervision to mitigate the risk of sexual abuse. This approach aims to tackle the specific challenges of hormonal replacement therapy in girls with PWS, fostering holistic care and enhancing health-related quality of life. Our study revealed a high prevalence of delayed puberty in girls with PWS, prompting the formulation of a recommended hormone replacement protocol for inducing puberty at a physiological age. Further prospective and multicenter studies are needed to validate these findings and refine treatment strategies.

Investigating the correlation between genotype and phenotype in Prader-Willi syndrome: a study of 45 cases from Brazil,,"Described in 1956, Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS, OMIM #176,270) is an inherited disorder characterized by signs, symptoms, and genetic factors [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR1"">1</xref>]. This genetic syndrome is characterized by a combination of signs, symptoms, and underlying genetic factors. It is mainly characterized by hypotonia, low stature, hyperphagia with subsequent obesity, neuropsychomotor development delay, endocrine deficiency, and behavioral and cognitive abnormalities [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR2"">2</xref>, <xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR3"">3</xref>]. PWS affects all sexes and races, with an estimated incidence of 1:10,000 to 1:25,000 live births [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR4"">4</xref>]. The cause of this neurodevelopmental disorder is the lack of expression of paternal copies of genes located in the 15q11-q13 region. PWS was the first human disease to be related to imprinting disorders [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR5"">5</xref>]. This genetic disorder can be caused by three different molecular mechanisms: (a) de novo deletions of the paternal copy of the 15q11-q13 region (70%); (b) maternal uniparental disomy (UPD), where there is the inheritance of two maternal alleles of chromosome 15, in contrast to the normal one allele from each parent (25%); and (c) imprinting center defects (ICD), where we can find mutations or microdeletions in this small chromosomal region (< 5%) [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR6"">6</xref>–<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR9"">9</xref>]. Although knowledge of the molecular etiology is not necessary to establish the diagnosis, genetic causes influence recurrence risk and counseling for PWS. The risk of recurrence is low, 1% for deletion and UPD but 50% for ICD with microdeletion [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR10"">10</xref>]. Comparisons of 15q11-q13 deletion versus UPD led to genotype-phenotype correlations. The PWS region is approximately 6 MB on chromosome 15 (Fig. <xref rid=""Fig1"" ref-type=""fig"">1</xref>). A type I (BP1/BP3) deletion is approximately 6 Mb, and a type II (BP2/BP3) deletion is approximately 5.3 Mb. Type I deletions cause severe problems, while type II deletions lead to less deviant behavior [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR11"">11</xref>]. UPD is associated with a higher verbal intelligence quotient (IQ) and more psychosis and autism [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR12"">12</xref>].

 The clinical diagnosis of PWS is based on the clinical presentation and findings, which present difficulties during the neonatal and early childhood period. In this period, many of its signs and symptoms are nonspecific, and typical clinical features become apparent in later life stages. In parallel, the confirmation of the syndrome can only be given through laboratory diagnosis. There are many molecular strategies that evaluate the methylation status of the 15q11-q13 region, such as: Southern blotting, methylation-specific polymerase chain reaction (MS-PCR), postrestriction PCR of bisulfite-treated DNA, and methylation-specific multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MS-MLPA) [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR14"">14</xref>]. However, all these listed techniques are laborious, expensive and time consuming to obtain a diagnosis. Consequently, high rates of diagnostic errors and delays in interventions lead to a poor prognosis for these patients. It is essential to detect individuals with PWS in the neonatal period to initiate early intervention. Early treatment includes growth hormone (GH), which not only improves height and body composition (reduces body fat and increases muscle mass) but also decreases morbidity and mortality associated with obesity-related complications. Furthermore, it is of fundamental importance to study the correlation of the clinical phenotypes and their association with the genotype [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR15"">15</xref>, <xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR16"">16</xref>]. Knowing the genetic mechanism that leads to the syndrome allows better preparation for the phenotypic complications associated with it. The objective of this study was to increase the knowledge of genotype-phenotype correlations in PWS and thus contribute to the understanding of the wide clinical spectrum observed in PWS. Blood samples were collected from 166 individuals with clinical criteria for PWS and subsequently subjected to the Methylation-sensitive high-resolution melting (MS-HRM) protocol for molecular confirmation. Of these 166 individuals, 45 (40%) had confirmed PWS and were included in the study. The positive result for PWS in this protocol is due to a change in the methylation pattern, represented by the presence of a single peak relative to the maternal allelic dissociation temperature and the absence of the peak related to the paternal allele. The amplicons were differentiated by the temperature required for double-stranded DNA dissociation (78 °C for paternal and 83 °C for maternal alleles), identifying 121 (60%) of the 166 studied patients with a normal methylation profile due to the presence of two peaks related to maternal and paternal alleles (Fig. <xref rid=""Fig2"" ref-type=""fig"">2</xref>). The MS-HRM reactions of the 45 individuals showed little variation in the amplification cycle threshold (Ct), remaining constant at 25 (Fig. <xref rid=""Fig2"" ref-type=""fig"">2</xref>).

 MS-MLPA was performed in 33 (73%). Of these, 18 (54%) were female and 15 (45%) were male. There were no discordant results between MS-HRM and MS-MLPA, with 45 patients diagnosed as having PWS and 121 non-PWS controls. Therefore, the concordance rate was 100%, and Cohen’s kappa was 1.0, indicating perfect agreement. Samples with a methylation status of approximately 50% (range between 40 and 60%) for specific PWS probes were identified as normal controls (Fig. <xref rid=""Fig3"" ref-type=""fig"">3</xref>A). In contrast, if this same status presented values close to 100% (greater than 80%), they were identified as the PWS pattern (Fig. <xref rid=""Fig3"" ref-type=""fig"">3</xref>B). In addition, the protocol allows differentiation of the deletion subtypes found in patients with PWS using the copy number data. The individuals with a deletion ranging from <italic toggle=""yes"">NIPA1</italic> to <italic toggle=""yes"">OCA2</italic> were identified as having type 1 deletions (Fig. <xref rid=""Fig4"" ref-type=""fig"">4</xref>A), while patients with a deletion ranging from <italic toggle=""yes"">MKRN3</italic> to <italic toggle=""yes"">OCA2</italic> were identified as having type 2 deletions (Fig. <xref rid=""Fig4"" ref-type=""fig"">4</xref>B).

 Of the 33 individuals analyzed in our laboratory with MS-MLPA tests, 8 (24%) had type 1 deletions, 11 (33%) had type 2 deletions, and 14 (43%) did not have deletions, indicating UPD of chromosome 15 or defects in the imprinting center (Fig. <xref rid=""Fig3"" ref-type=""fig"">3</xref>B). No individual in the study showed any atypical deletions or Robertsonian translocations. Out of a total of 45 patients, it was possible to identify the presence of deletions in 29 of them (64%) using the methodologies used in the study. The MS-MLPA method does not differentiate between cases of UPD and defects in the imprinting center. To investigate the etiology of these patients, Sanger sequencing of the promoter region of exon 1 of the <italic toggle=""yes"">SNRPN-SNURF</italic> gene was performed to evaluate base-pairing mutations and the epigenetic pattern of this region (Fig. <xref rid=""Fig5"" ref-type=""fig"">5</xref>).

 It was not possible to identify differences between the reference sequence deposited in GenBank (NG_012958.1), indicating UPD in all 14 individuals who did not show deletions in the MS-MLPA tests.

 We collaborated with the Luiz Capriglione State Institute of Diabetes and Endocrinology (IEDE/RJ) to obtain some of the clinical results of individuals in the study. IEDE was responsible for the clinical investigation. The results on clinical history, physical findings, and neurological abnormalities are organized in Table <xref rid=""Tab1"" ref-type=""table"">1</xref>. In our study, no significant differences were found between the two groups for the following data: reduced fetal activity, neonatal hypotonia, food-related behavioral problems, dental caries, scoliosis, type 2 diabetes mellitus, thick and viscous saliva, cryptorchidism, and hypoplastic labia minora.

 Behavioral problems, such as stubbornness, excoriation disorder, temperamental issues, and food-related problems, were found in approximately 58% of patients with deletions and 52% of patients with UPD. No significant difference was found between the two groups regarding excessive daytime sleepiness and an increased risk of seizures. Compared with normal individuals, patients with PWS have a delay in the development of motor coordination; however, in our study, over 30% of patients in both groups had deficits in gross and fine motor coordination. Global developmental delay was observed in 24/29 (82.8%) patients with deletions and 11/16 (68.8%) patients with UPD, but there was no significant difference between the groups. Clinical phenotypes related to the ocular system were also evaluated. In 15/29 (51.7%) patients with deletion and 4/16 (25%) patients with UPD, they presented strabismus, but without a statistically significant difference between the two groups. Myopia was shown to be more frequent in patients with deletions than in patients with UPD (31% vs. 0%). In our study, only 1 patient in the deletion group had hyperopia, while only 1 patient in the UPD group had nystagmus. Sleep integrity was evaluated through the manifestation of central sleep apnea, which was not observed in any of the patients. However, obstructive sleep apnea showed significant differences between groups, with this disorder present in 15/29 (51.7%) of patients with deletions and 3/16 (18.8%) of patients with UPD. Regarding cognitive function, unusual puzzle-solving abilities that patients with PWS can present showed a significant difference between the groups, with a higher frequency in patients with deletions than in patients with UPD (48.3% vs. 6.3%). As previously mentioned, PWS has some clinical signs and symptoms that are very characteristic of these patients. In our study population, severe neonatal hypotonia that improved with age was detected in all cases (45 individuals). Feeding problems in childhood, hyperphagia, hypogonadism, and mild dysmorphic signs, such as almond-shaped eyes, downturned corners of the mouth, thin upper lip, and small hands and feet, did not differ significantly in our study. The data are summarized below in Table <xref rid=""Tab1"" ref-type=""table"">1</xref>. Common molecular categories such as deletions and UPDs exhibit significant differences in clinical features. Paternal absence is associated with significant nutritional problems, sleep disturbances, depigmentation, speech impairment, and other symptoms [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR17"">17</xref>]. Conversely, cases of UPD are often associated with prolonged gestation, increased verbal IQ, psychosis, and autism [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR18"">18</xref>]. However, a UPD patient is less likely to have her PWS facies and pigmentation. To date, no genetic mutation has been described as a contributor to the devolopment of the syndrome. In a previous study, our group proposed an individualized analysis of genes and their role in the devolopment of clinical phenotypes. As has been demonstrated in this paper, the extensive clinical spectrum and the absence of a genotype phenotype specific correlation suggest that the multiple genes associated with PWS have an additive deleterious effect when deficiently expressed. Nevertheless, the lack of expression of the <italic toggle=""yes"">SNORD116</italic> gene cluster appear to be the best explanation for most of the PWS phenotype, although there is a need to investigate more of its mechanisms of action [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR13"">13</xref>]. After that, the next step was to analyze if there was a genotype–phenotype correlation of our patients. Clinical data from 45 PWS patients, mostly aged 1–28 years (mean 9 years), showed a frequency of 64.4% in deletion and 35.6% in UPD groups, slightly consistent with previous studies [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR7"">7</xref>, <xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR19"">19</xref>]. Studies have also found an older maternal age within her UPD groups compared to deletions [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR4"">4</xref>, <xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR20"">20</xref>, <xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR21"">21</xref>]. In particular, data on maternal age were not available in our study, however national statistics from DataSUS [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR22"">22</xref>] show that between 2005 and 2020, maternal age increased annually in Brazil, especially in the 30–34 and 35–39 age groups, with increases of 28% and 62.6%, respectively. The higher frequency of UPD patients found in our study may be attributed, in part, to current trend of later pregnancies among women, which is a risk factor to the occurrence of UPD. In our cohort, we also conducted an analysis of the age at diagnostics, which ranged from 5 months to 23 years, with a median age of 1 year and 4 months, highlighting the crucial role of the reference laboratory in molecular diagnostics of PWS. Regarding the possible influence of sex on patients with PWS, previous studies have shown discrepant results. Sanjeeva et al. [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR23"">23</xref>] highlighted a higher prevalence of diagnoses in boys than in girls, while Gunay-Aygun et al. [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR24"">24</xref>] reported a similar gender ratio. In our study, the gender ratio among PWS patients was approximately 1:1 (21 boys and 24 girls). Although our results do not manifest this difference between genders, certain specific signs, and symptoms of the syndrome, such as cryptorchidism, are more easily identifiable in boys. Establishing some level of complexity in the clinical diagnosis of these patients. This study investigated the main clinical phenotypes in newborns with PWS, including severe neonatal hypotonia that improves with age (100%), almond-shaped eyes (86.6%), failure to thrive in childhood (82.2%), reduced fetal activity (80%), cryptorchidism (77.2%), and weak crying (62.2%). The results of WANG et al. [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR25"">25</xref>] presented rates of hypotonia and weak crying higher than 95%, which is consistent with our data on hypotonia; however, the difference in results regarding weak crying may be explained by the fact that this clinical sign is subjectively judged by physicians. Hypothalamic dysfunction underlies the major symptoms of patients with PWS [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR26"">26</xref>, <xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR27"">27</xref>]. Symptoms of genital maldevelopment vary by gender, affecting the genitalia in men and the clitoris or genitalia in women. Male signs are evident at birth, whereas unlike male signs, female signs during the neonatal period can be obscured by obesity [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR28"">28</xref>, <xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR29"">29</xref>]. In our study, 90.5% of 21 men had such symptoms, whereas only 29.1% of 24 women had such symptoms. Clinical observation bias could impact the analysis outcomes. In this study, all cases of hypopigmentation were observed in patients with a deletion. However, this finding did not show a statistically significant difference in our analysis. We found a lower incidence of skin hypopigmentation (20.7%) in our study group compared to the 70–100% incidence of cutaneous hypopigmentation described in different studies [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR24"">24</xref>, <xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR30"">30</xref>]. One possible explanation that should be investigated by us is the ethnic groups of the patients, as skin hypopigmentation is less easily identified among Caucasian individuals. The discrepancies can be attributed to (a) small sample sizes that are susceptible to selection bias or (b) the absence of a standardized clinical evaluation for skin hypopigmentation that is easily overlooked. Therefore, to determine if our results align with these studies, we need to increase the sample size, standardize the evaluation criteria, and conduct further research. The analysis of 54 cases of pediatric patients with PWS by Cassidy et al. [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR31"">31</xref>] reported that the incidence rate of skin hypopigmentation in cases associated with deletion is much higher than that in UPD. Analyzing the structure of the genomic region of chromosome 15 associated with PWS, we observed the presence of the <italic toggle=""yes"">OCA2</italic> gene associated with type 2 oculocutaneous albinism, tyrosinase-positive. This gene is within the different breakpoints that lead to the appearance of two different deletion sizes. In the present study, it was not possible to identify patients with defects in the imprinting center. The use of MS-MLPA confirmed the diagnosis by MS-HRM and in some cases allowed the identification of some deletions in 58% of the patients. Due to a limitation of the technique, individuals where deletions were not identified (52%) were analyzed indirectly for UPD and directly for the imprinting center defect. In summary, hypotonia, feeding difficulties, and underdeveloped genital are general clinical features of PWS. Hypopigmentation of the skin, poor development of sex glands, specific facial characteristics, GH deficiency, and other characteristics described in Table <xref rid=""Tab1"" ref-type=""table"">1</xref> did not show significant differences between deletion and UPD. Sinnema et al. [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR32"">32</xref>] reported that patients with PWS have higher rates of maladaptive behaviors compared to other syndromes with intellectual disability. Webb et al. [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR33"">33</xref>] suggested that UPD cases have milder maladaptive behaviors compared to deletion cases but have a higher risk of autism spectrum disorders and psychosis. In our study, myopia showed a significant difference between the groups (<italic toggle=""yes"">p</italic> < 0.05). Myopia, following the diagnostic criteria established by Holm et al. [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR2"">2</xref>], is considered a minor criterion and is associated with deletion. One possible molecular explanation is the loss of the <italic toggle=""yes"">HERC2</italic> gene. This gene belongs to the <italic toggle=""yes"">HERC</italic> gene family, which encodes a group of proteins that have various structural domains. All members have at least one copy of an N-terminal region showing homology to the cell cycle regulator RCC1, and a C-terminal HECT domain (homologous to the C-terminus of E6-AP) found in a series of ubiquitin protein ligase E3s. Genetic variations in this gene are associated with variability in skin, hair, and eye pigmentation. Several pseudogenes of this gene are located on chromosomes 15 and 16. This gene is also associated with the development of refractive abnormalities characterized by the ability to see near objects, which is associated with the phenotype of myopia [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR13"">13</xref>]. Hypothalamic dysfunction is associated with clinical phenotypes such as hyperphagia and obesity in PWS due to hypometabolism. GH deficiency is common because GH affects IGF-I synthesis [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR34"">34</xref>]. Regarding obstructive sleep apnea, a significant difference was observed, with a higher frequency in deletion cases than in UPD cases (<italic toggle=""yes"">p</italic> < 0.05). This condition may be associated with hypothalamic endocrine dysfunction that affects ventilatory control, leading to sleep-disordered breathing (SDB) [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR35"">35</xref>]. From a molecular point of view, consultation with the Human Phenotype Ontology– HPO, using the key term obstructive sleep apnea, resulted in the association of genes and diseases present in the molecular region of PWS. For example, <italic toggle=""yes"">MAGEL2</italic> deletion has been associated with Prader-Willi-like syndrome (ORPHA ID:398,069), including a UPD case (ORPHA ID:98,754) with a role for the <italic toggle=""yes"">SNRPN</italic>, <italic toggle=""yes"">OCA2</italic>, <italic toggle=""yes"">MAGEL2</italic>, and <italic toggle=""yes"">NDN</italic> genes. Deletion outcomes vary by type (ORPHA ID: 98,793, ORPHA ID: 177,901), including type 2 genes such as <italic toggle=""yes"">SNORD116-1</italic>, <italic toggle=""yes"">SNRPN</italic>, <italic toggle=""yes"">SNORD115-1</italic>, <italic toggle=""yes"">OCA2</italic>, <italic toggle=""yes"">MAGEL2</italic>, <italic toggle=""yes"">NDN</italic>, and their role in the development of apnea. and the desired phenotype are revealed. Despite research on PWS, little is known about its cognitive aspects. Patients with PWS often have mild to moderate intellectual disability, poor short-term memory, improved visual motor skills, and spatial awareness [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR18"">18</xref>, <xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR36"">36</xref>]. People with PWS are known to have a special talent for putting puzzles together. Compared to other individuals with some form of intellectual disability reported, the parents of these patients had a greater pleasure their children had with puzzle assembly. Holm et al. [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR2"">2</xref>], based on clinical impressions, included the unusual ability with puzzles as a supportive criterion for the clinical diagnosis of PWS. This unusual ability with puzzles can be explained due to the visual-motor strengths that many of these patients present, as well as their obsessive-compulsive tendencies, need for order, accuracy, and for things to be “just right” [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR37"">37</xref>]. Dykens [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR18"">18</xref>] was the first to examine clinical impressions that people with PWS have puzzle and word search abilities. In our study, this significant difference was observed more frequently in deletion cases than in DUP cases (<italic toggle=""yes"">p</italic> < 0.05). Consistent with our results, Dykens showed that DUM patients performed worse than paternal deletion patients with puzzle assembly abilities. Due to the lack of studies regarding this finding, little is still known about how the lack of information derived from the paternal allele on chromosome 15 is associated with puzzle assembly abilities or why they vary among genetic subtypes. HOLM and colleagues [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR2"">2</xref>] developed a preclinical form for identifying individuals with suspected PWS, considering age, and creating a scoring system for diagnosis. Observing the results of these studies, we see that individuals present major within the criteria and that differences in favor of deletion, such as myopia and obstructive sleep apnea, were observed in minor characteristics. Additionally, in our population, we see these differences in supportive criteria, where in favor of deletion, the unusual ability with puzzles was a statistically significant finding. This makes sense since the molecular screening (MS-HRM) and clinical diagnoses were consistent. The silencing of the <italic toggle=""yes"">MKRN3, NDN</italic>, and <italic toggle=""yes"">SNRPN-SNURF</italic> genes present on maternal chromosome 15 is associated with specific CpG island methylation in the promoter region of these genes [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR38"">38</xref>], while their copies on the paternal allele are unmethylated and expressed. Based on the different methylation statuses of <italic toggle=""yes"">SNRPN-SNURF</italic>, combining MS-HRM and MS-MLPA techniques yields good results in diagnosis and genetic counseling. With the increasing availability and use of molecular diagnostics in clinical applications, an increasing number of patients with PWS are diagnosed at an early stage. Currently, there are few studies of PWS in large samples of newborns with Brazilian genetic constitution. This pilot study included 45 cases of PWS in Brazilians and is able to delineate the major clinical phenotypes of PWS carriers in Brazil. The good performance of MS-HRM, MS-MLPA, and Sanger sequencing tests corroborates the applicability of a diagnostic strategy that can determine the genetic alterations present in individuals with PWS. Our findings in this study on genotype-phenotype correlation demonstrate that the genetic subtypes of the syndrome are generally similar, but some differences exist between subtypes. According to our tests and statistical analyses, significant correlations were found between the genotype and phenotype of patients. Clinical signs such as myopia, obstructive sleep apnea, and unusual puzzle-solving ability were more frequent in patients with genetic deletions. Although the data are still limited for clear recommendations, it seems to be very promising, and more studies should be done to analyze this hypothesis. ",N/A,20 6 2024
Quality of Life for Adults with Prader–Willi Syndrome in Residential Group Homes,"<bold>Background</bold>: Strict regimens of restricted caloric intake and daily physical exercise are life-saving in Prader–Willi syndrome (PWS) but are extremely challenging in home environments. PWS-specialized hostels (SH) succeed in preventing morbid obesity and in coping with behavioral disorders; however, effects of restricted living environments on quality of life (QOL) have not been described. Evidence on QOL is critical for clinicians involved in placement decisions. <bold>Methods</bold>: We examined the impact of living in SH versus at home or in non-specialized hostels (H and NSH) on QOL, behavior, and health parameters. All 58 adults (26 males) followed-up in the National Multidisciplinary Clinic for PWS were included: 33 resided in SH, 18 lived at home, and 7 lived in NSH. Questionnaires were administered to primary caregivers to measure QOL, and data were obtained from the medical records. <bold>Results</bold>: The H and NSH group were compared with those for adults in SH. Despite strict diet and exercise regimens, QOL was similar for both groups. Eight-year follow-up showed that food-seeking behavior decreased in SH but increased in H and NSH. BMI, cholesterol, and triglyceride levels were lower in SH. <bold>Conclusions</bold>: Our results suggest that living in SH is associated with benefits for physical health and behavior without negatively affecting QOL.","Prader–Willi Syndrome (PWS) is a complex neurogenetic disorder due to lack of expression of imprinted genes in the q11–q13 region of paternally inherited copies of chromosome 15. Genetic subtypes include deletions of the critical region on chromosome 15, maternal uniparental disomy, and, rarely, defects in the imprinting center. Hypotonia, feeding difficulties, and delayed developmental milestones are typical manifestations in infancy. Later in childhood, hyperphagia and lack of satiety result in excessive weight gain, leading to morbid obesity unless strict compliance with diet and exercised regimens are maintained. Other common features of PWS include behavioral and psychiatric disorders, variable degrees of cognitive disability, growth hormone deficiency, hypogonadism, and skin picking [<xref rid=""B1-jcm-13-03323"" ref-type=""bibr"">1</xref>,<xref rid=""B2-jcm-13-03323"" ref-type=""bibr"">2</xref>,<xref rid=""B3-jcm-13-03323"" ref-type=""bibr"">3</xref>]. Psychiatric disorders and behavioral problems become more prevalent with increasing age, along with a decline in functional, behavioral, and cognitive abilities [<xref rid=""B4-jcm-13-03323"" ref-type=""bibr"">4</xref>,<xref rid=""B5-jcm-13-03323"" ref-type=""bibr"">5</xref>,<xref rid=""B6-jcm-13-03323"" ref-type=""bibr"">6</xref>]. The prevalence of obesity, the leading cause of morbidity and mortality in PWS, increases from 40% in younger individuals to 82–98% in adults [<xref rid=""B2-jcm-13-03323"" ref-type=""bibr"">2</xref>,<xref rid=""B7-jcm-13-03323"" ref-type=""bibr"">7</xref>,<xref rid=""B8-jcm-13-03323"" ref-type=""bibr"">8</xref>,<xref rid=""B9-jcm-13-03323"" ref-type=""bibr"">9</xref>]. While obesity is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in PWS, even individuals with a normal BMI have a higher-than-average incidence of medical problems such as sleep disorders, skin picking, swallowing dysfunction, and abnormal gastric motility. Life expectancy of individuals with PWS has been increasing due to improved awareness of maintaining strict adherence to dietary restrictions, “food security”, and exercise programs along with early initiation of growth hormone treatment [<xref rid=""B10-jcm-13-03323"" ref-type=""bibr"">10</xref>]. The 24 h daily supervision needed to control the hyperphagia and behavioral disorders presents new challenges for families of adolescents and adults. Many families are unable to cope with the emotional and physical demands for these individuals. In addition, the need for constant supervision is a financial burden for parents who need to remain at home. As an alternative to home care, residential group homes dedicated specifically to the care of individuals with PWS provide an environment with “food security”, enforce strict adherence to diet and exercise regimens, maintain rigid guidelines for managing behavioral disorders, and closely monitor health issues. Adults with PWS who live in dedicated group homes achieve and maintain significantly lower BMI values compared to age-matched controls living with their families at home: BMI (mean ± SD) decreased from 36.3 ± 11.0 kg/m<sup>2</sup> upon admission to 27.0 ± 5.6 kg/m<sup>2</sup> after seven years. The mean BMI was significantly lower in the group home residents (27.9 ± 7.1 kg/m<sup>2</sup>) compared to age-matched individuals living at home (36.8 ± 12.7 kg/m<sup>2</sup>, <italic toggle=""yes"">p</italic> = 0.008) [<xref rid=""B11-jcm-13-03323"" ref-type=""bibr"">11</xref>]. A recent survey of pooled international archival data showed that in people with PWS, there is a significant reduction in weight and BMI after joining a full-time care service, but the results were not compared with those of people with PWS living at home [<xref rid=""B12-jcm-13-03323"" ref-type=""bibr"">12</xref>]. Despite the proven health benefits of group home living, parents are often concerned about the effects of the highly structured environment on quality of life (QOL). There are, to date, only two studies addressing QOL in adults with PWS, one of which discussed the impact of weight and dysmorphic features on QOL, while the other addressed the influence of psychiatric disorders on QOL [<xref rid=""B13-jcm-13-03323"" ref-type=""bibr"">13</xref>,<xref rid=""B14-jcm-13-03323"" ref-type=""bibr"">14</xref>]. Neither of these reports compared the effect of residing in dedicated group homes on QOL with that of living in other settings. In the current study, we compared health, behavior, and overall QOL for adults with PWS living in PWS-specific hostels (SH) with those individuals residing at home with their families (H) or in non-specialized hostel settings (NSH).   This study is the first comprehensive comparison of QOL, physical health, and behavior for adults with PWS living in specialized hostels compared with PWS adults living at home or in non-specialized group homes. The two groups in our sample were similar in demographic data except for the expected differences in mean age (slightly higher in the SH group) and in mean BMI (lower in the SH group). We found that QOL is similar in both groups. Furthermore, QOL does not decrease with long-term living in the specialized group homes. Difficulties in coping with severe behavior problems were common reasons for families to decide to transition individuals to a PWS-specific group home environment. Therefore, it is not surprising that we found higher scores on oppositional behavior among SH residents. Nevertheless, the 8-year follow-up showed a significant reduction in food-seeking behaviors in the SH group. Because of the need for “food security” and to cope with characteristic behavior disorders of people with PWS, the hostels enforce a strict physical exercise regimen, caloric intake restriction, and assertive rules of conduct. Some parents are concerned that these policies and strict rules might have a negative impact on QOL. They claim that the staff in the SH may not relate to differences in personality traits and cognitive abilities among the various individuals with PWS and that living at home or in a less rigid hostel with a more heterogeneous population might allow better adaptation to the individual needs and personal abilities resulting in better QOL. Therefore, when parents are confronted with the decision whether or not to transition adolescents and adults with PWS to residential hostels, they wonder whether the improved physical health measures among SH residents may lead to a poorer QOL. We found that despite the strictly regulated behavioral environment, scores on the QOL questionnaires were not lower for the SH group compared to the H and NSH group. Compared with results of the same QOL questionnaire administered in 2013, the scores in the present study showed no significant change in QOL measures, indicating that long-term living in the designated group homes does not negatively impact QOL and that the significant improvements in health and behavior were not associated with deterioration in QOL. One of the main factors in PWS that interferes with usual social activities is the constant occupation in food seeking, which is an integral part of the PWS behavioral phenotype, including hoarding or foraging for food, eating inedible objects, and stealing food or stealing money to buy food [<xref rid=""B18-jcm-13-03323"" ref-type=""bibr"">18</xref>,<xref rid=""B19-jcm-13-03323"" ref-type=""bibr"">19</xref>]. Despite the fact that the SH group is characterized by more severe behavioral problems, we found that in our sample, living in an SH led to a reduction in negative food-seeking behaviors, and compared with results from the 2013 study, we found a decrease of 41.5% in negative food-seeking behavior in the SH group versus an increase of 22.7% in the H and NSH group. Since the individuals in the SH group are less occupied with food seeking, they are more able to enjoy the social life that the SH offers. A recent survey of pooled international archival data also found an improvement in behavior after joining a full-time care service but, unlike our study, did not compare with people with PWS of the same age living at home. In addition, behavior was measured by a non-standardized tool, QOL was not measured, and the follow-up period was only a year [<xref rid=""B12-jcm-13-03323"" ref-type=""bibr"">12</xref>]. The mean BMI in the SH group was 5.73 kg/m<sup>2</sup> lower than for the H and NSH group, consistent with the findings of Dudley et al. [<xref rid=""B20-jcm-13-03323"" ref-type=""bibr"">20</xref>] that living in an SH reduces the mean BMI by 3 kg/m<sup>2</sup> compared to living at home with both parents and by 6 kg/m<sup>2</sup> compared to living at home with a single parent. Furthermore, every year spent in a SH reduced the mean BMI by 0.57 kg/m<sup>2</sup>, as previously reported [<xref rid=""B11-jcm-13-03323"" ref-type=""bibr"">11</xref>]. In the QOL questionnaire, the findings show better results for the SH group in the physical domain of “Physical Functioning” (limitations in physical activities due to health problems) and no significant differences in all the other domains except for “General Health” (a subjective perception of the caregiver about the general health status), most likely due to their older age and more consistent monitoring of health issues. We also found that the SH group had lower cholesterol and triglyceride levels, higher vitamin D levels, and had a reduced risk of developing osteoporosis and osteopenia. There were no significant differences in other medical diagnoses compared with the H and NSH group, even though routine health surveillance including frequent laboratory tests was greater for the SH group. Earlier detection of medical conditions in the SH group may explain why other diagnoses were similar to findings in the H and NSH group, for whom other diagnoses may have been missed or delayed. Pellikaan et al. [<xref rid=""B21-jcm-13-03323"" ref-type=""bibr"">21</xref>] reported that the frequency of missed medical diagnoses for Dutch adults with PWS living in SH was lower: In the SH group, 39% had missed one diagnosis, 9% missed at least two diagnoses, and 9% missed three diagnoses or more compared to 61%, 24%, and 9%, respectively, in the adults living at home [<xref rid=""B21-jcm-13-03323"" ref-type=""bibr"">21</xref>]. Furthermore, the individuals living at home were younger than those in the SH group. We want to emphasize that there are some very important positive effects of living in an SH that are not assessed by standardized QOL questionnaires. SHs provide a social environment appropriate for the cognitive disabilities and behavior disorders of adults with PWS, including a full schedule of organized group activities. Within the SH group, there is a greater possibility to arrange employment tailored to the unique needs of adults with PWS. Due to experience with specific needs for individuals with PWS, counselors in the SH are able to find appropriate workplaces and arrange for chaperoned transportation to the places of employment and close supervision throughout the working hours. In most cases, parents of PWS adults lack the experience and resources for arranging employment in a sheltered workplace with a secured food environment. The size of our sample limits the scope of the statistical analysis. Nevertheless, this is a nation-wide sample that includes nearly all adults in the country with this rare syndrome. Another limitation is that the measurements of behavior, functioning, and QOL were recorded by parents for those living at home and by caregivers (who are hostel professionals) for those living in hostels. Despite the training that we gave for all of the participants on how to fill out the questionnaires, the approach of the caregivers to the subjective assessment of behavior and QOL may be different from that of the parents, which might have caused some bias in the comparison. Caregivers may tend to judge their patients more strictly and may try to compare several individuals whom they are rating. By contrast, parents may tend to be more sympathetic, and each parent rates only his/her daughter/son. Published studies on the agreement between parents’ and staff’s ratings of QOL or behavioral problems actually revealed discrepancies in several but not all domains [<xref rid=""B22-jcm-13-03323"" ref-type=""bibr"">22</xref>,<xref rid=""B23-jcm-13-03323"" ref-type=""bibr"">23</xref>]. Interestedly, one of the findings was that clinical researchers may be more attuned to some externalizing behaviors compared to parents [<xref rid=""B23-jcm-13-03323"" ref-type=""bibr"">23</xref>]. This observation may partly explain the observed phenomenon in our sample, where the SH group (assessed by group home staff) had higher mean score for oppositional behaviors compared to the H and NSH group (assessed by parents). QOL is similar in adults with PWS who live in specialized hostels, at home, or in non-specialized group homes. Individuals in SH have fewer food-seeking-related behaviors, one of the main factors affecting the behavior and management of individuals with PWS. They also have lower BMI, even though they are older and have more oppositional behavior. Our findings contradict the claim that the strict rules of SH negatively impact QOL. Furthermore, the benefits for social life and tailored employment are not apparent when evaluating the standardized QOL questionnaires. These findings may be helpful for families during the decision-making process for transitioning adolescents and adults with PWS to residential hostels. Further studies in different centers and countries are warranted in order to confirm these conclusions and to study potential cultural differences.",N/A,04 6 2024
Early onset stage III diabetic nephropathy in a child with Prader-Willi syndrome treated with dulaglutide: a case report,,"Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) is a genetic disorder caused by imprinting gene defects. Approximately 70% of cases are attributed to paternal deletion of the chromosomal region 15q11-13, while around 25% result from maternal uniparental disomy imprinting defects (<xref rid=""r1"" ref-type=""bibr"">1</xref>). PWS manifests with a variety of clinical features, including hyperphagia (excessive appetite), hypotonia (low muscle tone), intellectual disability, pituitary hormone deficiencies, and metabolic syndrome. Nearly 98% of PWS patients are overweight or obese (<xref rid=""r2"" ref-type=""bibr"">2</xref>). The mortality rate among individuals with PWS is approximately 3% per year, and it increases to around 7% per year for individuals over the age of 30. Obesity-related complications, including type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), arterial hypertension, sleep apnea, respiratory insufficiency, and cardiovascular disease, are the primary risk factors for mortality in individuals with PWS (<xref rid=""r3"" ref-type=""bibr"">3</xref>,<xref rid=""r4"" ref-type=""bibr"">4</xref>). Previous literature places the prevalence of T2DM in PWS at approximately 7–24% (<xref rid=""r5"" ref-type=""bibr"">5</xref>). However, it is extremely rare for PWS patients to develop diabetic nephropathy during childhood. Dulaglutide is a glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonist. Its mechanisms of action are augmentation of hyperglycemia-induced insulin secretion, suppression of glucagon secretion, deceleration of gastric emptying to prevent large post-meal glycemic increments, and a reduction in calorie intake and body weight (<xref rid=""r6"" ref-type=""bibr"">6</xref>-<xref rid=""r8"" ref-type=""bibr"">8</xref>). In this article, we report a case of a child with PWS complicated by stage III diabetic nephropathy. We describe the clinical presentation, diagnostic and treatment process, as well as the follow-up and prognosis of the patient. It plays an important role in the early diagnosis and treatment of diabetic nephropathy. We present this case in accordance with the CARE reporting checklist (available at <ext-link http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink href=""https://tp.amegroups.com/article/view/10.21037/tp-23-518/rc"" ext-link-type=""uri"">https://tp.amegroups.com/article/view/10.21037/tp-23-518/rc</ext-link>). A 10-year and 9-month-old male was admitted to the hospital due to the discovery of “elevated blood glucose with abnormal urine test results” for over 3 years. The patient’s weight was 68.3 kg (+3 standard deviation), height was 142 cm (−1 standard deviation), and body mass index (BMI) was 33.87 kg/m<sup>2</sup>. The patient had fair skin, light hair color, red rashes scattered on the face and back, a few pustules on the abdomen, a chubby facial appearance, a slightly narrow forehead, uneven ear positions (left ear higher than right ear), thin lips, a small chin, normal muscle strength and tone in the limbs, and relatively small hands and feet. There was no edema in the lower extremities. The patient had thickened breasts with slightly prominent areola and normal areola pigmentation. Testicular volume was 1 mL bilaterally, penis length was 3 cm, and no pubic or axillary hair was observed. The patient was the second born, delivered via full-term cesarean section. At birth, the patient was hospitalized due to “ABO hemolytic jaundice, ischemic-hypoxic encephalopathy, and feeding difficulties”. At the age of 3 months, the patient was diagnosed with hypotonia and received intermittent rehabilitation therapy until the age of 2. At the age of 3, the patient underwent surgery for undescended testicles. Three years ago, during a physical examination, elevated blood glucose levels (around 12 mmol/L) and 1+ urinary protein were discovered. The patient controlled the diet for 2 years, but body weight increased to 66 kg. In a follow-up examination at another hospital, the patient’s fasting blood glucose level was 17.87 mmol/L, triglycerides were 27.13 mmol/L, total cholesterol was 13.18 mmol/L, and urinary protein was 3+. The diagnosis was “type 2 diabetes, proteinuria, and hyperlipidemia”. The patient was treated with insulin, benapril, and atorvastatin. After 10 months of treatment, the patient’s fasting blood glucose level was 10.4 mmol/L, total cholesterol was 9.8 mmol/L, and urinary protein was 3+. He did not have autism spectrum disorder. The parent’s father had slightly elevated blood glucose levels (around 7.5 mmol/L). The mother and the patient’s sister had no history of diabetes, and there was no family history of similar conditions. Upon admission, the patient’s temperature and blood pressure were in the normal range (<xref rid=""f1"" ref-type=""fig""><italic toggle=""yes"">Figure 1</italic></xref>), his random blood glucose level was 13.6 mmol/L, fasting blood glucose level was 10.4 mmol/L, glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) was 8.9%, insulin level was 16.7 uIU/mL, C-peptide level was 2.51 ng/mL. Other laboratory findings included albumin level of 37.0 g/L, creatinine level of 41 µmol/L, triglycerides level of 7.64 mmol/L, and total cholesterol level of 5.18 mmol/L. The urine analysis revealed 3+ glucose, urinary albumin/creatinine ratio of 3,612.6 µg/mg. Urine tests for β2-microglobulin, blood complement, anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (ANCA), anti-glomerular basement membrane antibodies (GBM), and a complete rheumatologic panel showed no abnormalities. His oxytocin was not measured. Renal biopsy showed obvious mesangial matrix proliferation, Kimmelstiel-Wilson (K-W) nodules and mild mesangial cell proliferation in most of the glomerular glomus. It indicated stage III diabetic nephropathy (<xref rid=""f2"" ref-type=""fig""><italic toggle=""yes"">Figure 2</italic></xref>). Thrombosis and hyalinization were observed in small vessels in the renal interstitium. Genetic testing revealed a deletion of the SNRPN (NM_003097.5) gene fragment in the 15q11.2-q13 region. The average methylation level in the gene promoter region was 100%, indicating the loss of the paternal fragment (<xref rid=""f3"" ref-type=""fig""><italic toggle=""yes"">Figure 3</italic></xref>, <xref rid=""t1"" ref-type=""table""><italic toggle=""yes"">Table 1</italic></xref>). Based on the patient’s clinical manifestations, laboratory findings, pathological features, and genetic testing results, the patient is diagnosed with “Prader-Willi syndrome, type 2 diabetes, diabetic nephropathy, hyperlipidemia, and obesity”. The patient was treated with an angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) and dulaglutide (0.75 mg/week). After 8 months of treatment, the patient’s BMI, fasting blood glucose levels, and urinary protein levels showed improvement compared to before (BMI of 28 kg/m<sup>2</sup>, fasting blood glucose levels of 6.9–7.3 mmol/L, urinary albumin/creatinine ratio of 258 µg/mg), and glycated hemoglobin levels returned to normal. All procedures performed in this study were in accordance with the ethical standards of the Ethics Committee of Tongji Hospital (No. TJ-IRB20230702) and with the Helsinki Declaration (as revised in 2013). Informed consent was taken from the patient’s guardians for publication of this case report and accompanying images. A copy of the written consent is available for review by the editorial office of this journal. PWS is caused by a defect or deletion in the imprinting of genes in the 15q11.2-q13 region of chromosome 15. The syndrome is characterized by distinctive facial features, hypotonia (low muscle tone), feeding difficulties in early infancy, hypogonadism (reduced sexual function), delayed neurodevelopment, and compulsive overeating leading to morbid obesity (<xref rid=""r1"" ref-type=""bibr"">1</xref>,<xref rid=""r9"" ref-type=""bibr"">9</xref>). Individuals with PWS experience hyperphagia, lack of satiety, and low energy expenditure, leading to almost universal obesity in affected individuals. In this case, the patient’s BMI value was significantly elevated, indicating obesity. The average age of onset for diabetes in PWS patients is reported to be between 15.9 and 20.0 years (<xref rid=""r5"" ref-type=""bibr"">5</xref>,<xref rid=""r10"" ref-type=""bibr"">10</xref>). Adolescents with diabetes have a higher risk of renal failure and the need for dialysis compared to their non-diabetic peers of the same age (<xref rid=""r11"" ref-type=""bibr"">11</xref>-<xref rid=""r13"" ref-type=""bibr"">13</xref>). However, the progression to diabetic nephropathy usually takes time, and there are very few reports of children with PWS developing diabetic nephropathy. Our patient had elevated blood glucose with abnormal urine test results for over 3 years, and his renal biopsy after admission indicated stage III diabetic nephropathy. After reviewing the literature, no reports of PWS progressing to diabetic nephropathy in childhood have been found. This highlights the rarity of early-onset diabetic nephropathy in PWS children and underscores the importance of reporting this case. Dulaglutide, a GLP-1 receptor agonist, reduces ghrelin secretion, promotes insulin secretion, and increases the number and function of peripheral endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) in T2DM patients (<xref rid=""r6"" ref-type=""bibr"">6</xref>,<xref rid=""r7"" ref-type=""bibr"">7</xref>). EPCs, under specific conditions, can enter the peripheral blood circulation and differentiate into mature endothelial cells. They play a crucial role in promoting vascular formation and maintaining vascular homeostasis. The quantity and function of EPCs are highly correlated with cardiovascular risk factors and the development of atherosclerosis. Dulaglutide helps control blood glucose levels, decreases appetite, improves glucose metabolism, reduces inflammation, and maintains vascular homeostasis. Moreover, GLP-1 receptors are widely distributed, particularly in the renal glomeruli and proximal tubules, and have a direct regulatory effect on the kidneys. Therefore, GLP-1 receptor agonists provide renal protection while lowering blood glucose levels (<xref rid=""r14"" ref-type=""bibr"">14</xref>-<xref rid=""r17"" ref-type=""bibr"">17</xref>). The REWIND study showed that dulaglutide reduced the risk of composite renal endpoint events by 15% compared to placebo, and the risk of new-onset macroalbuminuria was significantly reduced by 23%. Adding a GLP-1 receptor agonist to insulin-based therapy not only achieves better glycemic control but also lowers the incidence of diabetic macroalbuminuria by reducing glomerular hyperfiltration in diabetes patients (<xref rid=""r18"" ref-type=""bibr"">18</xref>,<xref rid=""r19"" ref-type=""bibr"">19</xref>). The study has shown that dulaglutide has a good effect on the treatment of blood glucose control in youths with T2DM. Gastrointestinal symptoms were among the most common adverse events but were primarily mild and were most likely to occur soon after the initiation of therapy (<xref rid=""r20"" ref-type=""bibr"">20</xref>). Regarding clinical trials for PWS patients, Salehi <italic toggle=""yes"">et al.</italic> conducted a six-month study in 2016 to investigate the effects of exenatide (a GLP-1 receptor agonist) treatment. The study involved ten obese adult PWS patients and found that exenatide did not significantly affect body weight, BMI, or truncal obesity. However, a significant decrease in appetite scores and dietary behaviors was observed (<xref rid=""r21"" ref-type=""bibr"">21</xref>,<xref rid=""r22"" ref-type=""bibr"">22</xref>). Currently, there are no reports or clinical trials regarding the use of dulaglutide for PWS treatment. In this case, abnormal blood glucose and urinary protein were discovered in the patient at the age of 8, but renal biopsy was not performed initially. After insulin treatment, both blood glucose and urinary protein control remained poor. Subsequently, renal biopsy was performed, revealing stage III diabetic nephropathy. After initiating dulaglutide treatment, significant improvements in blood glucose and urinary protein were observed. This provides a new treatment perspective for PWS patients, especially those with concurrent kidney involvement. It is rare for patients to progress to diabetic nephropathy during childhood; however, in this case, the patient exhibited abnormal blood glucose and urinary protein at the age of 8, but further renal biopsy was not conducted to determine the extent of disease progression. For patients with issues in both blood glucose and urinary protein, it is advised to perform timely renal biopsy to facilitate early treatment, which holds great significance in improving patient prognosis. All PWS patients experience some degree of hypogonadism, with cryptorchidism occurring in 66–100% of newborn males. Most studies report normal onset of puberty in males; however, puberty arrest often coincides with testicular failure. Testicular volume can develop up to 6–7 mL but remains small in adulthood (<xref rid=""r23"" ref-type=""bibr"">23</xref>-<xref rid=""r26"" ref-type=""bibr"">26</xref>). In this case, the patient exhibited typical facial features, short stature, obesity, hypogonadism, and metabolic syndrome. Genetic testing confirmed the diagnosis of PWS. In conclusion, while focusing on controlling diabetes and urinary protein to prolong survival, we should also consider the patient’s psychological well-being and long-term quality of life. It is recommended that renal biopsy should be performed promptly if urinary protein is detected. Once the diagnosis of diabetic nephropathy is confirmed, GLP-1 agonists may be an alternative treatment method. This approach aims to prevent obesity and improve the long-term prognosis and quality of life for patients. The clinical features of PWS are complex and varied. And the renal biopsy should be performed promptly if urinary protein is detected in patients with PWS. In the paper, we provide a treatment idea for PWS patients with diabetic nephropathy, and GLP-1 agonists may be an alternative treatment method. ",N/A,21 5 2024
Metabolomic profiling of Prader-Willi syndrome compared with essential obesity,,"Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) is a rare disease, which shows a variable clinical phenotype, including muscle hypotonia and failure to thrive during infancy, short stature, intellectual disability, behavioral abnormalities, hyperphagia, and obesity in childhood and adulthood (<xref rid=""B1"" ref-type=""bibr"">1</xref>, <xref rid=""B2"" ref-type=""bibr"">2</xref>). Apart from growth hormone (GH) deficiency (GHD) (<xref rid=""B3"" ref-type=""bibr"">3</xref>), other endocrine diseases are frequently observed, including hypothyroidism and hypogonadism (<xref rid=""B4"" ref-type=""bibr"">4</xref>). PWS is due to some abnormality in the so-called Prader-Willi critical region (PWCR) at 15q11-q13. In particular, three main genetic patterns have been identified: paternal 15q11-q13 deletion (del15) (65-75% of cases), maternal uniparental disomy 15 (UPD15) (20-30% of cases), and imprinting center defect (1-3%) (<xref rid=""B5"" ref-type=""bibr"">5</xref>). Though clinical studies with conflicting results have been published, PWS-associated obesity exhibits clinical characteristics that are somewhat different from those of essential obesity (EOB), including body composition (particularly, adipose tissue), neuroendocrine system (e.g., ghrelin, oxytocin, and adiponectin), response to body weight reduction programs, occurrence of obesity-related comorbidities such as type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), and long-term cardiovascular prognosis (<xref rid=""B6"" ref-type=""bibr"">6</xref>–<xref rid=""B12"" ref-type=""bibr"">12</xref>). Evaluation of metabolome, i.e., the total of metabolites that, in the human organism, serve as substrates or by-products of enzymatic or non-enzymatic reactions, has become, in the last decade, a valuable tool to understand the biochemical pathways that are altered in patients affected by specific diseases. With the spread and technological improvements of -omics platforms, it is now possible to characterize the metabolomic profiling in manifold biofluids, including plasma and urine samples, which can be easily and repeatedly collected in any subject. This methodological approach is extremely attractive due to the potential diagnostic and/or therapeutic implications (<xref rid=""B13"" ref-type=""bibr"">13</xref>). Surprisingly, while a huge number of metabolomics-based clinical studies have been carried out in EOB (<xref rid=""B14"" ref-type=""bibr"">14</xref>), to the best of our knowledge, PWS has never been investigated by this innovative methodology so far. So, the aim of the present (case-control, retrospective) study was to compare the metabolomic profiles in patients with PWS vs. EOB. We hypothesized that a different metabolome, compared to EOB, could explain some aspects of the biochemistry and, so, the peculiar clinical phenotype in PWS.  Patients with PWS (F/M = 23/9; age: 31.6 ± 9.2 years; BMI: 42.1 ± 7.0 kg/m<sup>2</sup>) and with EOB (F/M = 23/9; age: 31.4 ± 6.9 years; BMI: 43.5 ± 3.5 kg/m<sup>2</sup>) were recruited, being the two groups comparable in terms of sex, age, BMI, and metabolic syndrome prevalence. <xref rid=""T1"" ref-type=""table"">
<bold>Table 1</bold>
</xref> reports descriptive statistics of demographic, biochemical, and clinical data referred to patients with PWS or EOB, including the corresponding inter-group comparisons. When considering body composition, patients with PWS exhibited lower FFM than those with EOB (p<0.0001), as well as a lower FM (p=0.0060), being similar the corresponding values expressed in percentage. REE was lower in patients with PWS than in those with EOB (p<0.0001), a difference that was missed after correcting the REE value by the subject’s FFM (i.e., energy efficiency). Though SBP and DBP were similar in both groups (PWS and EOB), without any difference in the percentages of subjects treated with antihypertensives, HR was lower in patients with PWS than in those with EOB (p<0.0001). When considering glucometabolic homeostasis, glycemia and insulinemia were, respectively, higher and lower in patients with PWS than in those with EOB (glucose: p=0.0052; insulin: =0.0019), though the percentage of the subjects treated with antidiabetic drugs was higher in the former than the latter ones (p=0.0389). Nevertheless, there were no differences in HOMA-IR and HbA1c when comparing the two groups (i.e., PWS vs. EOB). While there were no differences in T-C, LDL-C, and TG, HDL-C levels were higher in patients with PWS than in those with EOB (p=0,0186), being the two groups similarly treated with antilipidemic drugs.

</xref>, represents the box-plots referring to the distribution of the 28 metabolites associated with PWS (as described above). In the present study, the plasma metabolomic profile of adult patients with PWS has been determined in comparison with that of a control group, consisting of sex-, age- and BMI-matched subjects with EOB, being similar the prevalence of metabolic syndrome in both groups. When considering the results of a series of multivariable linear regressions, adjusted for some covariates such as sex, DBP, and CRP, plasma levels of many lysoPCs and PCs, together with those of some acylcarnitines and one SM, were shown to be associated with PWS (vs. non-PWS, i.e., EOB), with a FC ranging from 1.83 to 4.47, indicating higher levels of all metabolites in PWS than EOB group. To the best of our knowledge, no one has so far applied a metabolomic methodology to (biochemically) investigate the peculiar clinical phenotype in PWS compared to EOB. For the first time, in the limitations of our small patients’ sample, we have fundamentally documented an alteration in lipid metabolism, particularly the biochemical pathways of acylcarnitines and lysoPCs/PCs. Understanding the molecular mechanism(s) underlying metabolomics-derived biochemical results is not easy, but, in the present discussion, we would like to tentatively provide some explanations. As well-known, obesity is characterized by a lipid excess, with increased plasma non-esterified fatty acids (NEFAs), with ensuing lipid accumulation into different peripheral tissues, such as the liver and skeletal muscle (<xref rid=""B20"" ref-type=""bibr"">20</xref>, <xref rid=""B21"" ref-type=""bibr"">21</xref>). This deleterious process occurs not only as a result of increased NEFA availability, but also reduced FA oxidation (FAO) (<xref rid=""B22"" ref-type=""bibr"">22</xref>). Indeed, the rate of FAO, the so-called mitochondrial β-oxidation, has been reported to be reduced in the obese state, particularly during fasting (<xref rid=""B23"" ref-type=""bibr"">23</xref>). The proposed mechanism underlying this reduction is malonyl-CoA inhibition of carnitine-palmitoyl-transferase-1 (CPT1)-mediated entry of NEFA into mitochondria through acylcarnitine translocase (<xref rid=""B24"" ref-type=""bibr"">24</xref>). This molecular explanation is apparently congruent with our finding of increased C3-DC-acyl carnitine (i.e., malonylcarnitine), which would suggest an intracellular availability of malonyl-CoA. Anyway, as demonstrated by animal and human studies (<xref rid=""B25"" ref-type=""bibr"">25</xref>), in obesity there is an “intrinsic” decrease in mitochondrial FAO capacity rather than an acylcarnitines generation (<xref rid=""B26"" ref-type=""bibr"">26</xref>). In the present study, a general increase in plasma acylcarnitines levels was found in both EOB and PWS groups (when compared to the corresponding ranges in the normal-weight population) (<xref rid=""B17"" ref-type=""bibr"">17</xref>, <xref rid=""B27"" ref-type=""bibr"">27</xref>), suggesting an impairment in mitochondrial FAO capacity rather than CPT1 function. Furthermore, malonyl-CoA, an inhibitor of CPT1, has not the same biochemical role as malonylcarnitine (C3-DC-acylcarnitine), generated by CPT1. The acylcarnitine profile, as determined through our metabolomic approach, includes substrates of both fatty acid oxidation and amino acid β-oxidation (<xref rid=""B28"" ref-type=""bibr"">28</xref>). In particular, long-chain acylcarnitines, containing up to 20 carbons, accumulate in response to incomplete/inefficient FAO. In contrast, amino acid catabolism produces short-chain acylcarnitine species such as C3-acylcarnitine, C4-acylcarnitine, and C5-acylcarnitine. Importantly, the accumulation of medium- and short-chain acylcarnitines can also derive from the intermediate and ultimate steps (or rounds) of an incomplete/inefficient FAO (<xref rid=""B29"" ref-type=""bibr"">29</xref>). In the present study, differently from patients with EOB, increased levels of medium- (i.e., C10 and C14:1) and short-chain (i.e., C3-DC, C4-OH, and C5) acylcarnitines were found in the group of patients with PWS, suggesting a more incomplete/inefficient mitochondrial FAO, even in the intermediate/ultimate steps of the oxidative shortening of the acyl chain. To date, we are unable to explain the molecular reasons for this different impairment of FAO in EOB (initial steps of FAO) vs. PWS (intermediate/ultimate steps of FAO). In this regard, our patients with PWS had less FFM (kg) in comparison to patients with EOB (<xref rid=""B30"" ref-type=""bibr"">30</xref>, <xref rid=""B31"" ref-type=""bibr"">31</xref>). If FAO is predominantly carried out by skeletal muscle (<xref rid=""B32"" ref-type=""bibr"">32</xref>–<xref rid=""B34"" ref-type=""bibr"">34</xref>), the increased plasma short-chain acylcarnitines levels, found in our subjects with PWS, might depend on an incomplete/inefficient FAO related to a reduced amount of skeletal muscle (<xref rid=""B22"" ref-type=""bibr"">22</xref>). Reportedly, plasma levels of branched-chain amino acid (BCAA) and short-chain acylcarnitines are increased in the obese state, mainly due to a dysfunctional BCAA catabolic pathway (<xref rid=""B27"" ref-type=""bibr"">27</xref>, <xref rid=""B35"" ref-type=""bibr"">35</xref>). In particular, C5-acyl-CoA (i.e., isovaleryl-CoA) derives from leucine and isoleucine catabolism, from which C5-acylcarnitine (i.e., isovalerylcarnitine) is generated. In patients with PWS, a more evident sarcopenia has been documented due to GHD, hypogonadism, and muscle hypotonia (<xref rid=""B36"" ref-type=""bibr"">36</xref>), suggesting a skeletal muscle catabolic or anti-anabolic state that might represent another explanation for the higher short-chain acylcarnitines levels in patients with PWS than in those with EOB. Lecithin cholesterol acyl transferase (LCAT) is a plasma enzyme that esterifies cholesterol. This enzyme, primarily produced in the liver, is associated with specific lipoproteins, being the majority bound to HDL-C and, to a lesser extent, to LDL-C (<xref rid=""B37"" ref-type=""bibr"">37</xref>). LCAT has two different catalytic activities that account for its ability to esterify cholesterol: the first is a phospholipase A<sub>2</sub> activity, which cleaves FAs from the s<italic toggle=""yes"">n</italic>-2 position of PCs; the second is a transesterification activity, which transfers the cleaved FA to the hydroxyl group on the A-ring of cholesterol, with the production of a molecule of lysoPC. Apolipoprotein A-I (apoA-I), which is predominantly expressed in HDL-C, is an activating factor of LCAT by modifying the presentation of its lipid substrates. As cholesteryl esters are more hydrophobic than free cholesterol, cholesteryl esters formed by LCAT transfer from the surface of lipoproteins to the hydrophobic core. This process transforms the small pre-β-HDL (the so-called nascent HDL) into mature HDL (i.e., larger, spherical-shaped α-migrating particles) (<xref rid=""B38"" ref-type=""bibr"">38</xref>). Based on the metabolomic results obtained in the present study, the higher levels of lysoPCs and PCs are supposed to be related to an increase in (HDL-associated) LCAT activity in PWS than EOB. This putative explanation is congruent with the higher HDL-C levels in patients with PWS than in those with EOB. After its esterification by LCAT, cholesteryl esters on HDL can be transferred to apoB-containing lipoproteins (such as LDL) by cholesteryl ester transfer protein (CETP) (<xref rid=""B38"" ref-type=""bibr"">38</xref>). In the present study, though the statistical significance was not reached, LDL-C and T-C levels were higher in patients with PWS than in those with EOB. This finding might be an indirect consequence of LCAT hyperactivity, cholesteryl esters enriched HDL and enhanced CETP-mediated transfer of cholesteryl esters from HDL to LDL, with the ensuing increase in T-C levels. More difficult is to identify the causes of this (supposed) PWS-related LCAT hyperactivity (vs. EOB). These might be found among several factors recognized as specific for PWS compared to EOB, including abundance, distribution, and type of FM, the elevation of adiponectin and ghrelin and reduction of oxytocin and irisin levels, GHD, and impairment in the autonomic nervous system, all of which have been demonstrated to exert some effects on lipid metabolism (such as lysoPcs/PCs, NEFA, HDL-C, <italic toggle=""yes"">etc</italic>) (<xref rid=""B6"" ref-type=""bibr"">6</xref>–<xref rid=""B12"" ref-type=""bibr"">12</xref>). Based on the available information about the PWS patients recruited in the present study, apart from GHD and GH therapy, we cannot determine which factor(s) is of utmost importance, and what is the underlying mechanism(s) of PWS-specific metabolomic differences (vs. EOB) as above described. As known, SMs represent the major sphingolipid species in mammalian cells, concentrated in the outer leaflet of the plasma membrane (<xref rid=""B39"" ref-type=""bibr"">39</xref>). SM plays an important role in maintaining the function and integrity of lipid rafts, which are microdomains in the plasma membrane that are implicated in signal transduction (<xref rid=""B40"" ref-type=""bibr"">40</xref>, <xref rid=""B41"" ref-type=""bibr"">41</xref>). SM is synthesized from ceramide (Cer) and PC by sphingomyelin synthases (SMSs), for which two genes have been identified (i.e., SMS<sub>1</sub> and SMS<sub>2</sub>). Mammalian cells produce many species of SM (<xref rid=""B42"" ref-type=""bibr"">42</xref>, <xref rid=""B43"" ref-type=""bibr"">43</xref>). Liver SMS<sub>2</sub> is one of the determinants of plasma SM levels (<xref rid=""B44"" ref-type=""bibr"">44</xref>). Finally, high plasma SM levels have been associated with coronary artery disease, atherosclerosis, and obesity (<xref rid=""B45"" ref-type=""bibr"">45</xref>–<xref rid=""B49"" ref-type=""bibr"">49</xref>). Among several sphingoid metabolites that were measured in the plasma through our metabolomic approach, only one SM, precisely SM C22:2, was found to be associated with PWS (compared to EOB). We do not know why SM C22;2 levels were higher in patients with PWS than in those with EOB. The most plausible explanation is the general abundance of PCs in PWS compared to EOB, which, as described above, represent substrates for SMS<sub>2</sub>. Another hypothesis can be argued: as sphingolipids are known to elicit cellular inflammatory and specifically immune responses <italic toggle=""yes"">via</italic> many different molecular mechanisms (<xref rid=""B46"" ref-type=""bibr"">46</xref>, <xref rid=""B50"" ref-type=""bibr"">50</xref>), the distinctive alteration of SM metabolism might be the consequence (or the cause?) of that anomalous activation of the innate immune system that, in PWS, has been demonstrated to be independent from central adiposity and insulin resistance (<xref rid=""B51"" ref-type=""bibr"">51</xref>). In recent years, several studies have documented that PWS patients have lower insulinemia and insulin resistance than (BMI-matched) EOB controls, suggesting protected glucose metabolism (<xref rid=""B11"" ref-type=""bibr"">11</xref>). According to this view, the prevalence of impaired glucose intolerance, T2DM, or metabolic syndrome in PWS tends to be lower when compared to that in EOB controls (<xref rid=""B6"" ref-type=""bibr"">6</xref>, <xref rid=""B10"" ref-type=""bibr"">10</xref>, <xref rid=""B52"" ref-type=""bibr"">52</xref>). In the present study, PWS patients, though more treated with antidiabetic drugs, exhibited lower insulinemia in the context of hyperglycemia, when compared to the group with EOB. No other differences in T2DM biochemical markers, such as HOMA-IR and HbA1c, were found between the PWS and EOB groups. Our results seem to conflict with the commonly accepted view of a favorable glucometabolic homeostasis in PWS (vs. EOB) (<xref rid=""B11"" ref-type=""bibr"">11</xref>), but, due to the experimental design adopted for the present study, we were forced to strictly match the most relevant demographic, biochemical, and clinical characteristics between PWS and EOB groups, including the diagnosis of metabolic syndrome. This might have introduced an intrinsic (non-avoidable) bias. Furthermore, if abundance, distribution, and type of FM differ in PWS compared to EOB, BMI-matching might have minimized, as demonstrated by the present study and other ones, the typical insulin sensitivity in PWS. Being BMI (as well as FM/FFM) a “gross” parameter, only the use of sophisticated methods capable of evaluating the specific body fat patterning in PWS might solve this issue. In a recent study by Hou et al. (<xref rid=""B53"" ref-type=""bibr"">53</xref>), a serum lipidomics analysis was simultaneously explored in PWS, EOB, and normal-weight Chinese children. Results indicated that the total PCs and lysoPCs were deceased in PWS children compared with both EOB and normal-weight groups. In contrast, several SM, Cer, acylcarnitine, and TG species were increased. We do not know the reason(s) for the discrepancy between these results and those reported in our study. Age (children vs. adults), BMI (with higher values in our study), ethnicity (Asian vs. Caucasian), and selection of different gut microbial populations for diet and other environmental factors might be invoked. Before closing, apart from the limited sample size and the cross-sectional design, some other limitations of our study should be mentioned. First of all, we have determined only the metabolomic profiling in fasting conditions with no specific external interventions. In particular, metabolomic responses to exercise or weight loss might be different in PWS compared to EOB; thus, future studies are mandatory to investigate these research topics. Secondly, we have not determined microbial profiling in feces from any recruited subject. So, we cannot rule out that the changes in metabolite concentrations that were observed in the present study may be related to a different gut microbiota, capable of modifying the host’s metabolism or metabolite absorption from the gut in PWS compared to EOB. By using a metabolomic approach, patients with PWS, compared to those with EOB, exhibit higher plasma levels of specific metabolites belonging to some chemical classes, including manyfold lysoPCs/PCs, few (particularly, short-chain) acylcarnitines, and one SM, suggesting a different regulation of some biochemical pathways, fundamentally related to lipid metabolism. Deciphering the molecular mechanisms underlying the specific metabolomic profile might allow us to understand the peculiar clinical phenotype in patients with PWS (vs. those with EOB). Further studies are mandatory to translate these molecular data into more effective treatments and better clinical management of PWS.

"Deficiency in Prader-Willi syndrome gene <italic toggle=""yes"">necdin</italic> leads to attenuated cardiac contractility","Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) is a genetic disorder characterized by behavioral disturbances, hyperphagia, and intellectual disability. Several surveys indicate that PWS is also associated with cardiac abnormalities, possibly contributing to a high incidence of sudden death. However, the pathological mechanisms underlying cardiac dysfunction in PWS remain unclear. In this study, we found that deficiency in necdin, an intronless gene within PWS region, led to heart systolic and diastolic dysfunction in mice. Through yeast two-hybrid screening, we identified an interaction between necdin and non-muscle myosin regulatory light chain 12a/b (MYL12 A/B). We further showed that necdin stabilized MYL12 A/B via SGT1-heat shock protein 90 (HSP90) chaperone machinery. The zebrafish lacking the MYL12 A/B analog, MYL12.1, exhibited impaired heart function, while cardiac-specific overexpression of MYL12A normalized the heart dysfunction in necdin-deficient mice. Our findings revealed necdin dysfunction as a contributing factor to cardiomyopathy in PWS patients and emphasized the importance of HSP90 chaperone machinery and non-muscle myosin in heart fitness.  <list list-type=""simple"" id=""ulist0010""><list-item id=""u0010""><label>•</label><p id=""p0010"">Necdin deficiency resulted in heart dysfunction in mice</p></list-item><list-item id=""u0015""><label>•</label><p id=""p0015"">Necdin stabilized MYL12A through SGT1-HSP90 chaperone machinery</p></list-item><list-item id=""u0020""><label>•</label><p id=""p0020"">Cardiac-specific overexpression of MYL12A rescued the dysfunction in necdin-deficient mice</p></list-item></list> Cardiovascular medicine; Genetics; Molecular biology.","Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) is caused by loss of function in the paternally derived chromosome 15q11-q13,<xref rid=""bib1"" ref-type=""bibr""><sup>1</sup></xref> a maternally imprinted region.<xref rid=""bib2"" ref-type=""bibr""><sup>2</sup></xref> This region includes a few protein-coding genes (<italic toggle=""yes"">MKRN3</italic>, <italic toggle=""yes"">MAGEL2</italic>, <italic toggle=""yes"">NDN</italic>, <italic toggle=""yes"">SNRPN-SNURF</italic>, and <italic toggle=""yes"">C15orf2</italic>) and several noncoding RNA transcripts.<xref rid=""bib3"" ref-type=""bibr""><sup>3</sup></xref> PWS is a rare genetic disorder, with occurrence of 1/10,000 to 1/25,000 in the general population.

In order to further study the molecular mechanism, we used a yeast two-hybrid library screening system and found that necdin interacted with myosin regulatory light chain 12a (MYL12A), a non-muscle myosin regulatory light-chain protein. Additionally, we found that necdin interacted with SGT1/heat shock protein 90 (HSP90) chaperone machinery to stabilize MYL12A. Disruption of necdin or SGT1 expression destabilized MYL12A by promoting its degradation through the ubiquitin system. Importantly, MYL12.1 deficiency resulted in heart dysfunction in zebrafish, whereas <italic toggle=""yes"">trans</italic>-cardiac overexpression of MYL12A in <italic toggle=""yes"">necdin</italic>-deficient mice rescued the cardiac phenotypes.  In this study, we demonstrated that deficiency of necdin, a protein associated with PWS, led to heart dysfunction, characterized by decreased systolic amplitude and myocardial contraction rate. Mechanistically, necdin interacted with non-muscle MYL12A and stabilized MYL12A through SGT1-HSP90 chaperone machinery. A deficiency in necdin resulted in downregulation of MYL12A, whereas cardiac overexpression of MYL12A rescued the phenotype of attenuated cardiac contractility in <italic toggle=""yes"">necdin</italic>-deficient mice. Non-muscle myosin II (NMII) is a hexameric actin-binding protein that is formed of two heavy chains, two essential light chains, and two regulatory light chains (RLCs).<xref rid=""bib28"" ref-type=""bibr""><sup>28</sup></xref> Conformation and function of NMII are regulated by the phosphorylation of RLCs and the assembly dynamics of myosin filaments. NMII proteins are classified into three subfamilies (i.e., NMIIA, NMIIB, and NMIIC) according to the heavy-chain isoforms encoded by <italic toggle=""yes"">Myh9</italic>,<xref rid=""bib29"" ref-type=""bibr""><sup>29</sup></xref>

Mature cardiac myocytes only express NMIIB whereas non-myocytes in the heart express both NMIIA and NMIIB. Animal studies have suggested that NMIIs play critical roles in cardiac development. Mice deficient in Myh10 show severe cardiac dysplasia at an early developmental stage, and mice with a point mutation at a splice donor site in the <italic toggle=""yes"">Myh10</italic> gene display a phenotype with embryonic hydrocephalus and cardiac defects.<xref rid=""bib33"" ref-type=""bibr""><sup>33</sup></xref> Recently, Pandey et al. showed that PKC and non-muscle myosin are upregulated at the costameres in heart diseases, and activation of PKC leads to cardiomyocyte hypertrophy through activation of non-muscle myosin.<xref rid=""bib34"" ref-type=""bibr""><sup>34</sup></xref> Accumulated genetic studies also suggest the involvement of NMII in heart diseases. For instance, a point mutation in Myh10 impairs the crosslinkage of NMIIB to actin filaments, interfering with the dynamics of actomyosin cytoskeletal structure, and finally causes defects in heart development and body wall closure.<xref rid=""bib35"" ref-type=""bibr""><sup>35</sup></xref> There are three highly conserved non-muscle RLCs in mammals: MYL12A, MYL12B, and MYL9 (MYL12A/12B/9).<xref rid=""bib36"" ref-type=""bibr""><sup>36</sup></xref> Intriguingly, as one of the major non-muscle myosin RLCs, MYL12A has been associated with cardiovascular disease in a genome-wide association study.<xref rid=""bib26"" ref-type=""bibr""><sup>26</sup></xref> In the present study, we demonstrated that downregulation of the analog of MYL12A, MYL12.1, in zebrafish led to decreased systolic amplitude and myocardial contraction rate, further emphasizing the important role for non-muscle myosins in heart fitness. Although the NMII and its major RLCs MYL12A have been implicated in heart fitness through genetic studies and animal studies; however, the protein homeostasis processes involved in its regulation remain elusive. We recently demonstrated the interaction between necdin and SGT1, a HSP90 cochaperone protein.<xref rid=""bib37"" ref-type=""bibr""><sup>37</sup></xref> In this study, we identified MYL12 A/B as another interactive partner of necdin. Therefore, MYL12A/B-necdin-SGT1-HSP90 may form a complex to stabilize MYL12 A/B protein. Knockout of necdin disrupted this complex and destabilized MYL12 A/B, consequently compromising the function of NMII. HSP90 is a highly conserved and abundant ATP-dependent molecular chaperone. HSP90 functions in a wide variety of cellular processes by facilitating protein remodeling and activation of more than 200 client proteins.<xref rid=""bib38"" ref-type=""bibr""><sup>38</sup></xref> HSP90 has been generally considered to be cardioprotective, as its inhibitor increases cardiomyocyte apoptosis by downregulation of pro-survival Akt signaling and upregulation of pro-apoptotic p38α signaling. Cardiac-specific expression of HSP75, the mitochondrial HSP90 homolog, prevented cardiac hypertrophy and fibrosis induced by aortic banding, probably by inhibition of TAK/P38, JNK, and AKT signaling pathways.<xref rid=""bib39"" ref-type=""bibr""><sup>39</sup></xref> In isolated hearts, HSP90 has also been shown to guide the translocation of PKCε to mitochondria and reduce injury after ischemia/reperfusion insults.<xref rid=""bib40"" ref-type=""bibr""><sup>40</sup></xref> In endothelium, HSP90 plays an integral role in eNOS signaling, a pro-survival mechanism upon activation in cardiomyocytes.<xref rid=""bib41"" ref-type=""bibr""><sup>41</sup></xref> Furthermore, the cardioprotective effects of HSP90 may also be mediated by HAX-1 to inhibit IRE-1 signaling at the endoplasmic/sarcoplasmic reticulum level.<xref rid=""bib42"" ref-type=""bibr""><sup>42</sup></xref> In our study, we demonstrated that HSP90 may stabilize non-muscle myosin RLC MYL12A through necdin and SGT1. Disruption of necdin-SGT1-HSP90 leads to downregulation of MYL12A and reduced contractility of cardiomyocytes. In summary, our data uncovered an important role for PWS-associated necdin in heart fitness, which may underlie the heart dysfunction in PWS patients. It will be intriguing to study the role of necdin in the pathophysiology of cardiomyopathy induced by various conditions. ",N/A,14 5 2024

"Prader-Willi Syndrome: The More We Know, the Less We Know","Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) is a complex genetic neurodevelopmental disorder with multisystem impact and a unique behavior profile that evolves over the life span. Beyond the primary care needs of all children and adults, the unique medical concerns and management needs of those with PWS are best served in a multidisciplinary academic center. Our PWS center has provided care for individuals with PWS and their families since 1981. Our growth hormone studies contributed to growth hormone supplementation becoming standard of care in this country. Here, in collaboration with the primary care provider, early childhood intervention programs, schools and local parent organizations, solid, patient-centered care for affected individuals and their families can be provided across the life-span. The purpose of this article is to provide a brief overview of PWS and the attendant medical and behavior management challenges attendant to the disorder.",Full text not available in PMC,N/A,May-Jun 2024
Endocrine features of Prader-Willi syndrome: a narrative review focusing on genotype-phenotype correlation,"Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) is a complex genetic disorder caused by three different types of molecular genetic abnormalities. The most common defect is a deletion on the paternal 15q11-q13 chromosome, which is seen in about 60% of individuals. The next most common abnormality is maternal disomy 15, found in around 35% of cases, and a defect in the imprinting center that controls the activity of certain genes on chromosome 15, seen in 1-3% of cases. Individuals with PWS typically experience issues with the hypothalamic-pituitary axis, leading to excessive hunger (hyperphagia), severe obesity, various endocrine disorders, and intellectual disability. Differences in physical and behavioral characteristics between patients with PWS due to deletion versus those with maternal disomy are discussed in literature. Patients with maternal disomy tend to have more frequent neurodevelopmental problems, such as autistic traits and behavioral issues, and generally have higher IQ levels compared to those with deletion of the critical PWS region. This has led us to review the pertinent literature to investigate the possibility of establishing connections between the genetic abnormalities and the endocrine disorders experienced by PWS patients, in order to develop more targeted diagnostic and treatment protocols. In this review, we will review the current state of clinical studies focusing on endocrine disorders in individuals with PWS patients, with a specific focus on the various genetic causes. We will look at topics such as neonatal anthropometry, thyroid issues, adrenal problems, hypogonadism, bone metabolism abnormalities, metabolic syndrome resulting from severe obesity caused by hyperphagia, deficiencies in the GH/IGF-1 axis, and the corresponding responses to treatment.","Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS; MIM: 176270) is a rare and complex progressive disorder that affects multiple body systems, and is recognized as one of the most common causes of genetic obesity. It occurs in approximately 1 in 20,000-30,000 live births (<xref rid=""B1"" ref-type=""bibr"">1</xref>, <xref rid=""B2"" ref-type=""bibr"">2</xref>), with an equal number of males and females affected. Genotype-phenotype correlation is a relationship that examines how the presence of a clinical trait corresponds with a group of similar mutations. However, this correlation is reliant on accurate phenotyping. Studying genotype-phenotype correlations can offer insights into disease development, progression, severity, and activity, ultimately aiding clinicians in tailoring treatment plans and follow-up care. Pathways from genotype to phenotype in PWS are difficult to explain. So far, no genotype has been linked to any exclusive symptoms. The aim of this literature review is to describe and discuss the endocrine and metabolic issues underlying PWS, emphasizing potential genotype-phenotype correlations to assist healthcare professionals in their practice and to guide future research endeavors, in order to provide some benefit to people with the syndrome and their families. Manuscripts were included after conducting a search on PubMed, Directory of Open Access Journals and Google Scholar using the keyword “Prader-Willi syndrome” and the keyword for each specific section (for instance “thyroid” or “growth hormone” etc.). Only manuscripts written in English were considered. We excluded review paper, and non-original research articles. Furthermore, additional papers were included if they were known to the authors of this review, even if they were not retrieved by the search. Finally, the references of relevant articles were screened. Delayed diagnosis of PWS may be partially due to a lack of timely recognition of perinatal and/or neonatal features. In fact, during the perinatal and neonatal period, PWS is often associated with a higher prevalence of labor induction, breech presentation, cesarean delivery, preterm or post-term delivery, low birthweight, and small for gestational age (SGA) newborns compared to the general pediatric population (<xref rid=""B19"" ref-type=""bibr"">19</xref>, <xref rid=""B24"" ref-type=""bibr"">24</xref>). Pregnancy-related complications, such as polyhydramnios from reduced fetal swallowing causing uterine distension (<xref rid=""B19"" ref-type=""bibr"">19</xref>) and/or placental abnormalities due to the lack of beneficial influence of paternal genes (<xref rid=""B25"" ref-type=""bibr"">25</xref>, <xref rid=""B26"" ref-type=""bibr"">26</xref>), have been suggested to explain preterm labor and SGA, respectively. Birth weight and weight-for-length of newborns with PWS are reduced by approximately 500 grams (<xref rid=""B27"" ref-type=""bibr"">27</xref>). Regarding birth length, the results from the literature are still inconclusive, with some studies reporting values comparable to healthy controls (<xref rid=""B26"" ref-type=""bibr"">26</xref>, <xref rid=""B28"" ref-type=""bibr"">28</xref>), and others reporting values 1-2 cm shorter than normal (<xref rid=""B24"" ref-type=""bibr"">24</xref>, <xref rid=""B27"" ref-type=""bibr"">27</xref>). Occipito-frontal circumference was found to be within normal ranges compared to the general population at birth (<xref rid=""B24"" ref-type=""bibr"">24</xref>, <xref rid=""B27"" ref-type=""bibr"">27</xref>), as well as over the first year of life (<xref rid=""B29"" ref-type=""bibr"">29</xref>). A recent nationwide multicenter study provided growth charts of birth weight and length for gestational age specific for PWS (<xref rid=""B27"" ref-type=""bibr"">27</xref>), which may serve as a useful tool in supporting the suspicion of PWS in newborns. To date, only a few studies have examined potential links between perinatal characteristics and the specific genotype of PWS, resulting in conflicting findings. The differences in the prevalence of preterm births among different genotypes remain uncertain, as some researches have reported similar rates between mUPD and del15q (<xref rid=""B24"" ref-type=""bibr"">24</xref>, <xref rid=""B26"" ref-type=""bibr"">26</xref>, <xref rid=""B30"" ref-type=""bibr"">30</xref>, <xref rid=""B31"" ref-type=""bibr"">31</xref>), while others have found a higher prevalence in mUPD individuals (<xref rid=""B32"" ref-type=""bibr"">32</xref>, <xref rid=""B33"" ref-type=""bibr"">33</xref>) or, conversely, in those carrying del15q (<xref rid=""B19"" ref-type=""bibr"">19</xref>). Additionally, mUPD has been linked to a greater likelihood of post-term births (<xref rid=""B32"" ref-type=""bibr"">32</xref>). Most studies have not identified differences in birth weight among specific genotype groups (<xref rid=""B26"" ref-type=""bibr"">26</xref>, <xref rid=""B27"" ref-type=""bibr"">27</xref>, <xref rid=""B31"" ref-type=""bibr"">31</xref>, <xref rid=""B34"" ref-type=""bibr"">34</xref>). However, Dudley et al. discovered lower birth weight only in the del15q group, irrespective of gender (<xref rid=""B28"" ref-type=""bibr"">28</xref>). On the other hand, the prevalence of SGA was significantly higher in mUPD carriers compared to patients with del15q or imprinting center defects, with a prevalence rate of 31%, roughly twice as high as in the other two genotype groups (<xref rid=""B24"" ref-type=""bibr"">24</xref>). Furthermore, several studies have indicated a correlation between parental weight (<xref rid=""B28"" ref-type=""bibr"">28</xref>) or maternal age (<xref rid=""B24"" ref-type=""bibr"">24</xref>, <xref rid=""B26"" ref-type=""bibr"">26</xref>) and birth weight specifically in PWS patients with mUPD or imprinting center defects. Regarding birth length, a large cohort study (<xref rid=""B27"" ref-type=""bibr"">27</xref>) found a significant decrease only in females with del15q compared to those with mUPD, with no clear genotype-phenotype correlation observed for male neonatal size. These results contradict those reported by Whittington et al. (<xref rid=""B26"" ref-type=""bibr"">26</xref>), who found lower birth length values only in patients with mUPD or imprinting center defects, who were also shorter than patients with the del15q. Thyroid function in PWS has been extensively studied, and, like other endocrine disorders, its cause is believed to be centrally located in origin due to a dysregulated hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid (HPT) axis. In PWS, central hypothyroidism (CH) is the most common thyroid function abnormality, with a prevalence ranging from 2% to 72.2% globally (<xref rid=""B35"" ref-type=""bibr"">35</xref>, <xref rid=""B36"" ref-type=""bibr"">36</xref>) and varying age of onset (<xref rid=""SM1"" ref-type=""supplementary-material"">
<bold>Supplementary Table 1</bold>
</xref>). Screening for hypothyroidism in newborns with PWS often produces negative results, as their levels of TSH and total T4 are typically within the normal range and comparable to those of healthy individuals (<xref rid=""B37"" ref-type=""bibr"">37</xref>). However, there have been a few cases of congenital hypothyroidism in PWS newborns due to an ectopic thyroid gland (<xref rid=""B38"" ref-type=""bibr"">38</xref>, <xref rid=""B39"" ref-type=""bibr"">39</xref>). Congenital hypothyroidism appears to be more common in infants and toddlers with PWS, with the highest incidence in the 1 to 3-year-old group, gradually decreasing over time (<xref rid=""B40"" ref-type=""bibr"">40</xref>), likely due to a temporary dysfunction of the hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid axis (<xref rid=""B41"" ref-type=""bibr"">41</xref>, <xref rid=""B42"" ref-type=""bibr"">42</xref>). During this phase, treatment with levothyroxine may be necessary if there is a simultaneous decrease in free T4 (fT4) and free T3 (fT3) levels, or an increase in TSH levels, to prevent significant impacts on intellectual development (<xref rid=""B43"" ref-type=""bibr"">43</xref>, <xref rid=""B44"" ref-type=""bibr"">44</xref>). In later stages of life, thyroid function may normalize, even in individuals who were previously treated with levothyroxine (<xref rid=""B44"" ref-type=""bibr"">44</xref>). It is recommended that adults with PWS undergo regular and periodic screening of fT4 and TSH levels, as untreated hypothyroidism can have adverse effects on metabolic rate, body mass index, and cardiovascular health (<xref rid=""B45"" ref-type=""bibr"">45</xref>). The influence of sex on thyroid status and whether genotype could be associated with a different pattern of thyroid function still remains unclear. Regarding genotype, the prevalence of CH in children with PWS was not significantly different among the paternal deletion, mUPD, and unclassified groups (<xref rid=""B40"" ref-type=""bibr"">40</xref>). Similarly, no relationship between hypothyroidism and genotype was found in a cohort of 122 adults with PWS (<xref rid=""B45"" ref-type=""bibr"">45</xref>). Recent studies have shown that there are no significant differences in the prevalence of CH between the sexes (<xref rid=""B42"" ref-type=""bibr"">42</xref>), although previous works observed that CH was more common in males with PWS (<xref rid=""B41"" ref-type=""bibr"">41</xref>). The relationship between thyroid function and recombinant human (rhGH) therapy, particularly the influence of rhGH on serum thyroid hormone levels and increased conversion of thyroxine (T4) to triiodothyronine (T3), has been evaluated in some studies (<xref rid=""B41"" ref-type=""bibr"">41</xref>, <xref rid=""B46"" ref-type=""bibr"">46</xref>). RhGH therapy does not seem to increase the prevalence of different forms of hypothyroidism in PWS (<xref rid=""B41"" ref-type=""bibr"">41</xref>, <xref rid=""B46"" ref-type=""bibr"">46</xref>), but it is important to evaluate thyroid hormones before, during, and after rhGH treatment to confirm euthyroidism and prevent the possible risks of previously unmasked and/or untreated hypothyroidism. The autoimmune cause of impaired thyroid function has never been described or studied in patients with PWS. Thyroid autoantibodies are rarely measured in PWS patients, likely due to the well-known central origin of hypothyroidism. Only one study, which evaluated 21 PWS children, reported a case of mild positivity for anti-thyroid peroxidase antibodies (<xref rid=""B39"" ref-type=""bibr"">39</xref>). However, the possibility of autoimmune thyroid involvement could be considered, given the recently proposed autoimmune cause of pituitary dysfunction associated with PWS (<xref rid=""B47"" ref-type=""bibr"">47</xref>, <xref rid=""B48"" ref-type=""bibr"">48</xref>). Further research is needed to clarify this issue. Regarding hyperthyroidism, a single case with an unclear origin treated with thiamazole was reported in a group of adult patients with PWS (<xref rid=""B45"" ref-type=""bibr"">45</xref>). It is important to regularly monitor the thyroid function of PWS patients at different stages of life, taking into account factors such as levothyroxine treatment, rhGH therapy, and the emergence of new symptoms of hypothyroidism. Based on the data available in the literature, there does not appear to be a clear correlation between genotype and thyroid dysfunction in individuals with PWS. Yang et al. (<xref rid=""B42"" ref-type=""bibr"">42</xref>) found that infants with PWS caused by mUPD had higher TSH levels compared to those with PWS caused by a paternal 15q11-q13 deletion, even though the TSH levels were still within the normal range. Additionally, there were no differences in fT3 and fT4 levels between these two groups. Conversely, in adults with PWS caused by a 15q11-q13 deletion, TSH levels within the normal range were higher than in PWS individuals with mUPD. Again, no differences in fT3 and fT4 levels were found between the groups (<xref rid=""B45"" ref-type=""bibr"">45</xref>). Therefore, further evaluation will be necessary to determine if there is a possible correlation between genotype and the different patterns of thyroid dysfunction. Disturbances in the hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis, with an inadequate response during stressful conditions like infections or episodes of dehydration, have been suggested as potential causes of unexpected and unexplained deaths in PWS. This theory is supported by the discovery of adrenal atrophy upon autopsy (<xref rid=""B49"" ref-type=""bibr"">49</xref>) and reduced cell numbers in the hypothalamic paraventricular nuclei (<xref rid=""B50"" ref-type=""bibr"">50</xref>). CAI in PWS is not well understood, as studies have reported varying results (ranging from 0% to 60%) using different dynamic tests, such as the insulin tolerance test (ITT), metyrapone test (MT), glucagon test (GT), and the currently most used low-dose and standard dose Synacthen stimulation test (LDSST and SDSST) (<xref rid=""T1"" ref-type=""table"">
<bold>Table 1</bold>
</xref>) (<xref rid=""B51"" ref-type=""bibr"">51</xref>–<xref rid=""B62"" ref-type=""bibr"">62</xref>). Based on early data that show a high prevalence of CAI (<xref rid=""B56"" ref-type=""bibr"">56</xref>, <xref rid=""B56"" ref-type=""bibr"">56</xref>), some authors have suggested that all patients with PWS should be treated empirically with hydrocortisone during stressful situations unless CAI has been ruled out. The high prevalence reported in these studies, however, could be related to the use of ACTH levels for the diagnosis of CAI, rather than 11-deoxycortisol, and the high cut-off used (33 pmol/l) (<xref rid=""B54"" ref-type=""bibr"">54</xref>, <xref rid=""B57"" ref-type=""bibr"">57</xref>, <xref rid=""B61"" ref-type=""bibr"">61</xref>). More recent studies, using 11-deoxycortisol or a lower cut-off of ACTH after MT or other dynamic tests, reported a much lower prevalence (<xref rid=""B52"" ref-type=""bibr"">52</xref>–<xref rid=""B55"" ref-type=""bibr"">55</xref>, <xref rid=""B57"" ref-type=""bibr"">57</xref>–<xref rid=""B62"" ref-type=""bibr"">62</xref>). Based on this low CAI prevalence, several authors advised against routine administration of hydrocortisone during psychological stress, illness, or surgery (<xref rid=""B61"" ref-type=""bibr"">61</xref>) to avoid excessive treatment. Additionally, reports of adrenal crisis during surgery are currently only anecdotal (<xref rid=""B63"" ref-type=""bibr"">63</xref>). Other reports by Oto et al. (<xref rid=""B55"" ref-type=""bibr"">55</xref>) and Grootjen et al. (<xref rid=""B62"" ref-type=""bibr"">62</xref>) have shown a delayed peak of cortisol after ITT, ACTH and 11-deoxycortisol after MT. The literature data generally supports the evidence that individuals with PWS in common clinical practice do not typically experience adrenal insufficiency, are not usually treated with daily glucocorticoids, and do not generally experience adrenal crises during surgery or other stressful procedures and events. Currently, there is no consensus among endocrinologists on the best diagnostic approach, management, or need for empiric glucocorticoid treatment during critical illness or before surgery. Regarding the genotype-phenotype correlation, it is currently not possible to define a clear correlation, as evaluated by a small number of authors so far. de Lind van Wijngaarden et al. (<xref rid=""B51"" ref-type=""bibr"">51</xref>) found no significant differences in genotype between pediatric patients with and without CAI diagnosed by MT, while Corrias et al. (<xref rid=""B52"" ref-type=""bibr"">52</xref>) reported a significantly lower cortisol peak after LDSST in children with del15q compared to mUPD, a genetic subclass identified as a predictor of the peak response. However, this result with LDSST was not confirmed by Obrynba et al. in children (<xref rid=""B54"" ref-type=""bibr"">54</xref>) or by Grugni et al. in adults (<xref rid=""B53"" ref-type=""bibr"">53</xref>). Oto et al. (<xref rid=""B55"" ref-type=""bibr"">55</xref>) did indicate a delayed cortisol peak response after ITT in del15q compared to mUPD. Regarding basal cortisol, children with PWS are generally able to produce adequate levels in daily life, as demonstrated by studies showing normal average morning basal serum cortisol (<xref rid=""B64"" ref-type=""bibr"">64</xref>–<xref rid=""B66"" ref-type=""bibr"">66</xref>) or salivary cortisol (<xref rid=""B51"" ref-type=""bibr"">51</xref>). Lower values of morning basal cortisol, although within the normal range compared to the general population, were reported in a large cohort of PWS children by Angulo et al. (<xref rid=""B64"" ref-type=""bibr"">64</xref>), but not by Beaulove et al. (<xref rid=""B60"" ref-type=""bibr"">60</xref>) and Oto et al. (<xref rid=""B55"" ref-type=""bibr"">55</xref>), nor by Butler et al. in a population of adults and children with PWS compared to a control group with non-syndromic obesity (<xref rid=""B65"" ref-type=""bibr"">65</xref>). Angulo et al. and Butler et al. (<xref rid=""B64"" ref-type=""bibr"">64</xref>, <xref rid=""B65"" ref-type=""bibr"">65</xref>) found no correlation between morning basal cortisol and specific genetic subtypes. Based on the literature review, primary adrenal insufficiency (PAI) has not been reported in PWS patients. Another issue regarding adrenal function in PWS is the presence of premature pubarche, reported in the literature with a very variable prevalence, from 14% to 60% (<xref rid=""B66"" ref-type=""bibr"">66</xref>–<xref rid=""B73"" ref-type=""bibr"">73</xref>). Siemensma et al. (<xref rid=""B67"" ref-type=""bibr"">67</xref>) and Gaston et al. (<xref rid=""B70"" ref-type=""bibr"">70</xref>) found no significant differences in the proportion of patients with premature pubarche in subjects with different genetic subtypes. Increased plasma levels of DHEA-S have been reported in children with PWS compared to the healthy pediatric population, with no associations between DHEA-S levels and BMI or percentage of fat (<xref rid=""B66"" ref-type=""bibr"">66</xref>–<xref rid=""B68"" ref-type=""bibr"">68</xref>). Finally, Siemensma et al. (<xref rid=""B67"" ref-type=""bibr"">67</xref>) showed no significant differences in DHEA-S levels between genetic subtypes in children, while Gaston et al. (<xref rid=""B70"" ref-type=""bibr"">70</xref>) reported the highest DHEA-S levels in patients with del15q. Individuals with PWS typically have a bone structure characterized by short stature, low bone mineral density (BMD), and low bone mineral content (BMC) (<xref rid=""B74"" ref-type=""bibr"">74</xref>), often leading to orthopedic issues such as scoliosis, kyphosis, hip dysplasia, flat feet, and genu valgum (<xref rid=""B75"" ref-type=""bibr"">75</xref>, <xref rid=""B76"" ref-type=""bibr"">76</xref>). The process of bone formation is continuous throughout life, and the acquisition of bone minerals in early childhood is crucial for achieving optimal BMD levels in late adolescence. Bone health is influenced by the interaction between osteoblasts (bone forming cells, OBs) and osteoclasts (bone resorbing cells, OCs), which are primarily regulated by the Wnt/β-catenin pathway and the receptor activator of nuclear factor-κB (RANK)/RANK ligand (RANKL)/osteoprotegerin (OPG) axis, respectively (<xref rid=""B74"" ref-type=""bibr"">74</xref>). In childhood, individuals with PWS often have normal BMD levels when adjusted for their reduced height (<xref rid=""B77"" ref-type=""bibr"">77</xref>), but during adolescence, they may experience a decrease in total BMD and BMC. As a result, it is estimated that 29% to 44% of adults with PWS may suffer from bone fractures due to the higher prevalence of osteoporosis, reported to be as high as 21% (<xref rid=""B78"" ref-type=""bibr"">78</xref>). The factors contributing to bone impairment in individuals with PWS are not fully understood, but possible explanations include loss of function of genes in the q11-q13 region of the paternal copy of chromosome 15, reduced production of sex hormones during puberty, as well as a relative GHD during childhood and adolescence (<xref rid=""B5"" ref-type=""bibr"">5</xref>). Additionally, low calcium intake, insufficient levels of vitamin D, lack of physical activity, and changes in serum adipokines may also play a role in bone impairment in these individuals (<xref rid=""B79"" ref-type=""bibr"">79</xref>). Regarding the genes in the PWS critical domain that are involved in skeletal abnormalities, deletion of Snord116 has been shown to have negative effects specifically on the bone cortical compartment (<xref rid=""B80"" ref-type=""bibr"">80</xref>). Deletion of <italic toggle=""yes"">MAGEL2</italic> is linked to Schaaf-Yang syndrome, which is characterized by a unique skeletal phenotype with abnormal BMD due to increased OCs activity and enhanced transformation of OBs into adipocytes (<xref rid=""B81"" ref-type=""bibr"">81</xref>). <italic toggle=""yes"">MAGEL2</italic> deletion is also associated with decreased levels of N-oleoyl serine, which has a positive correlation with BMD and OBs activity (<xref rid=""B82"" ref-type=""bibr"">82</xref>). Hypogonadism is a common feature in individuals with PWS. This condition is a well-recognized risk factor for osteoporosis, and it is important to start hormone replacement therapy (HRT) in a timely manner to prevent bone loss (<xref rid=""B78"" ref-type=""bibr"">78</xref>). A cohort study of 22 PWS patients showed a significant improvement in BMD and lean body mass after starting HRT (<xref rid=""B83"" ref-type=""bibr"">83</xref>). Another study found that individuals with PWS who received HRT had higher BMD compared to those who were not treated (<xref rid=""B84"" ref-type=""bibr"">84</xref>). Therefore, it is recommended that individuals with PWS start HRT as soon as hypogonadism is identified. There is limited data on the effects of rhGH treatment on BMD in individuals with PWS. A study by Bakker et al. (<xref rid=""B85"" ref-type=""bibr"">85</xref>) found that total body BMD and lumbar spine BMD remained stable in prepubertal PWS children during 9 years of GH therapy, but decreased during adolescence due to incomplete pubertal development, emphasizing the importance of prompt replacement therapy. In a group of adult PWS subjects, GH treatment for 2 years did not effectively improve low bone mass (<xref rid=""B86"" ref-type=""bibr"">86</xref>). However, there are conflicting findings on the effects of GH therapy on BMD in PWS, as some studies have shown that GH administration in PWS adults has a positive effect on bone mineralization and geometry (<xref rid=""B87"" ref-type=""bibr"">87</xref>). Nakamura et al. (<xref rid=""B88"" ref-type=""bibr"">88</xref>) reported a low BMD in 61.5% of subjects with PWS, with an improvement in lumbar BMD Z-score after more than 4 years of GH administration. Additionally, a higher incidence of osteoporosis was found among PWS adults who did not receive GH therapy during adolescence (<xref rid=""B88"" ref-type=""bibr"">88</xref>). Data on vitamin D levels in individuals with PWS are still limited and inconclusive. Panfili et al. (<xref rid=""B89"" ref-type=""bibr"">89</xref>) studied a group of pediatric PWS patients and did not find any significant differences between PWS children and the control group, although there was a slight decrease in obese PWS individuals compared to those of normal weight. In contrast, Barrea et al. discovered that adults with PWS had lower levels of vitamin D compared to the control group, regardless of differences in body fat (<xref rid=""B90"" ref-type=""bibr"">90</xref>). Brunetti et al. demonstrated the involvement of the Wnt/β-catenin and RANK/RANKL/(OPG) axis in PWS by showing high levels of RANK-L and low levels of OPG in both children and adults with PWS, with a bias towards RANK-L (<xref rid=""B91"" ref-type=""bibr"">91</xref>). Additionally, sclerostin levels were significantly higher in children and lower in adults with PWS compared to controls, indicating that RANK-L, OPG, and sclerostin may play a crucial role in regulating bone turnover in individuals with PWS. Recently, irisin, a myokine secreted by the muscle, has sparked great interest due to its involvement in bone, adipose tissue, and brain homeostasis. Specifically, in young mice, irisin injection mimicked the effects of exercise by increasing cortical bone mass and strength (<xref rid=""B92"" ref-type=""bibr"">92</xref>). Hirsch et al. found higher amounts of salivary irisin in obese individuals with PWS compared to non-obese controls, while plasma levels of irisin did not show significant changes between the two groups (<xref rid=""B93"" ref-type=""bibr"">93</xref>, <xref rid=""B94"" ref-type=""bibr"">94</xref>). Faienza et al. demonstrated that irisin serum levels in PWS patients were similar to those of controls (<xref rid=""B95"" ref-type=""bibr"">95</xref>), however, both pediatric and adult PWS subjects with del15q had lower irisin levels compared to controls, whereas no difference was observed between PWS subjects with mUPD and healthy controls. LIGHT/TNFSF14 is a cytokine produced by immune cells that affects both fat and bone metabolism; Faienza et al. showed that serum LIGHT levels were significantly higher in both PWS children and PWS adults than in controls (<xref rid=""B96"" ref-type=""bibr"">96</xref>). Additionally, LIGHT levels were found to have a negative correlation with DEXA parameters. LIGHT serum levels were influenced by various factors including vitamin D and DXA parameters related to bone and fat quality, indicating the important role of LIGHT as a marker of bone impairment.

</xref> summarizes the most important studies about bone metabolism in PWS. Impaired growth is a common feature of PWS, attributed to a lack of GH/IGF-1 and a lack of pubertal growth spurt. Infants with PWS also show other clinical signs of GHD, such as low muscle tone, small hands and feet, increased body fat percentage, and reduced lean mass. GHD is documented in 40-100% of children with PWS, although the severity can vary from mild to severe (<xref rid=""B98"" ref-type=""bibr"">98</xref>–<xref rid=""B100"" ref-type=""bibr"">100</xref>). Without rhGH replacement therapy, the average final height for men is reported to be 155-160 cm, and for women, it is 145-150 cm (<xref rid=""B101"" ref-type=""bibr"">101</xref>). The cause of impaired GH secretion in PWS is still being debated, mainly because early childhood-onset obesity is so common in this population. It is widely recognized that obese individuals who are otherwise healthy tend to have lower GH secretion compared to lean individuals. Obesity typically leads to changes in the IGF system, resulting in lower IGF-1 availability. However, most studies show that the total measured circulating IGF-1 levels in obese individuals are normal or even elevated (<xref rid=""B102"" ref-type=""bibr"">102</xref>). In individuals with PWS, IGF-1 levels are often reported to be low in many studies, regardless of BMI, indicating a GHD. Additionally, levels of IGFBP-3, a protein that binds to IGF-1, are also found to be low in PWS (<xref rid=""B99"" ref-type=""bibr"">99</xref>, <xref rid=""B103"" ref-type=""bibr"">103</xref>, <xref rid=""B104"" ref-type=""bibr"">104</xref>). Unfortunately, research on the IGF system in PWS has been limited overall. The GH response to growth hormone-releasing hormone (GHRH) stimulation test with simultaneous administration of pyridostigmine in obese children showed increased GH levels, attributed to the reduced induced somatostatinergic tone. Meanwhile, children with PWS still exhibited lower GH response and reduced serum IGF-1 concentrations, confirming a genuine GHD (<xref rid=""B105"" ref-type=""bibr"">105</xref>). GHD is a progressive process in individuals with PWS. According to Cohen et al., stimulated levels of GH in infants with PWS were higher compared to older children or adults, suggesting that younger children may have a normal GH pituitary reserve (<xref rid=""B106"" ref-type=""bibr"">106</xref>). Additionally, some studies have indicated that in young children with PWS, standard stimulation tests (clonidine and arginine) result in low GH peaks in most patients, whereas combined stimulation tests (GHRH+arginine or pyridostigmine) show normal results in the majority of PWS tested children. This suggests that very young PWS children may have impaired hypothalamic GHRH secretion with a normal GH pituitary reserve, which could diminish as they grow older, possibly resulting in insufficient levels of GH (<xref rid=""B107"" ref-type=""bibr"">107</xref>). Therefore, the efficacy of standard GH stimulation tests as an indicator of GH status in younger individuals with PWS is still a topic of debate. Additionally, it has been demonstrated that, using the potentiated GHRH+arginine stimulation test, GH response is greater in children than in adults (<xref rid=""B108"" ref-type=""bibr"">108</xref>). Reduced GH bioactivity has also been shown in children and adolescents with PWS. This should be taken into account in the small number of affected individuals with PWS and growth failure who exhibit normal growth hormone responses after standard stimulation tests (<xref rid=""B109"" ref-type=""bibr"">109</xref>). Additionally, low growth hormone secretion has been found in 24-hour frequent blood sampling studies, which is consistent with neurosecretory GHD based on current knowledge (<xref rid=""B108"" ref-type=""bibr"">108</xref>). Furthermore, impaired GH secretion in these individuals is linked to a reduction in visceral fat and elevated ghrelin concentrations relative to the degree of obesity (<xref rid=""B110"" ref-type=""bibr"">110</xref>). Ghrelin, a stomach-derived hormone that stimulates GH secretion, can be increased in individuals with PWS before the onset of obesity, which is a distinct feature not typically seen in common obesity or other genetic obesities (<xref rid=""B111"" ref-type=""bibr"">111</xref>, <xref rid=""B112"" ref-type=""bibr"">112</xref>). However, due to the various forms of ghrelin and their effects, it is currently challenging to establish clear relationships with GH secretion in PWS (<xref rid=""B113"" ref-type=""bibr"">113</xref>). During the transition phase, around 20% of individuals with PWS displayed a GHD status based on BMI-dependent criteria (<xref rid=""B114"" ref-type=""bibr"">114</xref>), while GHD was found in 8-38% of adult patients (<xref rid=""B115"" ref-type=""bibr"">115</xref>). Some genotype-phenotype correlations have been identified in relation to GH secretion (<xref rid=""B116"" ref-type=""bibr"">116</xref>), but there is a lack of literature on the changes in the IGF system (<xref rid=""T3"" ref-type=""table"">
<bold>Table 3</bold>
</xref>). It is worth noting that patients with mUPD are more likely to have GHD compared to those with deletions (80% versus 25%) (<xref rid=""B100"" ref-type=""bibr"">100</xref>, <xref rid=""B107"" ref-type=""bibr"">107</xref>–<xref rid=""B109"" ref-type=""bibr"">109</xref>). No significant differences have been observed between individuals with type I and type II deletions (<xref rid=""B98"" ref-type=""bibr"">98</xref>, <xref rid=""B107"" ref-type=""bibr"">107</xref>, <xref rid=""B108"" ref-type=""bibr"">108</xref>, <xref rid=""B117"" ref-type=""bibr"">117</xref>). Additionally, only those with paternal deletions show a correlation between GH response to stimulation and BMI, which is not seen in subjects with mUPD (<xref rid=""B108"" ref-type=""bibr"">108</xref>). Patients with paternal gene microdeletions also exhibit better GH responses to stimulation than those with mUPD, who experience delayed GH peaks after stimulation as a distinctive feature. Interestingly, children with del15q11-q13 are longer at birth than those with mUPD, and the latter are shorter than PWS patients without deletions (<xref rid=""B105"" ref-type=""bibr"">105</xref>). Deletions in PWS, particularly those affecting genes involved in neural development, brain function, infertility, and circadian rhythm, such as SNORD116, can result in proconvertase 1 deficiency leading to GHD, short stature, hypogonadism, hyperghrelinemia, relative hypoinsulinemia, and T2DM. Therefore, special attention should be paid to these children for early replacement treatment consideration (<xref rid=""B100"" ref-type=""bibr"">100</xref>). In both the transition phase and in adult patients, the GH peak response to GHRH+arginine was significantly higher in patients with del15q than in those with mUPD (<xref rid=""B114"" ref-type=""bibr"">114</xref>, <xref rid=""B117"" ref-type=""bibr"">117</xref>). GH therapy in children with PWS was initially approved by the Food and Drug Administration in 2000 and by the European Medicines Agency in 2001. The Consensus Guidelines of the Growth Hormone Research Society in 2013 recommended GH therapy for all children with genetically confirmed PWS, in addition to dietary, lifestyle, and environmental interventions (<xref rid=""B118"" ref-type=""bibr"">118</xref>). The goals of GH therapy in PWS go beyond simply improving growth (<xref rid=""B99"" ref-type=""bibr"">99</xref>), as it has a positive impact on various clinical aspects and the quality of life of affected individuals. GH therapy results in improved body composition, with a decrease in fat mass and an increase in lean mass (<xref rid=""B119"" ref-type=""bibr"">119</xref>, <xref rid=""B120"" ref-type=""bibr"">120</xref>). It also has a positive effect on muscle strength, motor function (<xref rid=""B121"" ref-type=""bibr"">121</xref>, <xref rid=""B122"" ref-type=""bibr"">122</xref>), and bone mineral density (<xref rid=""B123"" ref-type=""bibr"">123</xref>). Furthermore, improvements in neurological and behavioral impairments, such as achieving motor milestones earlier and developing adaptive skills, have been reported (<xref rid=""B124"" ref-type=""bibr"">124</xref>). In adulthood, GH treatment has been shown to have beneficial effects on lean and fat mass, muscle performance, and quality of life (<xref rid=""B116"" ref-type=""bibr"">116</xref>). The positive effects on body composition and fat distribution are maintained for an average of 17 years, regardless of GH secretory status (<xref rid=""B125"" ref-type=""bibr"">125</xref>). However, it is necessary to confirm the presence of GHD after reaching final height before initiating GH therapy (<xref rid=""B118"" ref-type=""bibr"">118</xref>). According to previous expert opinions (<xref rid=""B118"" ref-type=""bibr"">118</xref>, <xref rid=""B119"" ref-type=""bibr"">119</xref>), in pediatric age, it is not necessary to assess GH/IGF-1 function before starting GH treatment. However, some contraindications to GH therapy are present in subjects with PWS, such as severe obesity or severe respiratory impairment, acute critical illness, uncontrolled diabetes, active cancer, and active psychosis (<xref rid=""B118"" ref-type=""bibr"">118</xref>). There is no consensus on the age at which to start therapy, but there is agreement on starting before the onset of obesity, which often occurs at around 2 years of age (<xref rid=""B118"" ref-type=""bibr"">118</xref>). Some studies have shown a better benefit in starting therapy in the first year of life, between 4 and 6 months (<xref rid=""B122"" ref-type=""bibr"">122</xref>, <xref rid=""B124"" ref-type=""bibr"">124</xref>) or even at 3 months (<xref rid=""B118"" ref-type=""bibr"">118</xref>). The recommended dose is 1.0 mg/m2 per day, achieved within approximately 3-6 months of starting treatment (<xref rid=""B118"" ref-type=""bibr"">118</xref>). This dose is higher than that usually used in congenital GHD, but lower doses showed a reduced effect on body composition (<xref rid=""B126"" ref-type=""bibr"">126</xref>, <xref rid=""B127"" ref-type=""bibr"">127</xref>). If body surface area is not used for dose calculation, it is recommended to use a nonobese weight for height as a reference in obese patients (<xref rid=""B118"" ref-type=""bibr"">118</xref>). PWS patients seem to be particularly sensitive to GH, as at standard doses they often present IGF-1 levels above the normal limits, in particular in individuals with PWS due to mUPD (<xref rid=""B128"" ref-type=""bibr"">128</xref>); special care must be taken in biochemical monitoring for a possible association between IGF-1 values and the occurrence of adverse effects (<xref rid=""B129"" ref-type=""bibr"">129</xref>–<xref rid=""B131"" ref-type=""bibr"">131</xref>). Therefore, it is recommended that IGF-1 levels remain within the upper normal range (+1 to +2 SDS) for age-matched normal children during GH therapy, and it is indicated in infants and children with PWS to start therapy with a daily dose of 0.5 mg/m2 per day to minimize side effects, with subsequent adjustments toward 1.0 mg/m2 per day (<xref rid=""B117"" ref-type=""bibr"">117</xref>). Scheermeyer et al. reported that treating infants with a low dose of GH (4.5 mg/m2/week) leads to a normalization of IGF-1 and height SDS within the first year of therapy with minimal risk of side effects (<xref rid=""B132"" ref-type=""bibr"">132</xref>). However, no relationship between malignancies and GH treatment has been reported in a large cohort of patients with PWS (<xref rid=""B133"" ref-type=""bibr"">133</xref>). A recent study has shown that the genetic diagnosis of PWS and the start of GH therapy occur earlier in patients with a del15q than in those with mUPD and an imprinting center defect (ID) (<xref rid=""B31"" ref-type=""bibr"">31</xref>). According to the study, patients with del15q are typically diagnosed in the second year of life, while other PWS patients are diagnosed in the fourth year of life. Additionally, GH therapy is initiated at an average age of 4.24 years in del15q patients, 7.3 years in mUPD 15, and 6.42 years in those with mUPD/ID. Although mean IGF-1 values before GH treatment were within the reference range for age and sex, del15q patients had significantly higher IGF-1 levels compared to mUPD/ID (-0.83 ± 0.46 SDS vs -1.03 ± 0.43 SDS), despite no significant differences in height SDS. Among patients with mUPD, GHD is more common and severe than patients with a del15q (<xref rid=""B116"" ref-type=""bibr"">116</xref>). However, Oto and colleagues found that there was no significant difference in yearly height improvement between these two groups of patients (<xref rid=""B134"" ref-type=""bibr"">134</xref>). Nonetheless, when looking at subgroups meeting the criteria for GHD, mUPD patients showed a significantly better response to rhGH treatment in terms of annual growth rate than deletion patients (0.42 ± 0.26 for del15q vs 0.7 ± 0.21 for mUPD; p=0.0044). Variability in response to GH therapy may also be linked to the presence of an exon-3 deletion polymorphism of the GH receptor (d3 allele), which is present in around 50% of the Caucasian population (<xref rid=""B135"" ref-type=""bibr"">135</xref>). In children with PWS, those who are heterozygous or homozygous for the d3 allele are more sensitive and responsive to GH treatment, leading to a significant increase in growth compared to those who are homozygous for the full-length GHR allele (<xref rid=""B136"" ref-type=""bibr"">136</xref>). Similar outcomes are observed in non-PWS children undergoing GH therapy (<xref rid=""B135"" ref-type=""bibr"">135</xref>). According to literature, adult patients with del15q show higher body weight and BMI compared to those with mUPD. However, both groups have similar proportions of fat mass, adipocyte volume, and insulin resistance markers (<xref rid=""B137"" ref-type=""bibr"">137</xref>). These findings suggest that growth hormone therapy during childhood and/or adolescence may lead to a better metabolic profile in adults with PWS who have del15q, but not in those with mUPD, thus lessening the phenotypic impact of the deletion. In terms of intellectual disability, Butler et al. analyzed cognitive skills and proposed that rhGH therapy could help prevent cognitive decline in individuals with PWS, especially those with mUPD (<xref rid=""B138"" ref-type=""bibr"">138</xref>). Differences between mUPD and del15q have also been documented in relation to psychiatric issues: individuals with del15q exhibit higher levels of aggression compared to those with mUPD (p=0.007) (<xref rid=""B139"" ref-type=""bibr"">139</xref>), are more likely to engage in skin picking (p=0.008) (<xref rid=""B139"" ref-type=""bibr"">139</xref>) and are more prone to developing compulsions and self-injury (<xref rid=""B140"" ref-type=""bibr"">140</xref>, <xref rid=""B141"" ref-type=""bibr"">141</xref>). On the other hand, mUPD 15 is associated with an increased risk of anxiety disorders (p=0.04) and psychoses (<xref rid=""B142"" ref-type=""bibr"">142</xref>). Moreover, GH therapy has shown a significant link to the development of anxiety and delusions (2.7 times increased association with anxiety, p=0.05; 14 times increased association with delusions, p=0.03). Specifically, GH therapy poses a higher risk of anxiety in individuals with mUPD (3.25-fold increase) compared to those with del15q (2.73-fold increase), regardless of treatment duration (<xref rid=""B139"" ref-type=""bibr"">139</xref>). In relation to orthopedic issues, a higher incidence of scoliosis has been reported among individuals with PWS who have received rhGH treatment and have a deletion (p=0.011). On the other hand, scoliosis is more common in patients with mUPD who have not undergone therapy (p=0.039) (<xref rid=""B143"" ref-type=""bibr"">143</xref>). However, data from the literature do not show any significant connection between scoliosis and rhGH treatment (<xref rid=""B144"" ref-type=""bibr"">144</xref>). The same authors also noted that kyphosis occurs in similar proportions in individuals with a deletion and mUPD undergoing rhGH therapy, but among untreated patients, it is more prevalent in those with a deletion rather than mUPD (p=0.001). Additionally, they found differing associations between genotype and phenotype in individuals with a deletion receiving rhGH treatment compared to those with mUPD, particularly in terms of having a flat back of the head (p=0.002) and abdominal stretch marks (p=0.006), which were more common in the former group. They also observed that ocular signs, such as eyes that slant downwards and strabismus, were more frequent in individuals with mUPD receiving growth hormone therapy (p=0.006 and p=0.011). The clinical symptoms of PWS can vary depending on age. In later childhood, patients can become severely obese unless their food intake is closely monitored by family and caregivers. Individuals with PWS often experience insatiable hunger, known as hyperphagia, and other compulsive behaviors, typically developing between the ages of 2 and 5 years (<xref rid=""B21"" ref-type=""bibr"">21</xref>, <xref rid=""B145"" ref-type=""bibr"">145</xref>, <xref rid=""B146"" ref-type=""bibr"">146</xref>). While the exact cause of hyperphagia in PWS is not fully understood, it is believed to involve abnormalities in hypothalamic satiety pathways. This may include hypothalamic malformations or related neurochemical mechanisms (<xref rid=""B147"" ref-type=""bibr"">147</xref>, <xref rid=""B148"" ref-type=""bibr"">148</xref>). However, abnormal eating behaviors in PWS cannot be solely attributed to hypothalamic dysfunction. Functional brain imaging techniques, such as functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and fluoro-deoxy-glucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET), have shown that the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) is activated when individuals consume food until they feel full. Signals related to satiety and visceral cues within the OFC significantly influence food perception, resulting in a response that reflects the food’s reward value or appeal. Individuals with PWS have been found to have altered OFC responses to satiety in functional brain imaging studies (<xref rid=""B149"" ref-type=""bibr"">149</xref>). The olfactory system also plays a crucial role in nutrition and social behavior, with connections to the endocrine regulation of energy balance (<xref rid=""B150"" ref-type=""bibr"">150</xref>). It can trigger a specific appetite for relevant foods, known as sensory-specific appetite, helping us detect and respond to food in our environment. A study involving adults with PWS (<xref rid=""B150"" ref-type=""bibr"">150</xref>) revealed abnormal brain reward system activity, particularly at the right amygdala level, in response to food odors. This heightened amygdala activity corresponds to the rapid and craving-inducing reaction to the odor, aligning with the concept of food-related addictive behaviors. Additionally, this increased activity is linked to the severity of hyperphagia, suggesting that changes in the brain circuits processing food odors may contribute to this phenomenon in PWS (<xref rid=""B150"" ref-type=""bibr"">150</xref>). Individuals with PWS have elevated levels of ghrelin and oxytocin, both of which are involved in addictive behaviors. These hormones not only impact the hypothalamus and limbic system but also influence the olfactory bulb, affecting sensory processing. Elevated fasting levels of ghrelin, hyperadiponectinemia, hypoinsulinemia, and increased ghrelin/PYY values compared to obese controls have been described (<xref rid=""B151"" ref-type=""bibr"">151</xref>). Ghrelin abnormalities may contribute to hyperphagia and food-related thoughts and cravings in PWS, while oxytocin dysfunction may affect emotional processing and appetite regulation (<xref rid=""B150"" ref-type=""bibr"">150</xref>). None of the genetic defects associated with PWS are directly linked to specific clinical traits. However, some connections have been found between different molecular classes and clinical features, including eating behavior and obesity. Several studies have investigated possible differences in compulsive behavior among the three most prevalent genetic subtypes (Type I deletion, Type II deletion, and mUPD). These behaviors often center around food-related problems, like searching for and saving food, acting on impulse, and repeatedly asking for food. These behaviors ultimately play a role in the onset of obesity. Therefore, it is clear that individuals with mUPD show a lower frequency and severity of compulsions compared to those with deletions. However, the available data on potential differences between the two types of deletions are inconclusive (<xref rid=""B145"" ref-type=""bibr"">145</xref>). Type I deletions, which affect a greater number of genes, seem to be associated with more severe compulsions than Type II deletions (<xref rid=""B145"" ref-type=""bibr"">145</xref>). Yet, other studies have found no noticeable distinctions (<xref rid=""B152"" ref-type=""bibr"">152</xref>, <xref rid=""B153"" ref-type=""bibr"">153</xref>). Dykens et al. (<xref rid=""B153"" ref-type=""bibr"">153</xref>) conducted a cohort study with eighty-eight individuals (43 males and 45 females) with PWS ranging from 5 to 51 years old. Their research did not find any clear differences between deletion subtypes, but they did notice significant variations within each subtype in terms of the relationship between age and behavior. Specifically, in the Type I group, they found negative correlations between age and behavior, possibly due to non-imprinted genes like CYFIP1. The CYFIP1 gene, which is also involved in other developmental disorders like 15q abnormalities, may contribute to age-related changes in the phenotype of individuals with Type I PWS due to its haploinsufficiency in those cases. Deficiencies in imprinted genes, such as MKRN3, MAGEL2, and/or NDN, are not enough on their own to cause the full range of symptoms seen in individuals with PWS. However, they do seem to be involved in the development of overeating and obesity. There is evidence to suggest that mutations in the MAGEL2 gene may contribute to the characteristic weight gain seen in individuals with PWS. Overeating is linked to a malfunction in the hypothalamic arcuate nucleus, which is where neuropeptide Y (NPY), agouti-related peptide (AgRP), proopiomelanocortin (POMC), and leptin interact to regulate food intake and body weight. NPY and AgRP stimulate food intake, while POMC works to suppress it. In experimental models, a loss of MAGEL2 expression disrupts the normal response of POMC neurons to leptin, leading to increased food intake and uncontrolled fat storage (<xref rid=""B154"" ref-type=""bibr"">154</xref>, <xref rid=""B155"" ref-type=""bibr"">155</xref>). A study by Schaaf et al. identified specific point mutations in the paternal allele of MAGEL2 in four individuals with PWS, where weight gain was a prominent feature along with muscle weakness, developmental delays, and hypogonadism (<xref rid=""B81"" ref-type=""bibr"">81</xref>). Kanber and colleagues described a patient with deletions in MKRN3, MAGEL2, and NDN, exhibiting only obesity, developmental delay, and a high pain threshold as the primary clinical criteria for PWS (<xref rid=""B14"" ref-type=""bibr"">14</xref>). Regarding the series of long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) which can be involved in the regulation of gene expression at transcriptional and post-transcriptional levels in PWS, within the long SNURF-SNRPN transcript, there are a series of Small Nucleolar RNAs (snoRNAs) thought to participate in DNA methylation, alternative splicing, and post-transcriptional regulation, such as SNORD116 and SNORD115. The SNORD116 cluster is crucial in the PWS phenotype. As reported, SNORD116 is involved in controlling NPY neuronal functions, and thus food intake and energy homeostasis. Experimental models on Snord116-KO mice showed PWS features such as hyperphagia (<xref rid=""B156"" ref-type=""bibr"">156</xref>–<xref rid=""B159"" ref-type=""bibr"">159</xref>). De Smith et al. (<xref rid=""B160"" ref-type=""bibr"">160</xref>) reported a 19-year-old male with hyperphagia and severe obesity, mild intellectual disability, and hypogonadism with a 187 kb deletion that included SNORD116. The SNORD115 gene contains a complementary sequence of 18 nucleotides that matches the mRNA for the serotonin receptor 5-HT2C. Studies on 5-HT2C receptor knockout mice have shown that lack of SNORD115 protein may cause problems with the 5-HT2C receptor, leading to abnormal eating behavior and late-onset obesity (<xref rid=""B161"" ref-type=""bibr"">161</xref>, <xref rid=""B162"" ref-type=""bibr"">162</xref>). Additionally, aside from SNURF-SNRPN and the SNORD gene family, the potential role of NPAP1 in obesity development should be considered (<xref rid=""B162"" ref-type=""bibr"">162</xref>). Kanber et al. found two patients with deletions in NPAP1, SNURF-SNRPN, and the SNORD genes, who exhibited major clinical signs of PWS, including obesity (<xref rid=""B14"" ref-type=""bibr"">14</xref>). In summary, although data linking genotype and obesity in human studies is limited, these findings underscore the importance of taking a comprehensive approach to studying phenotypes throughout life. The metabolic syndrome (MetS) is a common complication of overweight/obesity, leading to T2DM and cardiovascular disease. Diagnosis requires meeting at least 3 of the following criteria: central obesity, arterial hypertension, high triglyceride levels, altered glucose metabolism, and low HDL cholesterol levels (<xref rid=""B163"" ref-type=""bibr"">163</xref>). Insulin resistance (IR) and obesity are thought to be central factors in the development of MetS (<xref rid=""B163"" ref-type=""bibr"">163</xref>, <xref rid=""B164"" ref-type=""bibr"">164</xref>). Identifying predictive factors for MetS may improve treatment outcomes and prevent severe complications. Individuals with PWS appear to have a healthier metabolic profile compared to those with essential obesity. This is due to their distribution of subcutaneous fat, higher insulin sensitivity, increased levels of adiponectin and HDL cholesterol, lower rates of fatty liver disease, and reduced cytokines (<xref rid=""B165"" ref-type=""bibr"">165</xref>–<xref rid=""B170"" ref-type=""bibr"">170</xref>). However, PWS patients may have higher blood glucose and blood pressure levels, with no significant differences in insulin or insulin resistance compared to controls (<xref rid=""B171"" ref-type=""bibr"">171</xref>, <xref rid=""B172"" ref-type=""bibr"">172</xref>). Additionally, PWS individuals are more likely to have altered glucose metabolism and T2DM (<xref rid=""B173"" ref-type=""bibr"">173</xref>), although the exact mechanisms are still unknown. The prevalence of MetS in PWS adults and children is 34% and 7% respectively (<xref rid=""B172"" ref-type=""bibr"">172</xref>, <xref rid=""B174"" ref-type=""bibr"">174</xref>), potentially contributing to the reported early mortality rates in the PWS population (<xref rid=""B171"" ref-type=""bibr"">171</xref>, <xref rid=""B175"" ref-type=""bibr"">175</xref>). Several studies have compared non-syndromic obesity and PWS, but there is limited data available on the clinical features associated with specific PWS genotypes. In particular, information on the genotype-phenotype characterization of MertS and its characteristics is fragmented. It has been found that adipocyte size is increased in PWS compared to obese controls, with variations observed in different genotypic subclasses (<xref rid=""B176"" ref-type=""bibr"">176</xref>). Patients with a del15q genotype tend to have higher BMI (<xref rid=""B137"" ref-type=""bibr"">137</xref>, <xref rid=""B176"" ref-type=""bibr"">176</xref>, <xref rid=""B177"" ref-type=""bibr"">177</xref>) and HbA1c levels, despite similar values of glycemia, insulinemia, insulin resistance, body composition, metabolic profile, adipocyte size, resting energy expenditure, hyperphagia score, and levels of ghrelin compared to those with mUPD, suggesting a possible association between mUPD genotype and a more adverse metabolic profile, even when adjusted for BMI. The most common form of dyslipidemia in PWS patients, occurring in about 50% of cases, appears to be a decrease in HDL cholesterol, with no significant difference between genetic subtypes (<xref rid=""B137"" ref-type=""bibr"">137</xref>). Additionally, data from a study involving 108 PWS subjects indicated that the del15q group had a lower risk for low HDL cholesterol and a trend towards a lower risk for MetS compared to non-deleted patients (<xref rid=""B172"" ref-type=""bibr"">172</xref>). These findings suggest that the del15q genotype group may have the healthiest metabolic profile among adult PWS individuals. Talebizadeh et al. (<xref rid=""B168"" ref-type=""bibr"">168</xref>) assessed the body fat composition, IR, leptin, and lipid profile in 55 individuals with PWS and 18 obese controls. They found that in obese individuals, there was a direct correlation between insulin levels and weight, as well as between BMI and subcutaneous fat area. However, these correlations were not observed in the PWS group. On the other hand, PWS patients showed a strong direct correlation between insulin levels and fat area (both visceral and subcutaneous). Specifically, visceral fat and insulin levels were significantly related in the del15q group. Additionally, visceral fat area and triglycerides were directly correlated with the age of individuals in the obese control group but not in the PWS groups. In the del15q and mUPD groups, a positive correlation was found between glucose and triglyceride levels. In the del15q group, there was also a positive correlation between cholesterol and glucose, triglycerides and visceral fat area, insulin and visceral fat area, insulin and triglycerides, and insulin and total cholesterol. These findings suggest a different and specific metabolic profile, at least for one genetic subtype. Adiponectin is a hormone that sensitizes insulin, and low levels of adiponectin are associated with obesity and MetS. Patients with PWS have higher levels of adiponectin compared to obese individuals, regardless of their physical characteristics (<xref rid=""B178"" ref-type=""bibr"">178</xref>). This was shown in some recent studies (<xref rid=""B169"" ref-type=""bibr"">169</xref>, <xref rid=""B174"" ref-type=""bibr"">174</xref>, <xref rid=""B179"" ref-type=""bibr"">179</xref>) involving different numbers of PWS patients. These studies found no statistical differences in parameters such as insulin, glucose, HOMA, triglycerides, HDL, BMI, and blood pressure among different PWS genotypes. Irisin regulates glucose levels and insulin sensitivity by promoting glucose uptake and glycogenolysis, as well as reducing gluconeogenesis. It may have a role in obesity and MetS through controlling body weight and regulating the accumulation of white adipose tissue. In a study comparing 25 PWS patients and 25 obese individuals, irisin levels were significantly lower in PWS patients with a del15q compared to obese controls, while patients with a mUPD did not show significant differences compared to controls (<xref rid=""B180"" ref-type=""bibr"">180</xref>) (<xref rid=""T4"" ref-type=""table"">
<bold>Table 4</bold>
</xref>). Obesity plays an important role in the risk of T2DM in individuals with PWS, as in the general population (<xref rid=""B171"" ref-type=""bibr"">171</xref>, <xref rid=""B173"" ref-type=""bibr"">173</xref>, <xref rid=""B181"" ref-type=""bibr"">181</xref>). However, the prevalence of T2DM in PWSs tends to be lower than in obese controls (<xref rid=""B165"" ref-type=""bibr"">165</xref>, <xref rid=""B182"" ref-type=""bibr"">182</xref>). The relationship between adipose tissue (AT) and glucose metabolism in PWS remains largely unknown, although several studies have observed indices of lower IR compared to controls (<xref rid=""B166"" ref-type=""bibr"">166</xref>, <xref rid=""B183"" ref-type=""bibr"">183</xref>, <xref rid=""B184"" ref-type=""bibr"">184</xref>). The possible explanations for the higher insulin sensitivity in PWS could be the relatively lower visceral adipose tissue (VAT) and higher subcutaneous adipose tissue (SAT) than BMI-matched controls, as well as the predominant accumulation of subcutaneous fat in the trunk and proximal limbs, with a lower ratio of trunk-to-appendicular fat (<xref rid=""B167"" ref-type=""bibr"">167</xref>, <xref rid=""B185"" ref-type=""bibr"">185</xref>, <xref rid=""B186"" ref-type=""bibr"">186</xref>); the downregulation of many IR-associated genes in the AT of subjects with PWS, including those encoding proinflammatory markers (<xref rid=""B176"" ref-type=""bibr"">176</xref>); the elevated levels of ghrelin (<xref rid=""B187"" ref-type=""bibr"">187</xref>) and adiponectin (<xref rid=""B183"" ref-type=""bibr"">183</xref>); the impaired GH secretion (<xref rid=""B110"" ref-type=""bibr"">110</xref>); the lower high-sensitivity C-reactive protein and IL-6 concentrations (<xref rid=""B166"" ref-type=""bibr"">166</xref>); the different composition of the gut microbiota compared to patients with obesity (<xref rid=""B188"" ref-type=""bibr"">188</xref>). Therefore, the pathophysiological mechanisms underlying T2DM in PWS might be different from those involved in common obesity. Since IR is an important risk factor for the development of T2DM, the relatively lower IR could be a protective factor against the risk of developing T2DM in PWS patients, which is common in adults but rarely develops in childhood. More generally, the prevalence of T2DM in adults with PWS ranges from 11 to 25%, compared to 5 to 7% in the general population (<xref rid=""B173"" ref-type=""bibr"">173</xref>, <xref rid=""B189"" ref-type=""bibr"">189</xref>), while it is reported less than 2% in patients younger than 18 years of age (<xref rid=""B190"" ref-type=""bibr"">190</xref>). On the other hand, data from a cohort of 74 children with PWS showed the presence of impaired glucose tolerance by OGTT in 4% of subjects, but no T2DM (<xref rid=""B36"" ref-type=""bibr"">36</xref>). In this context, the different genotypes (del15q or mUPD) do not appear to be correlated with the development of altered glucose homeostasis in PWS (<xref rid=""B174"" ref-type=""bibr"">174</xref>). Furthermore, no genotype-phenotype correlation studies seem to emerge from the literature review. In addition, it should be noted that rare cases of T1DM have also been described (<xref rid=""B191"" ref-type=""bibr"">191</xref>). The average age at diagnosis of T2DM in PWSs is about 20 years (<xref rid=""B171"" ref-type=""bibr"">171</xref>, <xref rid=""B173"" ref-type=""bibr"">173</xref>, <xref rid=""B191"" ref-type=""bibr"">191</xref>). The onset of T2DM is closely related to the presence of obesity in PWS, the latter related to an insufficient and delayed satiety response, due to uncontrolled food intake mechanisms caused by a hypothalamic dysfunction (<xref rid=""B21"" ref-type=""bibr"">21</xref>, <xref rid=""B192"" ref-type=""bibr"">192</xref>). Currently, the only available control for hyperphagia for most people with PWS is external supervision by mentors with constant supervision, which is challenging and distressing for both caregivers and patients. Access to food must be limited to ensure low caloric intake, considering that children with PWS require 20-30% less energy intake than healthy children of the same age (<xref rid=""B193"" ref-type=""bibr"">193</xref>). Healthy lifestyles are at the forefront of management of altered glucose metabolism in PWS, with metformin as the first-line drug therapy. When monotherapy is not sufficient, sulfonylureas, meglitinides, thiazolidinediones, dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitors, glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) agonists (liraglutide, exenatide, semaglutide, dulaglutide) or insulin can be combined (<xref rid=""B171"" ref-type=""bibr"">171</xref>). In addition, sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 (SGLT-2) inhibitors have been used in adult patients with PWS in uncontrolled situations (<xref rid=""B194"" ref-type=""bibr"">194</xref>). Taking into consideration the pediatric age, only insulin and metformin are approved for children (over 10 years of age), but recently GLP-1 receptor agonists (liraglutide) have been introduced for the treatment of T2DM. Moreover, liraglutide has been approved for use in obese non-diabetic children older than 12 years. Some studies have reported the beneficial effects of incretin mimetics as an effective therapy for hyperphagia and obesity in PWS, considering its potential effects on ghrelin suppression, central appetite suppression (through its action on pro-opiomelanocortin POMC/CART neurons and cocaine- and amphetamine-regulated transcripts in the arcuate nucleus (<xref rid=""B195"" ref-type=""bibr"">195</xref>),), increased energy expenditure (EE) and stimulation of insulin secretion, which could counterbalance the hypoinsulinemia reported in PWS (<xref rid=""B196"" ref-type=""bibr"">196</xref>–<xref rid=""B200"" ref-type=""bibr"">200</xref>). However, the data are still conflicting and other authors have reported no effect of liraglutide on weight loss either in children and adolescents with PWS (<xref rid=""B201"" ref-type=""bibr"">201</xref>). The recommendations for screening for T2DM and metabolic syndrome are like the general guidelines for subjects with obesity (<xref rid=""B119"" ref-type=""bibr"">119</xref>). Patients with PWS should be screened for hemoglobin A1C, lipid profile, and transaminases at baseline and then annually. Regarding common diabetes-related complications, there are surprisingly few reports in the literature (<xref rid=""B202"" ref-type=""bibr"">202</xref>), and their follow-up is identical to that used in the general population. Although new drugs such as GLP-1 agonists show potential in controlling weight, appetite, and blood glucose in subjects with PWS, diet, physical activity, and behavioral modifications remain the main strategies to promote good metabolic health in these patients. PWS is characterized by dysfunction of the hypothalamus, leading to multiple endocrine disorders, including hypogonadism (<xref rid=""B203"" ref-type=""bibr"">203</xref>, <xref rid=""B204"" ref-type=""bibr"">204</xref>). In female patients, the clinical manifestation of hypogonadism can vary widely and may change at different stages of life (<xref rid=""B204"" ref-type=""bibr"">204</xref>, <xref rid=""B205"" ref-type=""bibr"">205</xref>). While newborns with PWS often have underdeveloped clitoris and labia minora, puberty and breast development typically start on time. However, the progression of puberty is slow, and incomplete development is commonly seen later in life. Most patients experience primary amenorrhea, but some may have spontaneous menarche at a much older age (around 20 years), followed by secondary amenorrhea or irregular periods (<xref rid=""B73"" ref-type=""bibr"">73</xref>, <xref rid=""B203"" ref-type=""bibr"">203</xref>, <xref rid=""B204"" ref-type=""bibr"">204</xref>). Overall, the prevalence of hypogonadism in adult females with PWS ranges from 54 to 100% (<xref rid=""B73"" ref-type=""bibr"">73</xref>, <xref rid=""B203"" ref-type=""bibr"">203</xref>, <xref rid=""B204"" ref-type=""bibr"">204</xref>). Hypogonadism in females with PWS is believed to be primarily caused by dysfunction of the hypothalamus. However, more recent studies suggest that primary ovarian dysfunction also plays a role (<xref rid=""B206"" ref-type=""bibr"">206</xref>, <xref rid=""B207"" ref-type=""bibr"">207</xref>). In some patients, a combination of central and peripheral hypogonadism may be present, making them unique from individuals with more typical disorders (<xref rid=""B207"" ref-type=""bibr"">207</xref>, <xref rid=""B208"" ref-type=""bibr"">208</xref>). Some authors have reported extremely low or undetectable inhibin B levels alongside normal or subnormal Anti Mullerian Hormone (AMH) levels, indicating a specific defect in folliculogenesis. However, a small subgroup of women have detectable inhibin B levels, potentially indicating partial ovarian follicular development and serving as a possible marker of fertility (<xref rid=""B205"" ref-type=""bibr"">205</xref>–<xref rid=""B208"" ref-type=""bibr"">208</xref>). Pregnancy has been documented in a small number of women with genetically confirmed PWS (<xref rid=""B204"" ref-type=""bibr"">204</xref>, <xref rid=""B209"" ref-type=""bibr"">209</xref>, <xref rid=""B210"" ref-type=""bibr"">210</xref>). Additionally, precocious puberty has rarely been observed in females with PWS (<xref rid=""B211"" ref-type=""bibr"">211</xref>). MKRN3, a gene located in the critical region of PWS, has been implicated in regulating pubertal development in typical individuals. MKRN3 deficiency has been identified as a common genetic cause of CPP, with different prevalence rates in sporadic (0.5-17-5%) versus familial (9-46%) cases (<xref rid=""B212"" ref-type=""bibr"">212</xref>, <xref rid=""B213"" ref-type=""bibr"">213</xref>). Research on the influence of MKRN3 on pubertal development in females with PWS is limited. Mariani et al. (<xref rid=""B214"" ref-type=""bibr"">214</xref>) evaluated MKRN3 protein levels in 80 individuals with PWS at various stages of pubertal development. They found that MKRN3 levels were measurable in 49 patients with PWS, but did not correlate with phenotype, genotype, or gonadotropin levels. This suggests that different genetic mechanisms at the tissue level may be involved in pubertal development in individuals with PWS (<xref rid=""B213"" ref-type=""bibr"">213</xref>, <xref rid=""B214"" ref-type=""bibr"">214</xref>). Many studies have investigated the potential correlation between genetic background and hypogonadal dysfunction in individuals with PWS, but no data have shown an impact of the various genetic defects (such as 15q11-13 paternal deletion, mUPD, or imprinting defect) on pubertal development and fertility (<xref rid=""B73"" ref-type=""bibr"">73</xref>, <xref rid=""B203"" ref-type=""bibr"">203</xref>, <xref rid=""B204"" ref-type=""bibr"">204</xref>). Despite a lack of connections between PWS genotype and puberty in humans, research on animal models replicating PWS has suggested that certain genes may be involved in hypothalamic-ovary dysfunction. The human chromosome 15q11-q13, also known as mouse chromosome 7C, is an imprinting domain regulated by bipartite imprinting centers (IC). Studies on this chromosome region in the PWS mouse model have revealed varying expression and methylation in different tissues (<xref rid=""B215"" ref-type=""bibr"">215</xref>). Specifically, research by Mapendano et al. (<xref rid=""B216"" ref-type=""bibr"">216</xref>) has demonstrated abundant expression of the IC transcript in the brain and ovaries of the mouse model, particularly in granulosa cells of developing oocytes. In regards to the Necdin gene, which has been proposed as a potential candidate for PWS in humans due to its lack of expression in the brain, the mouse knockout model exhibited impaired development of GnRH neurons (<xref rid=""B217"" ref-type=""bibr"">217</xref>). Taken together, these preliminary findings from experimental models suggest a potential influence of gene expression and methylation at the brain and oocyte/follicle levels on pubertal development in individuals with PWS. PWS presents many challenges, with hypogonadism being identified as the most common hormonal deficiency among affected individuals. Studies by Partsch et al., Matsuyama et al., and Pellikaan et al. have reported that the prevalence of hypogonadism in adult males with PWS ranges from 57% to 100% (<xref rid=""B218"" ref-type=""bibr"">218</xref>–<xref rid=""B220"" ref-type=""bibr"">220</xref>). Driscoll et al. (<xref rid=""B221"" ref-type=""bibr"">221</xref>) have emphasized the significant impact of hypogonadism in PWS, leading to issues such as genital hypoplasia, incomplete pubertal development, and infertility in most cases. The development of hypogonadism in males with PWS is diverse, with a variety of causes from central to peripheral hypogonadism. Hirsch et al. and Radicioni et al. have highlighted the occurrence of peripheral hypogonadism, a combination of central and peripheral forms, and pure hypothalamic deficit in some cases (<xref rid=""B206"" ref-type=""bibr"">206</xref>, <xref rid=""B222"" ref-type=""bibr"">222</xref>). Interestingly, there is no established correlation between genotype and phenotype, as reported by Lecka-Ambroziack and Pellikaan et al. (<xref rid=""B71"" ref-type=""bibr"">71</xref>, <xref rid=""B220"" ref-type=""bibr"">220</xref>). Hypogonadism affects males with PWS of all ages. In infancy, it is common to observe cryptorchidism, scrotal hypoplasia, and a short penile length (<xref rid=""B175"" ref-type=""bibr"">175</xref>). Eiholzer et al. recommend human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) treatment for males with PWS and cryptorchidism, as it can lead to lower testes and improved genital size before urologic surgery (<xref rid=""B223"" ref-type=""bibr"">223</xref>). Interestingly, cryptorchidism does not seem to be linked to gonadotropin levels, and there is no correlation between the age at orchidopexy and inhibin B levels, suggesting cryptorchidism does not play a major role in hypergonadotropic hypogonadism (<xref rid=""B203"" ref-type=""bibr"">203</xref>). During puberty, males with PWS commonly experience incomplete and delayed development, alongside frequent precocious adrenarche. Besides hypothalamic dysfunction, primary testicular involvement (especially in the seminiferous epithelium) and moderate Leydig cell dysfunction all contribute to abnormal pubertal development in males with PWS (<xref rid=""B224"" ref-type=""bibr"">224</xref>, <xref rid=""B225"" ref-type=""bibr"">225</xref>). Testicular histology often shows reduced or absent spermatogonia, with a progressive degeneration of germ cells during puberty (<xref rid=""B226"" ref-type=""bibr"">226</xref>). Lecka-Ambroziack, Linnemann et al., Siemensma et al. discuss the intricacies of pubertal development in PWS, with premature adrenarche seen in around 30% of cases. This could potentially lead to early puberty and compromised adult height without treatment (<xref rid=""B22"" ref-type=""bibr"">22</xref>, <xref rid=""B67"" ref-type=""bibr"">67</xref>, <xref rid=""B72"" ref-type=""bibr"">72</xref>, <xref rid=""B227"" ref-type=""bibr"">227</xref>). In males with PWS, premature pubarche is associated with early pubic hair growth, elevated levels of serum dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate or serum dehydroepiandrosterone, and advanced bone age. These factors might reduce the positive effects of growth hormone on adult height (<xref rid=""B67"" ref-type=""bibr"">67</xref>). While hypogonadism is the most common change in the pituitary-gonadal axis, CPP, though rare, has been documented in children with PWS and could be linked to loss-of-function variations in the MKRN3 gene at the 15q11-q13 locus (<xref rid=""B228"" ref-type=""bibr"">228</xref>, <xref rid=""B229"" ref-type=""bibr"">229</xref>). The MKRN3 gene is widely recognized as a cause of CPP in the general population (<xref rid=""B230"" ref-type=""bibr"">230</xref>). Normally, <italic toggle=""yes"">MKRN3</italic> is believed to prevent the start of puberty before adolescence at high levels in the brain. A deletion of the MKRN3 allele from the father in PWS can lead to early puberty. Alternatively, high levels of 17-hydroxyprogesterone and DHEA sulfate were found in patients with CPP, suggesting elevated adrenal androgen levels as previously reported in PWS. Therefore, a combination of a father-derived MKRN3 allele deletion, basal adrenarche, and hypothalamic-pituitary acceleration may play a role in the early onset of precocious puberty (<xref rid=""B229"" ref-type=""bibr"">229</xref>). The type of hypogonadism - hypogonadotropic, hypergonadotropic, or a mix of these - only becomes apparent in late adolescence or early adulthood and appears to stabilize after the age of 20 years (<xref rid=""B225"" ref-type=""bibr"">225</xref>). PWS is a disorder caused by the lack of expression of certain genes on chromosome 15. This can be due to different genetic mechanisms, such as deletion of the paternal chromosome 15q11-q13, maternal uniparental disomy for chromosome 15, abnormalities of the imprinting center, or translocations involving chromosome 15. The main characteristic of PWS is hypothalamic dysfunction, which leads to overeating, body temperature instability, increased pain tolerance, and pituitary issues resulting in various endocrine disorders. Autoimmunity could contribute, at least in part, to the hypothalamus-pituitary axis impairment in these individuals, in addition to the genetically determined dysfunction (<xref rid=""B47"" ref-type=""bibr"">47</xref>). However, we cannot exclude that anti-pituitary antibodies could be an “epiphenomenon”. Researchers have looked into whether the symptoms of PWS differ based on the underlying genetic cause. It has been observed that individuals with PWS due to deletion often experience sleep problems and speech difficulties (<xref rid=""B231"" ref-type=""bibr"">231</xref>) more frequently, with those with type I deletion displaying more compulsive behaviors and performing better academically than those with type II deletion (<xref rid=""B232"" ref-type=""bibr"">232</xref>, <xref rid=""B233"" ref-type=""bibr"">233</xref>). In contrast, individuals with mUPD tend to have more neurodevelopmental impairments, including autistic features and behavioral issues, but typically demonstrate higher IQ levels compared to those with deletion of the critical region of chromosome 15 (<xref rid=""B16"" ref-type=""bibr"">16</xref>, <xref rid=""B153"" ref-type=""bibr"">153</xref>, <xref rid=""B232"" ref-type=""bibr"">232</xref>–<xref rid=""B234"" ref-type=""bibr"">234</xref>). These findings suggest that different genetic backgrounds contribute to the variation in symptoms, especially when it comes to neurodevelopmental aspects. Prompted by this evidence, we reviewed the literature on endocrine features in PWS to evaluate whether a genotype-phenotype correlation can be established. We considered all the endocrine disorders described in this syndrome and concluded that the available data do not support such a correlation, except for some minor features. Literature data indicate that PWS patients have lower birth weight and a higher prevalence of preterm delivery and SGA (<xref rid=""B24"" ref-type=""bibr"">24</xref>) compared to the general population, and a tendency for post-term birth (<xref rid=""B32"" ref-type=""bibr"">32</xref>). Lower birth weight has been inconsistently described in newborns carrying the 15q11.2-q13 deletion (<xref rid=""B26"" ref-type=""bibr"">26</xref>–<xref rid=""B28"" ref-type=""bibr"">28</xref>, <xref rid=""B31"" ref-type=""bibr"">31</xref>, <xref rid=""B34"" ref-type=""bibr"">34</xref>). Whether perinatal characteristics are specific to genotype remains unclear, and further research is needed to clarify this issue, irrespective of pregnancy management. Thyroid disorders are quite common in these individuals, and the dysregulation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid axis is the most frequent cause (<xref rid=""B35"" ref-type=""bibr"">35</xref>–<xref rid=""B45"" ref-type=""bibr"">45</xref>). Studies that have attempted to find a correlation between different genotypes and phenotypes have been unsuccessful, suggesting that monitoring thyroid function should be done at any age (<xref rid=""SM1"" ref-type=""supplementary-material"">
<bold>Supplementary Table 1</bold>
</xref>). Similar to the thyroid gland, the adrenal gland may also produce insufficient cortisol, with the most common cause being central dysfunction. This can result in primary and secondary ACTH deficiency, especially during stressful situations. Cortisol levels were found to be lower in children with PWS due to del15q compared to those with UPD (<xref rid=""B52"" ref-type=""bibr"">52</xref>), but this was not consistent with other data from children (<xref rid=""B54"" ref-type=""bibr"">54</xref>) and adults (<xref rid=""B55"" ref-type=""bibr"">55</xref>). There was no correlation between genotype and fasting cortisol levels (<xref rid=""B64"" ref-type=""bibr"">64</xref>, <xref rid=""B65"" ref-type=""bibr"">65</xref>), although DHEA-S levels were found to be higher in individuals with del15q, leading to a higher rate of premature adrenarche in the paper by Gaston et al. (<xref rid=""B70"" ref-type=""bibr"">70</xref>) but not in the paper by Siemensma et al. (<xref rid=""B67"" ref-type=""bibr"">67</xref>). It is important to note that the diagnostic tests used to assess adrenal function are not consistent across studies, which may explain some discrepancies in findings. Fortunately, individuals with PWS typically do not experience adrenal crisis and do not require glucocorticoid treatment. There is still ongoing debate about the use of hydrocortisone for critical illness and surgery in these individuals, with no consensus reached yet. Growth mechanisms are considered as one of the most important research fields in PWS, both because of short stature and the availability of a treatment for over 20 years now (<xref rid=""B100"" ref-type=""bibr"">100</xref>, <xref rid=""B107"" ref-type=""bibr"">107</xref>–<xref rid=""B109"" ref-type=""bibr"">109</xref>). GHD has a 3 times higher incidence in patients with mUPD than in those with del15q. These latter patients also show a correlation between GH response to standard stimulation tests and BMI, as well as a better GH response to standard stimulation compared to mUPD patients (<xref rid=""B108"" ref-type=""bibr"">108</xref>). Current studies on IGF binding-protein cleavage and IGF bioavailability could offer new insights into the physiopathology of the GH-IGF-1 axis and linear growth mechanisms (<xref rid=""B235"" ref-type=""bibr"">235</xref>). In individuals with mUPD or ID, GH therapy appears to prevent cognitive decline, suggesting that cognitive skills may be more impaired in these individuals due to more severe GH secretion insufficiency. Currently, growth hormone therapy is discontinued when adolescents reach adulthood. In a recent letter to the editor, Höybye et al., on behalf of the Clinical and Scientific Advisory Board of The International Prader-Willi Syndrome Organisation (IPSWO), proposed that growth hormone treatment should be extended to adults with genetically confirmed PWS as well. This is an intriguing proposal, as it is widely recognized that in adulthood, growth hormone has positive effects on maintaining normal metabolism and body composition, physical fitness, and beneficial effects on cardiovascular risk factors, and ultimately, quality of life in these individuals (<xref rid=""B236"" ref-type=""bibr"">236</xref>). The absence of the sense of satiety is a key characteristic of PWS, resulting in excessive eating and weight gain, leading to MetS and T2DM. Although there is no evidence supporting a correlation between genotype and body fat distribution or obesity, research has suggested that certain genetic mechanisms involving the MKRN3 and MAGEL2 genes, as well as Small Nucleolar RNAs, may play a role in controlling body weight (<xref rid=""B14"" ref-type=""bibr"">14</xref>, <xref rid=""B81"" ref-type=""bibr"">81</xref>, <xref rid=""B156"" ref-type=""bibr"">156</xref>–<xref rid=""B162"" ref-type=""bibr"">162</xref>). While these genes are likely involved in the development of excessive eating and obesity in individuals with PWS, none of them fully explain the entire PWS phenotype. Obesity is the initial stage leading to MetS and T2DM. Despite being incomplete (<xref rid=""T4"" ref-type=""table"">
<bold>Table 4</bold>
</xref>), the available data on genotype-phenotype correlation suggests that individuals with PWS who have the del15q genetic subtype often have a higher BMI compared to other genetic subtypes. However, they also tend to have a healthier metabolic profile, which reduces the risk of complications from MetS (<xref rid=""B133"" ref-type=""bibr"">133</xref>, <xref rid=""B176"" ref-type=""bibr"">176</xref>, <xref rid=""B177"" ref-type=""bibr"">177</xref>). Additionally, compulsive eating behavior appears to be more common in individuals with mUPD (<xref rid=""B144"" ref-type=""bibr"">144</xref>), while those with the del15q subtype seem to respond better to multidisciplinary rehabilitation interventions (<xref rid=""B180"" ref-type=""bibr"">180</xref>) due to a lower prevalence of psychiatric disorders (<xref rid=""B5"" ref-type=""bibr"">5</xref>, <xref rid=""B237"" ref-type=""bibr"">237</xref>, <xref rid=""B238"" ref-type=""bibr"">238</xref>). Various studies have shown no differences in MetS parameters among different genetic subtypes within large population studies (<xref rid=""B169"" ref-type=""bibr"">169</xref>, <xref rid=""B174"" ref-type=""bibr"">174</xref>, <xref rid=""B179"" ref-type=""bibr"">179</xref>). This implies that the regulation of body weight and the development of MetS are more likely due to psychiatric, behavioral, and developmental factors rather than solely genetics. Surprisingly, the incidence of T2DM in PWS individuals is lower than expected (<xref rid=""B165"" ref-type=""bibr"">165</xref>, <xref rid=""B182"" ref-type=""bibr"">182</xref>), indicating they have a healthier metabolic profile compared to weight-matched healthy individuals. Further investigation into the food-seeking behavior leading to severe obesity could reveal distinctions between individuals with mUPD and del15q, aiding researchers in understanding the extent to which metabolic disorders stem from neurodevelopmental issues or genotype-phenotype correlation. This information can help predict complications and guide early interventions for obesity. Data regarding the onset of puberty and fertility are inconsistent, and a growing amount of data is emphasizing the importance of new genes in controlling puberty. It can be said that there is no clear link between the genes identified in the critical region of PWS and delayed puberty and/or hypogonadism. Additional studies, whether <italic toggle=""yes"">in vitro</italic> or using animal models, as well as pre-clinical and clinical studies involving humans, would be beneficial in further understanding this form of hypogonadism. In conclusion, the available data on endocrine disorders associated with PWS suggest that there is no clear genotype-phenotype association. Only some features of the GH-IGF-1 axis appear to be dependent on the different genotypes. However, a limitation of the analyzed papers is that the cohorts are not homogeneous, which could partially account for the contrasting results from different papers. Another potential limitation in drawing conclusions about genotype-phenotype associations is the small number of patients recruited in many of the referenced studies. Original research based on a very large cohort of people living with PWS, aiming to investigate the genotype-phenotype correlation, would be appreciated as they would shed new light on these features, supporting clinicians in optimizing follow-up.

Behavioral changes in patients with Prader-Willi syndrome receiving diazoxide choline extended-release tablets compared to the PATH for PWS natural history study,,"Prader–Willi syndrome (PWS) is a rare, complex genetic neurobehavioral/metabolic disorder with an estimated birth incidence of 1:15,000 to 1:20,000 [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR1"">1</xref>, <xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR2"">2</xref>]. PWS arises from lack of expression of paternally inherited imprinted genes on chromosome 15q11-q13 caused by a paternal deletion, maternal uniparental disomy 15 or an imprinting center defect, resulting in hypothalamic dysfunction [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR3"">3</xref>]. Clinical features of PWS include hypotonia and feeding difficulties in infancy and sustained accumulation of excess body fat beginning in early childhood [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR4"">4</xref>]. Hyperphagia, which occurs at a median age of 8 years, presents as food obsession, aggressive food seeking, and lack of satiety, with progression to severe obesity if energy intake is not restricted [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR4"">4</xref>]. PWS is also associated with intellectual disability, low muscle mass, neuroendocrine abnormalities including growth hormone and gonadotropin deficiency, behavioral problems including aggression, anxiety and compulsivity, and elevated risk for early mortality [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR5"">5</xref>–<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR7"">7</xref>]. According to surveys of caregivers of individuals with PWS, reducing hunger and improving food-related behaviors were the most important unmet needs in PWS that should be addressed in the development of a new therapeutic [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR8"">8</xref>, <xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR9"">9</xref>]. There are no effective treatments for hyperphagia or other behavioral problems in PWS, although several other investigational products have been evaluated in clinical studies [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR10"">10</xref>]. Diazoxide is a potent activator of the ATP-sensitive potassium (K<sub>ATP</sub>) channel and is capable of crossing the blood-brain barrier [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR11"">11</xref>]. Activating the K<sub>ATP</sub> channel in neuropeptide Y (NPY)/Agouti Related-Protein (AgRP) neurons in the hypothalamus results in reduced secretion of NPY and AgRP, potent endogenous appetite stimulatory neuropeptides, potentially contributing to a reduction in hyperphagia [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR12"">12</xref>]. These actions of the drug are complemented by activating the K<sub>ATP</sub> channel in the dorsal motor nucleus of the vagus nerve (amplification of the effects of insulin, leptin and alpha-melanocyte stimulating hormone on pancreatic function, insulin resistance and satiety), pancreatic β-cells (reductions in hyperinsulinemia), and adipocytes (reduction in fatty acid biosynthesis and increased beta-oxidation of fat) to reduce hyperinsulinemia and accumulation of excess body fat, and to improve insulin and leptin resistance, and satiety [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR12"">12</xref>]. These effects have been confirmed in multiple animal models of genetic or induced hyperphagic obesity including a model of PWS (Magel-2 null mouse) [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR12"">12</xref>]. Diazoxide choline extended release tablets (DCCR) is an extended-release tablet formulation of a highly soluble salt of diazoxide which upon administration results in release and absorption of active drug throughout the gastrointestinal tract over 24 h, contributing to very stable intraday circulating drug levels with once-per-day dosing. This study involves a comparison of a long-term interventional trial of DCCR in PWS (C601/C602) [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR13"">13</xref>, <xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR14"">14</xref>] to a natural history study. Natural history studies in rare diseases serve multiple purposes. First and foremost, they inform our understanding of the progression, complexity and burden of the rare disease. Secondly, provided there is comparability of enrolled subjects, and the same or similar endpoints are measured in the natural history study as are measured in interventional trials in the disease, then the natural history study may function as an appropriate and informative control cohort to the interventional study. In this role the natural history study has several advantages. Natural history studies tend to be larger than control arms in randomized studies, such that comparisons to the natural history study can be made with more power than might be achieved in the comparison to a placebo control arm. Natural history studies tend to be run longer than it may be feasible or ethical to run a placebo control arm in a randomized study, allowing for evaluation of efficacy over longer durations of administration of experimental drugs. Prospectively specifying a natural history study as the control to an interventional study likely allows the interventional study to be smaller since it does not include a placebo control arm. Consequently, the interventional study may recruit more quickly and be completed at lower cost. Finally, a single natural history study may serve as an appropriate control arm to multiple interventional studies. DESTINY PWS (C601) was a 13-week double-blind, placebo-controlled study in people with PWS age 4 and older comparing DCCR administration to placebo [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR13"">13</xref>]. In C601, using data obtained prior to the onset of the COVID19 pandemic, 13 weeks of treatment with DCCR resulted in significant improvements in hyperphagia as measured by the Hyperphagia Questionnaire for Clinical Trials (HQ-CT), in Clinical Global Impression of Improvement (CGI-I), in body fat, and in a range of other behavioral endpoints as measured by domains of the Prader-Willi Syndrome Profile (PWSP) Questionnaire [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR13"">13</xref>]. In the full dataset including data collected during the pandemic, the caregiver assessed endpoints including HQ-CT did not remain significant [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR13"">13</xref>]. C602 is an open label extension of the C601 study, which opened to participants upon completion of C601 [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR14"">14</xref>]. In this report, we compare caregiver-assessed behavioral outcomes in patients with PWS who were given DCCR in clinical trials (C601/C602) to findings of people with PWS who participated in an independent natural history study, the “Paving the way for Advances in Treatments and Health for PWS” (PATH for PWS) study. We hypothesized that hyperphagia and other aspects of behavior often observed in PWS would show improvements among those who were administered DCCR compared to those enrolled in the natural history study. Participants from two independent research cohorts were compared. DESTINY-PWS (C601; NCT03440814) was an international, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, Phase 3 study comparing DCCR to placebo in individuals with PWS age 4 years and older with hyperphagia. Dosing in this study was weight-based and targeted an average of 4.2 mg/kg [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR13"">13</xref>]. Following the completion of the double-blind study, participants who sought continued treatment with DCCR were eligible to enroll in clinical study C602 (NCT03714373), a long-term open-label treatment study [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR14"">14</xref>]. PATH for PWS (NCT03718416) is an ongoing natural history study, which enrolled individuals with PWS 5 years and older and was conducted by the Foundation for Prader-Willi Research (FPWR). The objectives of PATH for PWS include advancing the understanding of serious medical events in PWS over a 4-year period, as well as to evaluate how PWS related behaviors change over time. The data from this study are intended to inform the development of, and clinical trial designed for, potential new treatments for PWS. Prior to initiating each study (C601, C602 and PATH for PWS), ethics committee review and approval of the protocol and study related documents was completed. Protocols and study related materials for clinical studies C601 and C602 were reviewed and approved by the WCG Institutional Review Board. The protocol and study related materials for PATH for PWS were reviewed and approved by Hummingbird Institutional Review Board, and the study was subsequently overseen by the North Star Review Board. Participants or their parents/guardians provided informed consent and, as appropriate, assent, prior to being enrolled in each study. Participants in PATH for PWS were recruited concurrently with the recruitment of participants in C601, providing a contemporaneous population of individuals with PWS from which a cohort could be selected that is comparable to participants randomized in C601, to compare changes in behavior over time. A statistical Clinical Research Organization (CRO) independent of both Soleno and FPWR prepared and obtained approval from the sponsor for a statistical analysis plan (SAP) prior to the conduct of any analyses. The CRO utilized an unblinded biostatistician who identified participants for inclusion in the PATH for PWS cohort. Once the cohorts were identified and the SAP was approved the CRO was responsible for the analysis of the data. Data from clinical study C601 had already been unblinded, as had a portion of the data from the first 13 weeks of C602, but Soleno was blinded to most of the data from C602 prior to the start of statistical analysis for this comparison. A cohort of participants was identified by the statistical CRO from the PATH for PWS study, which met the key inclusion criteria for C601: baseline HQ-CT score ≥ 13, age 4 years and older, weight between 20 and 135 kg, not enrolled in an interventional clinical study at the first of two consecutive visits approximately 6 months apart with HQ-CT data available at both visits. Most of this cohort also had HQ-CT and data for other assessments available at a subsequent visit, which occurred approximately 1 year after the first visit. The HQ-CT is a 9-item (range 0–36), caregiver completed questionnaire intended to assess a range of hyperphagia-related behaviors in PWS over a 2-week recall period including: food seeking behaviors, tendency toward being upset or distressed when denied food or asked to stop talking about food and the extent to which these behaviors interfere with daily life [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR15"">15</xref>, <xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR16"">16</xref>]. The HQ-CT has been developed and validated for use in the assessment of hyperphagia related behaviors in clinical studies in PWS [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR13"">13</xref>, <xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR17"">17</xref>]. The PWSP is a caregiver completed questionnaire that assesses PWS-related behaviors including 51 items which comprise 6 behavioral domains: aggressive behaviors (9 items, range 0–18), anxiety (11 items, range 0–22), compulsivity (10 items, range 0–20), depression (5 items, range 0–10), disordered thinking (6 items, range 0–12) and rigidity/irritability (10 items, range 0–20) [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR18"">18</xref>]. It is intended for use in clinical trials. Baseline for participants in the C601/C602 cohort was defined as the last measurement of the parameter made prior to initiating DCCR administration. For participants in the DCCR arm of C601, baseline is the C601 baseline measurement, while for participants in the C601 placebo arm, baseline is the end-of-treatment measurement from C601. Hereafter, weeks refer to weeks of DCCR administration. The primary endpoint was HQ-CT change from baseline at 26 weeks. Additional endpoints included HQ-CT change from baseline at 52 weeks, HQ-CT change from baseline at 26 weeks by subgroup of age (< 18 years, ≥ 18 years), PWS genetic subtype (deletion, non-deletion), sex (female, male), growth hormone treatment status (use at both visits, no growth hormone use), and baseline HQ-CT total score (≥ 18, < 18), and changes in behavioral complications of PWS assessed using the PWSP at 26 and 52 weeks. All statistical tests were performed with a two-sided significance level of α = 0.05. Analyses were based on observed data without imputation for missing results. Comparability of the cohorts was assessed with respect to baseline and demographic characteristics. The primary comparison was the least square mean change from baseline in HQ-CT Total Score at Week 26 between the C601/C602 and the PATH for PWS cohorts from an analysis of covariance model adjusting for baseline HQ-CT Total Score and cohort. Subgroup analyses of HQ-CT change from Baseline were based on an analysis of covariance model adjusting for baseline HQ-CT Total Score and cohort. In addition, all available HQ-CT scores through Week 52 were analyzed using a mixed model for repeated measures with unstructured covariance, baseline HQ-CT, and post-baseline timepoint with an interaction term between cohort and post-baseline timepoint. A sensitivity analysis was conducted in which each missing HQ-CT assessment in the C601/C602 cohort was imputed with the highest possible score for the HQ-CT, including individuals missing data at both 26 and 52 weeks, and would not have been included in the analysis of the primary endpoint (an HQ-CT score of 36, i.e., the worst-case scenario). The resulting dataset was analyzed using the same mixed model for repeated measures as was used for the observed cases. PWSP domains were compared between cohorts based on the Mann-Whitney test. The domains of the PWSP at Week 26 and at Week 52 were also analyzed similarly to the primary ANCOVA for the HQ-CT total Score at Week 26, using their respective baseline scores as covariates. The lack of randomization when comparing with observational cohorts may result in large differences or imbalances in the values of their respective baseline covariates that can create biased estimates of treatment effects. A methodology used to overcome such biases is the use of propensity scores. Several covariates that have been thought to affect the efficacy outcome as based on scientific rationale or known to influence efficacy as demonstrated in previous studies are considered for inclusion in propensity scores. These propensity scores are then incorporated in the statistical analysis in lieu of multiple covariates. Propensity scores combine all the information from the covariates into a single number that represents the probability of being assigned to the treatment given the covariates. A subset of subjects with similar propensity scores will tend to be similar with respect to values of the baseline and demographic characteristic. Propensity score adjusted ANCOVA analyses were also conducted. Propensity scores were derived from a logistic regression model adjusting for age, gender, baseline weight (kg), baseline HQ-CT, growth hormone treatment status (on treatment vs. not), region (US vs. Outside the US [OUS]), and PWS genetic type (deletion vs. non-deletion). Given the concurrent recruitment in the same or similar geographic regions and the use of the same age, weight and HQ-CT inclusion criteria, there was an expectation that the individuals in the two cohorts would be receiving a similar standard of care, and have similar durations of disease and disease severity, limiting the potential for introduction of a bias from these sources in the analysis. From May 2018 through January 2020, 127 participants were randomized in C601 (Fig. <xref rid=""Fig1"" ref-type=""fig"">1</xref>). One hundred twenty participants completed C601 and 115 enrolled in C602. Data at 26 weeks was available for 114 participants. Recruitment for PATH for PWS was initiated in October 2018 and had reached the target of about 700 participants by the time recruitment was completed for C601. Five hundred forty-three participants in PATH for PWS had data on HQ-CT from two consecutive visits approximately 6 months apart. Of these, 303 participants did not meet the inclusion criteria for age, baseline HQ-CT score or weight, and a further 11 participants were concurrently enrolled in an interventional clinical study at baseline or post-baseline (Fig. <xref rid=""Fig1"" ref-type=""fig"">1</xref>). Consequently, the cohort from PATH for PWS consisted of 229 participants. Of these 229 participants in PATH for PWS, 197 also had data available at approximately 52 weeks. Demographic and baseline characteristics for the two cohorts are presented in Table <xref rid=""Tab1"" ref-type=""table"">1</xref>. The two cohorts are comparable, with the primary differences between the cohorts being that the PATH for PWS cohort was slightly older, and, consequently, had somewhat lower rates of growth hormone treatment, and incrementally lower baseline HQ-CT scores. Thus, the PATH for PWS cohort was deemed to effectively serve as an external natural history control for the cohort from C601/C602.

 Compared to the natural history of PWS as exemplified by the PATH for PWS cohort, the DCCR cohort had improved hyperphagia, the hallmark of PWS, measured by the HQ-CT at both 26 weeks and 52 weeks in the whole population and in all subgroup analyses at 26 weeks. Similar magnitudes of improvement in HQ-CT in the C601/C602 cohort compared to the PATH for PWS cohort were realized in both pediatric and adult participants, in females and males, and in growth hormone treated and naïve subgroups. Consistent with the results of C601 and in long-term treatment with DCCR in C601/C602, greater improvements relative to the natural history of PWS were realized with DCCR in those with more severe hyperphagia at baseline [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR13"">13</xref>]. The observed improvements in hyperphagia relative to the natural history of PWS likely resulted from the combination of the direct effects of DCCR in NPY/AgRP neurons and from improvements in insulin and leptin resistance [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR11"">11</xref>]. The magnitude of improvement in HQ-CT at 26 weeks in this analysis was greater than that observed at 13 weeks in C601 [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR13"">13</xref>]. The comparison between cohorts remains significant, even when all missing values including those for subjects in the C601/C602 cohort that were missing both the 26 week and 52 week measurements, were assigned the highest possible score for HQ-CT (the worst case scenario), confirming the robustness of the results. Strengths of this study include the contemporaneous accrual of participants who completed the same measures in the DCCR C601/C602 studies and the natural history PATH for PWS study. Limitations are primarily related to the fact that there was open-label administration of DCCR in C602, potentially allowing improvements to be ascribed to the drug when they were primarily due to being in an interventional, rather than an observational, study, and the secondary nature of this analysis of two independent cohorts. DCCR administration in C601/C602 resulted in broad-ranging impacts on PWS-associated behaviors as measured using the PWSP, with the comparison of change from baseline in DCCR participants in C601/C602 to the results from PATH for PWS being significant for all domains at both 26 and 52 weeks. Improvements in anxiety, compulsivity, aggressive behaviors, rigidity/irritability, disordered thinking and depression were observed with DCCR administration relative to the natural history of PWS. These results suggest that DCCR administration to participants with PWS improves the most important behavioral complications of the condition relative to the natural history of the disease. DCCR administration resulted in changes in hyperphagia and other behavioral complications of PWS that are significantly improved from the natural history of the syndrome as exemplified by the cohort from PATH for PWS. The combined effects of long-term administration of DCCR should reduce the burden of the syndrome on the patient, caregivers and their families, and thereby may benefit people with PWS and their families.",N/A,26 4 2024
"Postural-motor development, spinal range of movement and caregiver burden in Prader-Willi syndrome-associated scoliosis: an observational study","Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) is a rare genetic disorder characterized by hypothalamic dysfunction, hypotonia, cognitive deficits, and hyperphagia, primarily resulting from genetic abnormalities on chromosome 15. Among its varied manifestations, musculoskeletal issues, notably scoliosis, pose important challenges in management. This study aims to investigate differences in postural-motor development and spinal range of movement between preadolescents and adolescents with PWS, with and without scoliosis, while also exploring the potential impact of scoliosis on caregiving burden, an aspect yet to be thoroughly explored in existing literature. This observational study evaluated 13 individuals diagnosed with PWS, including 5 with scoliosis (PWS-Sc) and 7 without (PWS-NSc). Inclusion criteria comprised ages 8 to 18 years, confirmed PWS diagnosis through genetic testing, and scoliosis diagnosis. Anamnestic data, physical examinations, and surface measurements were collected, along with parental burden assessments using the Zarit Burden Interview (ZBI). Both groups displayed delays in achieving postural-motor milestones, with the PWS-Sc group exhibiting a more pronounced delay, although statistical significance was not achieved. The main curve magnitude in the PWS-Sc group averaged 31.5° Cobb, with 60% of cases presenting an S-shaped curve. Surface measurements of physiological curves did not differ significantly between groups, but the scoliosis-affected group exhibited lower lumbar extension values (p=0.04). The overall ZBI revealed higher scores in the PWS-Sc group, although statistical significance was not reached. However, significant differences were observed in single questions score evaluating aspects such as social life and caregiver uncertainty (p=0.04 and p=0.03, respectively). Despite the small sample size, delays in achieving postural-motor milestones, particularly in individuals with scoliosis, were observed. The differences recorded in lumbo-pelvic movement suggest that tailored interventions may be beneficial. The heightened caregiving burden in the scoliosis group underscores the need for targeted support. Early intervention and ongoing monitoring should be important for accurate diagnosis and appropriate care, potentially with psychological support for caregivers.","  Prader-Willi Syndrome (PWS) is a genetic disorder characterized by various physical, cognitive, and behavioral manifestations, and understanding its multifaceted impact is essential for addressing the challenges faced by individuals with PWS and their caregivers. Scoliosis is one of the major concerns for PWS patients and therefore there is a need for regular systematic monitoring of spinal deformity from pediatric age.<sup><xref rid=""ref19"" ref-type=""bibr"">19</xref></sup> The findings of our study confirm a delay in achieving postural-motor developmental milestones among individuals with PWS, consistent with existing literature.<sup><xref rid=""ref20"" ref-type=""bibr"">20-22</xref></sup> Monotonous early motor and verbal behaviors in infants with PWS have been reported.<sup><xref rid=""ref22"" ref-type=""bibr"">22</xref></sup> Monitoring milestones achievements and verbal behaviors in infants with PWS may reveal specific patterns and precursors of later development.<sup><xref rid=""ref22"" ref-type=""bibr"">22</xref></sup> In our study the PW-Sc subgroup exhibited a more pronounced delay, suggesting potential factors such as increased axial hypotonia or impaired axial coordination and proprioception.<sup><xref rid=""ref14"" ref-type=""bibr"">14</xref></sup> Moreover, surface measurements of dynamic spine ROM revealed a notable reduction in lumbar extension in the scoliosis group. This reduction may be attributed to a deficit in core muscle strength during trunk extension.<sup><xref rid=""ref23"" ref-type=""bibr"">23</xref></sup> These alterations are documented in the literature to persist into adulthood. Adults with PWS exhibit increased thoracic kyphosis but reduced lumbar lordosis, along with diminished movements in lumbar flexion, lumbar extension, lumbar lateral flexion, and hip flexion and extension compared to those with normal weight.<sup><xref rid=""ref24"" ref-type=""bibr"">24</xref></sup> Therefore, early recognition of these limitations can enable interventions with appropriate exercise programs to enhance trunk mobility. In addition, exercises for postural control in the sagittal plane should also be recommended. Encouraging activities that enhance core muscle control, such as swimming, dancing, or gymnastics, may also be beneficial.<sup><xref rid=""ref9"" ref-type=""bibr"">9</xref></sup> The limitations in mobility can also translate into a higher psychological burden on the caregivers of these patients. Caregivers of individuals with PWS can face a substantial burden, emphasizing the need for targeted support strategies. All participants in our study scored above 20 points on the ZBI, with a mean ZBI score of 41.81 points. According to developers, a score of 20 is the threshold for requiring support. Notably, in our study caregivers of PWS scoliosis subjects scored higher averages across several domains, highlighting areas of increased concern, particularly in the personal and relational spheres. The concomitant differences in gender distribution between the two groups do not allow definitive conclusions on whether scoliosis determined the increased caregiving burden, contributed to it, or was incidental. However, this study identified key areas requiring monitoring and intervention, emphasizing the need for targeted support for caregivers of individuals with PWS, particularly those developing scoliosis. Kayadjanian <italic toggle=""yes"">et al.</italic> reported that caregivers of individuals with PWS experienced a significant burden, with an average ZBI score of 44.4±15.4. Higher scores were noted for caregivers of teenagers and young adults with PWS, while lower scores were observed for older adults and the youngest age group. Caregivers reported negative impacts on their romantic relationships, work, sleep, and mood due to caring for someone with PWS. Interestingly, caregiver burden in PWS appeared to be independent of income level and was weakly correlated with the amount of assistance received. Notably, caregiver burden in PWS exceeded that observed in caregivers for conditions such as dementia and traumatic brain injury.<sup><xref rid=""ref18"" ref-type=""bibr"">18</xref></sup> Our findings reconfirm the need for interventions to alleviate caregiver burden, which could serve as a secondary endpoint in treating PWS. It should be advisable in clinical practice to screen caregiver burden, identifying cases of greater need and guiding caregivers to competent professionals addressing critical areas.<sup><xref rid=""ref25"" ref-type=""bibr"">25</xref></sup> This screening should be particularly needed when proposing interventions that may impact family dynamics, such as prescribing a brace for conservative scoliosis treatment.<sup><xref rid=""ref26"" ref-type=""bibr"">26</xref></sup> However, some limitations should be acknowledged. In our population, patients with obesity were poorly represented. Increasing the sample size and monitoring over time could help evaluate the influence of obesity on the clinical history of scoliosis and musculoskeletal alterations in general. In addition, the sample size was relatively small in our study, limiting the generalizability of the findings. To confirm obtained data, future research should focus on expanding the sample size, adopting a longitudinal approach, and collaborating with pediatric endocrinology and relevant associations to further investigate the impact of musculoskeletal alterations on caregiving burdens. Continued interdisciplinary collaboration should be prioritized for the global management of individuals with PWS, guiding intervention strategies and support programs tailored for these subjects. Our study highlighted the potential interplay between PWS, scoliosis, and the associated caregiving burden. Our findings, despite the small sample size, indicate a significant delay in achieving postural-motor milestones in individuals with PWS, particularly in those with scoliosis. Lumbo-pelvic movement analysis revealed differences in extension, suggesting potential implications for core muscle training programs in scoliosis-affected individuals. Finally, the caregiving burden was higher in the scoliosis group, emphasizing the need for targeted support programs. Therefore, the study underscored the importance of considering early intervention and long-term monitoring in this patient population to make a correct diagnosis and offer appropriate care, enhancing the well-being of individuals with PWS. Alleviating the caregiving burden on families may require psychological support for caregivers. Therefore, continued collaboration among diverse medical specialties and professional figures should be necessary for a comprehensive and effective PWS management approach.",N/A,22 4 2024
A Case Report of Acute Saddle Pulmonary Embolism in Prader-Willi Syndrome,"Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) is an exceedingly rare congenital syndrome of chromosome 15 that presents multiple comorbidities in said individuals. The associated quality of life for those with the disease is often severely diminished; more tragically, mortality associated with the disease is also increased. Pulmonary embolism (PE) is highly associated with mortality and has been shown to be more prevalent in patients with PWS. This case report details a patient with PWS who survived an acute saddle PE and looks to bring more clinical knowledge that can be applied when dealing with individuals with PWS.","Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) is a sporadic genetic syndrome due to methylation at 15q11.2-q13 [<xref rid=""REF1"" ref-type=""bibr"">1</xref>,<xref rid=""REF2"" ref-type=""bibr"">2</xref>]. This genetic mutation has multiple ramifications for the human system, but it also has classical characteristics such as hypogonadism, morbid obesity, hyperphagia, and restrictions in growth and cognition [<xref rid=""REF1"" ref-type=""bibr"">1</xref>,<xref rid=""REF2"" ref-type=""bibr"">2</xref>]. These symptoms, especially morbid obesity, cause drastic changes in the quality of life of individuals with PWS; the average life expectancy of a PWS patient is roughly 30 years [<xref rid=""REF3"" ref-type=""bibr"">3</xref>]. Furthermore, most deaths associated with PWS are due to respiratory failure [<xref rid=""REF3"" ref-type=""bibr"">3</xref>]. However, pulmonary embolism (PE) makes up a significant portion of the deaths related to PWS [<xref rid=""REF3"" ref-type=""bibr"">3</xref>]. PE is a life-threatening situation in any demographic; it should be noted that individuals with PWS are particularly at risk due to the comorbidities of the condition (obesity) [<xref rid=""REF3"" ref-type=""bibr"">3</xref>]. This case report looks at an interesting case of an individual with PWS who presented with characteristic findings of an acute saddle PE and was treated successfully. The patient in this case report was a 41-year-old male with a past medical history of PWS and morbid obesity who presented to the emergency department via emergency medical services (EMS) with a chief complaint of shortness of breath and general malaise. The patient also had a prior diagnosis of adrenal insufficiency and took chronic steroid therapy as his treatment. The patient’s parents were his primary caregivers, and he expressed that he had had these symptoms for over two weeks, but his shortness of breath had exacerbated over the two days before his arrival at the ED. The patient was brought into the ED via EMS, which reported that his oxygen saturation was stable at 92%. Upon physical examination, vitals included a blood pressure of 144/83, a temperature of 36.8°C, a heart rate of 99, and a respiration rate of 18/min. Both parents discussed that his basic daily movements of just “walking around” resulted in him having diaphoresis, lightheadedness, and fainting episodes. The mother of the patient stated that the patient did participate in exercise and made efforts to live a healthy lifestyle but had not recently due to his worsening condition. Upon further questioning, the patient denied alcohol or tobacco use, nausea, vomiting, hemoptysis, calf pain, or abdominal tenderness. The patient endorsed a dry cough, shortness of breath, and profuse diaphoresis; he had no gross visual unilateral swelling in his lower extremities. A triage EKG showed benign findings, with no sinus tachycardia, ST elevation, or right bundle branch block (Figure <xref rid=""FIG1"" ref-type=""fig"">1</xref>). He was started on a nasal cannula to support his oxygenation and dyspnea with 1 L of oxygen. Upon further evaluation of said symptoms, a lead diagnosis of PE was made. Utilizing the PERC-Wells criteria, the patient was not able to be “PERC’d” out, and a preliminary order of tests including a chest X-ray and corresponding blood work of the complete blood count, comprehensive metabolic panel, d-dimer, n-terminal proBNP (BNP), and troponin cardiac markers were quickly ordered (Table <xref rid=""TAB1"" ref-type=""table"">1</xref>). A chest X-ray was performed and showed a finding of prominence in the hilar region, an elevated right dome, and atelectasis in the right mid-lung (Figure <xref rid=""FIG2"" ref-type=""fig"">2</xref>). The D-dimer markers were significantly elevated at 14.93 uG/mL, and BNP was also at 3,026 pg/mL. Upon collection and evaluation of these lab markers, a CT pulmonary angiogram and a lower extremity ultrasound were urgently ordered. The attending radiologist of the CT imaging marked critical findings and remarked that there were extensive bilateral pulmonary emboli in the distal main pulmonary arteries (Figure <xref rid=""FIG3"" ref-type=""fig"">3</xref>); furthermore, the pulmonary artery was dilated at 3.9 cm, and the right ventricle to left ventricle ratio was 1.5 (greater than 1 indicates right heart strain). A lower extremity ultrasound also found a deep vein thrombosis (DVT) in the proximal left popliteal vein (Figure <xref rid=""FIG4"" ref-type=""fig"">4</xref>). Due to these imaging findings, the patient was immediately started on a heparin drip (25,000 units), per PE hospital protocol. Due to the emergent situation of the patient’s findings, interventional radiology (IR) was consulted, and the patient was discussed. The attending IR physician agreed to take the patient based on the CT findings that showed the right heart strain and pulmonary artery dilation. The patient was transferred to IR for a catheter-directed thrombolysis (EKOS) procedure in which tissue plasminogen activator and embolectomy were used to remove the emboli. The patient tolerated the procedure well and was sent to the intensive care unit for observation. A few days later, the patient was discharged after a successful recovery. The patient was not followed after discharge. Pulmonary emboli, when significantly large, as in the case of this patient, can oftentimes be fatal if misdiagnosed or if treatment is delayed. It is essential to understand the dynamics of the problem and why there seems to be a high rate of PEs in this demographic. It should be noted that this patient’s age is beyond the life expectancy of individuals with PWS [<xref rid=""REF2"" ref-type=""bibr"">2</xref>]. Patients affected by PWS are characteristically obese, and numerous metabolic pathologies such as hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and hypercholesterolemia are closely associated [<xref rid=""REF4"" ref-type=""bibr"">4</xref>]. It can be concluded that obesity is the most significant contributor to the morbidity of patients with PWS, with cardiovascular disease having a close associational component [<xref rid=""REF5"" ref-type=""bibr"">5</xref>]. Obesity is linked to venous thrombi, and as a result, PE is a common finding in this demographic [<xref rid=""REF4"" ref-type=""bibr"">4</xref>]. Anecdotally, the patient’s parents and caregivers expressed that the patient exercises continuously and consistently and was treated and cared for by a significant state-affiliated academic hospital; however, upon further review of the patient’s medicine records, no findings of growth hormone were made. This is significant as growth hormone is a treatment that is often used in the PWS population, and growth hormone is also linked to venous thrombi [<xref rid=""REF5"" ref-type=""bibr"">5</xref>]. Literature has found that even with lifestyle modifications, patients with PWS are still affected by morbid obesity [<xref rid=""REF6"" ref-type=""bibr"">6</xref>], and often drastic measures such as bariatric surgery are used to help control the driving force of obesity, which is unsuppressed appetite [<xref rid=""REF7"" ref-type=""bibr"">7</xref>]. Research is currently limited in the scope of the correlation of why death via PE is prominent in individuals with PWS; more research regarding the correlation should be studied as it is one of the leading causes of death in patients with PWS [<xref rid=""REF4"" ref-type=""bibr"">4</xref>]. Chest X-rays are not usually used as a screening pattern for PEs due to their low sensitivity for PE. However, they are routinely used to rule out other processes such as pneumonia, tension pneumothorax, or even tuberculosis. The attending physician made a clinical judgment due to the knowledge that atelectasis is a possible finding with PE [<xref rid=""REF8"" ref-type=""bibr"">8</xref>]. Another interesting finding was the presentation of the individual; the patient presented with no apparent unilateral leg swelling, which is often indicative of DVT [<xref rid=""REF9"" ref-type=""bibr"">9</xref>], although ultrasound testing later confirmed DVT. Sinus tachycardia, S1Q3T3, and right bundle branch block [<xref rid=""REF10"" ref-type=""bibr"">10</xref>], described as hallmark PE findings, were not noted in this patient, even though the CTA showed pulmonary artery hypertension or dilation. Manzardo et al. concluded that DVTs are prominent in the PWS population, and the same comorbidities (obesity) that affect the general population are also associated with PWS patients [<xref rid=""REF11"" ref-type=""bibr"">11</xref>]. It can be deduced that the patients are more likely to be exposed to PE due to the obesity associated with the syndrome. Matesevac et al. have also conducted a study that has strengthened the point that PEs and DVTs are more likely to be found in the PWS patient population than in the general population [<xref rid=""REF12"" ref-type=""bibr"">12</xref>]. Regardless of this information, much more evidence is needed to understand why pulmonary embolus is associated with this demographic; it can be speculated that obesity and medications (hormone replacement) may be contributing factors to the incidence of PE in the PWS population. This case report highlights the importance of clinical manifestations of PE and how clinical judgment should be used when assessing patients for possible PE, even when characteristic findings such as chest pain, sinus tachycardia, shortness of breath, and unilateral leg swelling are absent. PE has many presentations, some more common than others, and all clinicians are urged to be aware of these patterns, as they can mask themselves very well. However, more importantly, given the rarity of PWS and the characteristics of the population, this article’s authors believe more case reports on PWS and its associations with PE may contribute great value to medical knowledge. The authors believe that X-rays, although not used as first-line tests for clinical suspicion of PE, should still be used in clinical decision-making. However, a good history and physician exam are much more significant, and emphasis should be placed on collecting a good history; this is often difficult given the demanding time constraints of the emergency departments nationwide. Although it can be assumed with clinical reasoning that obesity is the strongest culprit, more evidence is needed in this demographic to make a strong claim. The authors of this report urge clinicians to continue to be judicious when dealing with patients who come in for dyspnea and to remain vigilant when classic hallmark findings are absent but clinical gestalt “feels” otherwise.",N/A,2 4 2024
