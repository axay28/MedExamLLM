Comprehensive High-Depth Proteomic Analysis of Plasma Extracellular Vesicles Containing Preparations in Rett Syndrome,"<bold>Backgroud:</bold> Rett syndrome is a neurodevelopmental disorder that affects 1 in 10,000 females. Various treatments have been explored; however, no effective treatments have been reported to date, except for trofinetide, a synthetic analog of glycine-proline-glutamic acid, which was approved by the FDA in 2023. Serological biomarkers that correlate with the disease status of RTT are needed to promote early diagnosis and to develop novel agents. <bold>Methods:</bold> In this study, we performed a high-depth proteomic analysis of extracellular vesicles containing preparations extracted from patient plasma samples to identify novel biomarkers. <bold>Results:</bold> We identified 33 upregulated and 17 downregulated candidate proteins among a total of 4273 proteins in RTT compared to the healthy controls. Among these, UBE3B was predominantly increased in patients with Rett syndrome and exhibited a strong correlation with the clinical severity score, indicating the severity of the disease. <bold>Conclusions:</bold> We demonstrated that the proteomics of high-depth extracellular vesicles containing preparations in rare diseases could be valuable in identifying new disease biomarkers and understanding their pathophysiology.","Rett syndrome (RTT) is a neurodevelopmental disorder affecting 1 in 10000 live female births [<xref rid=""B1-biomedicines-12-02172"" ref-type=""bibr"">1</xref>]. Patients normally develop RTT within 6 to 18 months of age, after which motor function and communication skills begin to decline, causing repetitive hand movements, such as wringing, clapping, and washing. Patients may experience a loss of coordinated hand movements, which can progress to severe physical dysfunction and necessitate wheelchair dependence in some cases [<xref rid=""B2-biomedicines-12-02172"" ref-type=""bibr"">2</xref>]. Complications of RTT include microcephaly in 80% of cases [<xref rid=""B3-biomedicines-12-02172"" ref-type=""bibr"">3</xref>], gait disturbance in 80% [<xref rid=""B4-biomedicines-12-02172"" ref-type=""bibr"">4</xref>], epilepsy in 60.8% [<xref rid=""B5-biomedicines-12-02172"" ref-type=""bibr"">5</xref>], and scoliosis in 85%, with 13% of these cases requiring surgery [<xref rid=""B6-biomedicines-12-02172"" ref-type=""bibr"">6</xref>,<xref rid=""B7-biomedicines-12-02172"" ref-type=""bibr"">7</xref>]. Abdominal disorders, such as gastroesophageal reflux and air swallowing with abdominal distention, are also common and sometimes serious [<xref rid=""B8-biomedicines-12-02172"" ref-type=""bibr"">8</xref>]. Autonomic symptoms, such as breathing dysregulation characterized by both hyperventilation and breath holding, as well as the dysregulation of temperature in the extremities, have also been identified as specific findings of RTT [<xref rid=""B9-biomedicines-12-02172"" ref-type=""bibr"">9</xref>]. <italic toggle=""yes"">Methyl-CpG-binding protein2</italic> (<italic toggle=""yes"">MECP2</italic>) gene abnormality on chromosome Xq28 has been reported as a typical causative factor for RTT, being reported in approximately 90% of patients [<xref rid=""B10-biomedicines-12-02172"" ref-type=""bibr"">10</xref>,<xref rid=""B11-biomedicines-12-02172"" ref-type=""bibr"">11</xref>,<xref rid=""B12-biomedicines-12-02172"" ref-type=""bibr"">12</xref>]. The Human Gene Mutation database identifies 555 <italic toggle=""yes"">MECP2</italic> mutations associated with RTT; however, 70% of patients with RTT with <italic toggle=""yes"">MECP2</italic> gene abnormalities have mutations in R106W, R133C, T158M, R168X, R255X, R270X, R294X, and R306C [<xref rid=""B12-biomedicines-12-02172"" ref-type=""bibr"">12</xref>,<xref rid=""B13-biomedicines-12-02172"" ref-type=""bibr"">13</xref>]. <italic toggle=""yes"">MECP2</italic> variations have not been identified in approximately 3–5% of cases meeting the clinical diagnostic criteria for RTT [<xref rid=""B12-biomedicines-12-02172"" ref-type=""bibr"">12</xref>]. Additionally, these variations have been reported in autism [<xref rid=""B14-biomedicines-12-02172"" ref-type=""bibr"">14</xref>] and Angelman syndrome [<xref rid=""B15-biomedicines-12-02172"" ref-type=""bibr"">15</xref>]. Therefore, the presence of an <italic toggle=""yes"">MECP2</italic> mutation does not definitively indicate RTT. In order to diagnose typical or classic RTT, it is necessary to observe the following: (1) a period of regression followed by recovery or stabilization, (2) all main criteria and all exclusion criteria, And (3) supportive criteria, which are not required, although often present in typical RTT. The main criteria are as follows: (1) partial or complete loss of acquired purposeful hand skills, (2) partial or complete loss of acquired spoken language, (3) gait abnormalities, including impaired ability (dyspraxic) or the absence of ability, And (4) stereotypic hand movements, such as hand wringing/squeezing, clapping/tapping, mouthing and washing/rubbing automatisms. The exclusion criteria are as follows: (1) a brain injury secondary to trauma (peri- or postnatally), neurometabolic disease, or severe infection that causes neurological problems and (2) grossly abnormal psychomotor development in the first 6 months of life [<xref rid=""B9-biomedicines-12-02172"" ref-type=""bibr"">9</xref>]. It has been documented that 70% of patients diagnosed with typical or classic RTT survive to the age of 45 [<xref rid=""B16-biomedicines-12-02172"" ref-type=""bibr"">16</xref>]. Various drugs and treatments have been tested for RTT, including ketogenic diets [<xref rid=""B17-biomedicines-12-02172"" ref-type=""bibr"">17</xref>], naltrexone [<xref rid=""B18-biomedicines-12-02172"" ref-type=""bibr"">18</xref>], omega-3 fatty acids [<xref rid=""B19-biomedicines-12-02172"" ref-type=""bibr"">19</xref>,<xref rid=""B20-biomedicines-12-02172"" ref-type=""bibr"">20</xref>], triheptanoin [<xref rid=""B21-biomedicines-12-02172"" ref-type=""bibr"">21</xref>], folinic acid [<xref rid=""B22-biomedicines-12-02172"" ref-type=""bibr"">22</xref>,<xref rid=""B23-biomedicines-12-02172"" ref-type=""bibr"">23</xref>,<xref rid=""B24-biomedicines-12-02172"" ref-type=""bibr"">24</xref>], lovastatin [<xref rid=""B25-biomedicines-12-02172"" ref-type=""bibr"">25</xref>], cerebrolysine [<xref rid=""B26-biomedicines-12-02172"" ref-type=""bibr"">26</xref>], fingolimod [<xref rid=""B27-biomedicines-12-02172"" ref-type=""bibr"">27</xref>], and IGF-1 [<xref rid=""B28-biomedicines-12-02172"" ref-type=""bibr"">28</xref>,<xref rid=""B29-biomedicines-12-02172"" ref-type=""bibr"">29</xref>]. However, no effective treatments have been reported to date, except for trofinetide, a synthetic analog of glycine-proline-glutamic acid, which was approved by the FDA for patients suffering from RTT [<xref rid=""B30-biomedicines-12-02172"" ref-type=""bibr"">30</xref>,<xref rid=""B31-biomedicines-12-02172"" ref-type=""bibr"">31</xref>]. We believe that there are treatments to prevent and treat RTT symptoms. This belief is based on the observation that, while increased cell packing density and decreased dendrites occur in the neurons of patients with RTT, neuronal loss or apparent gliosis is not observed [<xref rid=""B32-biomedicines-12-02172"" ref-type=""bibr"">32</xref>]. In an experiment using conditional knock-in mice, <italic toggle=""yes"">MECP2</italic> function was restored in Floxed Stop/Y mice, which developed RTT-like symptoms at approximately 4–6 weeks and died around 10 weeks. However, tamoxifen alleviated neurological and respiratory symptoms and extended their lifespan to 30 weeks or longer [<xref rid=""B33-biomedicines-12-02172"" ref-type=""bibr"">33</xref>]. The loss of MECP2 protein did not lead to cytotoxicity, suggesting that the restoration of <italic toggle=""yes"">MECP2</italic> gene function or the replacement of MECP2 protein could potentially alleviate the symptoms of RTT. As mentioned above, RTT can only be diagnosed clinically; that is, it can only be diagnosed after the symptoms have progressed to a certain degree. Therefore, significant attempts have been made to identify the biomarkers for early treatment. Various EEG parameters [<xref rid=""B23-biomedicines-12-02172"" ref-type=""bibr"">23</xref>,<xref rid=""B29-biomedicines-12-02172"" ref-type=""bibr"">29</xref>,<xref rid=""B34-biomedicines-12-02172"" ref-type=""bibr"">34</xref>,<xref rid=""B35-biomedicines-12-02172"" ref-type=""bibr"">35</xref>], plethysmographic parameters, autonomic indices, and blood-based oxidative stress markers have been reported as possible biomarkers [<xref rid=""B19-biomedicines-12-02172"" ref-type=""bibr"">19</xref>,<xref rid=""B29-biomedicines-12-02172"" ref-type=""bibr"">29</xref>,<xref rid=""B36-biomedicines-12-02172"" ref-type=""bibr"">36</xref>]. However, most of them remain secondary or exploratory indicators owing to their unknown functional significance. Thus far, no effective biomarkers have been established to evaluate disease status. A proteomic analysis using fibroblasts from patients with RTT and healthy controls has provided insights into protein alterations related to the mitochondrial network [<xref rid=""B37-biomedicines-12-02172"" ref-type=""bibr"">37</xref>]. Therefore, we performed a proteomic analysis of extracellular vesicles containing preparations (EVs-cp) in the plasma of patients with RTT to identify proteins that could serve as new biomarkers. Extracellular vesicles are defined as particles that are released from cells, that are delimited by a lipid bilayer, and that cannot replicate on their own according to MISEV (Minimal Information for Studies of Extracellular Vesicles) guidelines “<uri http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink href=""https://www.isev.org/misev"">https://www.isev.org/misev</uri> (accessed on 24 March 2024)”. Extracellular vesicles can cross the cerebrovascular barrier and are considered potential biomarkers for central nervous system diseases. The rationale for focusing on extracellular vesicles is that, recently, studies focused on identifying new biomarkers by analyzing extracellular vesicles, including exosomes, have been successfully conducted [<xref rid=""B38-biomedicines-12-02172"" ref-type=""bibr"">38</xref>]. It was postulated that a comparable investigation of extracellular vesicles or EVs-cp in Rett syndrome might yield a novel biomarker. Using high-depth data-independent acquisition (DIA), we successfully identified over 2000 proteins. Subsequently, a novel candidate biomarker protein, UBE3B, was identified.  A total of 4273 proteins were identified by performing an in-depth DIA proteome analysis of plasma collected from 12 participants (six patients with RTT and six NCs) (<xref rid=""biomedicines-12-02172-t001"" ref-type=""table"">Table 1</xref>, <xref rid=""app1-biomedicines-12-02172"" ref-type=""app"">Figure S1, and Table S2</xref>). An enrichment analysis of the identified proteins revealed extracellular vesicles containing proteins, confirming successful extraction (<xref rid=""biomedicines-12-02172-f001"" ref-type=""fig"">Figure 1</xref>A and <xref rid=""app1-biomedicines-12-02172"" ref-type=""app"">Table S3</xref>). The proteins were analyzed using Perseus ver. 2.011, and 2712 were selected based on the criteria that they were detected with two or more unique peptides in over 70% of the samples from either the RTT group or NC group. We investigated the degree of overlap between the proteins extracted in our experiments, those identified by the CS-based isolation method most extensively documented by Lin Cao et al. [<xref rid=""B43-biomedicines-12-02172"" ref-type=""bibr"">43</xref>], and those in one of the most reliable and utilized databases of EV, namely the Vesiclepedia database, version 5.1, “<uri http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink href=""http://microvesicles.org/index.html"">http://microvesicles.org/index.html</uri> (accessed on 5 September 2024)” [<xref rid=""B44-biomedicines-12-02172"" ref-type=""bibr"">44</xref>]. From the protein/mRNA data in the Vesiclepedia database, we extracted only those entries corresponding to humans as the animal species and protein as the molecular species. The extracted proteins were further extracted from the DAVID database, version 2024q2, “<uri http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink href=""https://david.ncifcrf.gov/home.jsp"">https://david.ncifcrf.gov/home.jsp</uri> (accessed on 5 September 2024)”. A comparison was conducted between the proteins extracted in the present study, those extracted by Lin Cao et al. [<xref rid=""B43-biomedicines-12-02172"" ref-type=""bibr"">43</xref>], and those listed in the Vesiclepedia database [<xref rid=""B44-biomedicines-12-02172"" ref-type=""bibr"">44</xref>] (<xref rid=""biomedicines-12-02172-f001"" ref-type=""fig"">Figure 1</xref>B). A total of 77.5% of the extracted proteins in Lin Cao et al.’s study [<xref rid=""B43-biomedicines-12-02172"" ref-type=""bibr"">43</xref>] were matched with the present study, while 3777 proteins (representing 88% of the total) were matched with the Vesiclepedia database [<xref rid=""B44-biomedicines-12-02172"" ref-type=""bibr"">44</xref>]. This indicates that the extracted proteins in the present study are likely to contain extracellular vesicles. However, many proteins (452 proteins, representing 10.5% of the total) not listed in Vesiclepedia [<xref rid=""B44-biomedicines-12-02172"" ref-type=""bibr"">44</xref>] were also detected compared to the results of the experiment by Lin Cao et al. [<xref rid=""B43-biomedicines-12-02172"" ref-type=""bibr"">43</xref>] (31 proteins, representing 1.4% of the total). For this reason, we describe the proteins we extracted in this experiment as EVs-cp. An F-test was performed, and no equal variances were found between the two groups. Therefore, the differences between the two groups were determined using Welch’s <italic toggle=""yes"">t</italic>-test (<xref rid=""app1-biomedicines-12-02172"" ref-type=""app"">Table S4</xref>). The missing values were compensated using a width of 0.3 and a downshift of 2.8. Welch’s <italic toggle=""yes"">t</italic>-test was applied to the proteins of these two groups with Benjamini–Hochberg FDR correction (q = 0.05). The 33 upregulated proteins (red square) and 17 downregulated proteins (blue square) were defined as proteins with fold changes of 2 or more and less than 0.5, respectively (<xref rid=""biomedicines-12-02172-f002"" ref-type=""fig"">Figure 2</xref> and <xref rid=""app1-biomedicines-12-02172"" ref-type=""app"">Table S5</xref>). The proteins that differed significantly between the two groups are shown in a heat map and dendrogram in <xref rid=""biomedicines-12-02172-f003"" ref-type=""fig"">Figure 3</xref>. <xref rid=""app1-biomedicines-12-02172"" ref-type=""app"">Tables S6 and S7</xref> provide details on the <italic toggle=""yes"">p</italic>-values, Cohen’s D, molecular functions, and biological processes for each protein. The molecular function and biological process were cited from “Inter Pro Classification of protein families”, “<uri http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink href=""https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/"">https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/</uri> (accessed on 19 June 2024)” [<xref rid=""B45-biomedicines-12-02172"" ref-type=""bibr"">45</xref>]. The upregulated proteins were analyzed using Shiny GO 0.80 “<uri http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink href=""http://bioinformatics.sdstate.edu/go/"">http://bioinformatics.sdstate.edu/go/</uri> (accessed on 8 May 2024)” as follows: a false discovery rate (FDR) cutoff of q = 0.05, a pathway size of 2–5000, and the options “remove redundancy” and “abbreviate pathways” enabled. The enrichment analysis of the GO Biological Process is presented in <xref rid=""biomedicines-12-02172-f004"" ref-type=""fig"">Figure 4</xref> and <xref rid=""app1-biomedicines-12-02172"" ref-type=""app"">Table S8</xref>. The highest fold enrichment was observed for the negative regulation of the amyloid precursor protein biosynthetic process. The proteins responsible for this are ITM2A and ITM2C. ITM2A was detected in the RTT group, except in RTT-5, whereas it was not detected in the NC group except in NC-4. ITM2C was detected in the RTT group, except in RTT-3, whereas it was not detected in the NC group except in NC-4. The enrichment analysis of the KEGG pathway is shown in <xref rid=""biomedicines-12-02172-f005"" ref-type=""fig"">Figure 5</xref> and <xref rid=""app1-biomedicines-12-02172"" ref-type=""app"">Table S9</xref>. Among the proteins involved in the PI3K-Akt signaling pathway, four were upregulated in the RTT group: COL4A2, ANGPT1, LAMB1, and LAMC1. Among these proteins, COL4A2 was detected in all patients in the RTT group, and only NC-2 and NC-4 were detected in the NC group. In addition, ANGPT1, LAMB1, and LAMC1 were detected in all patients. We focus on the 33 up- and 17 downregulated proteins identified through a comparison between the RTT group and the NC group, and the correlation between the log2-transformed mass of the extracted proteins and the CSS in the RTT group was examined. A correlation coefficient (R) > 0.7 was defined as being indicative of a highly correlated relationship [<xref rid=""B46-biomedicines-12-02172"" ref-type=""bibr"">46</xref>,<xref rid=""B47-biomedicines-12-02172"" ref-type=""bibr"">47</xref>]. Twelve proteins, including nine from the upregulated group and three from the downregulated group, exhibited a strong correlation with the CSS (<xref rid=""biomedicines-12-02172-f006"" ref-type=""fig"">Figure 6</xref> and <xref rid=""app1-biomedicines-12-02172"" ref-type=""app"">Figure S2</xref>). Two of these proteins, UBE3B and CHL1, were expressed only in patients with RTT (<xref rid=""app1-biomedicines-12-02172"" ref-type=""app"">Table S2</xref>). Through a DIA proteomic analysis of plasma-isolated EVs-cp, we identified 33 upregulated and 17 downregulated proteins in participants with RTT compared to the NCs. Instead of a decrease in structural proteins, there was an increase in inflammation-associated pathways, such as ECM–receptor interaction and focal adhesion, including the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway. Among the 50 proteins analyzed, UBE3B, a ubiquitin ligase, exhibited the highest correlation coefficient with CSS in the RTT group. This finding suggests that UBE3B might serve as a novel biomarker for assessing the development or severity of RTT. A number of studies have employed a proteomic analysis in the context of patients diagnosed with Rett syndrome [<xref rid=""B37-biomedicines-12-02172"" ref-type=""bibr"">37</xref>,<xref rid=""B48-biomedicines-12-02172"" ref-type=""bibr"">48</xref>,<xref rid=""B49-biomedicines-12-02172"" ref-type=""bibr"">49</xref>]. To date, only two proteomic analyses using human serum have been reported. One of these compared two pairs of patients with Rett syndrome with the same mutation in sisters with healthy controls [<xref rid=""B48-biomedicines-12-02172"" ref-type=""bibr"">48</xref>], while the other compared 25 patients with typical Rett syndrome with <italic toggle=""yes"">MECP2</italic> mutations with healthy controls [<xref rid=""B49-biomedicines-12-02172"" ref-type=""bibr"">49</xref>]. In these studies, 6 and 17 significantly different proteins were identified, respectively. In the present study, 50 proteins were identified, representing a greater number than that reported in previous studies. Furthermore, while the majority of the previously reported proteins were elevated in inflammation-related proteins, several non-inflammatory proteins were identified in the present study. It is postulated that this discrepancy is attributable to the fact that the present study targets extracellular vesicles. In current study, the PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway was upregulated in the RTT group. However, among the four related proteins, LAMB2, LAMC2, and COL4A2 were upregulated in the other five pathways. The PI3K/AKT pathway, a downstream signaling pathway of BDNF, is downregulated in patients with RTT [<xref rid=""B50-biomedicines-12-02172"" ref-type=""bibr"">50</xref>]. However, RTT pathogenesis is thought to be associated with inflammation, and elevated levels of oxidative stress- and inflammation-related proteins have been reported [<xref rid=""B49-biomedicines-12-02172"" ref-type=""bibr"">49</xref>,<xref rid=""B51-biomedicines-12-02172"" ref-type=""bibr"">51</xref>,<xref rid=""B52-biomedicines-12-02172"" ref-type=""bibr"">52</xref>]. It is possible that feedback at the expense of the decreased activity of the BDNF pathway may have resulted in a predominant increase in the proteins associated with these pathways. In this study, we detected more than 2-fold significant differences in protein levels compared to the previously reported proteomic results. While previous reports have mainly highlighted inflammation-related proteins, our study identified DHX9, VNN1, and TBK1 as upregulated inflammation-related proteins and MMP25 as a downregulated one. DExH-box helicase 9 (DHX9), a member of the DExD/H-box RNA helicase superfamily II, is an autoantigen that induces serum inflammation in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus [<xref rid=""B53-biomedicines-12-02172"" ref-type=""bibr"">53</xref>]. It also promotes macrophage-mediated inflammation [<xref rid=""B54-biomedicines-12-02172"" ref-type=""bibr"">54</xref>] and interacts with the MECP2 protein [<xref rid=""B55-biomedicines-12-02172"" ref-type=""bibr"">55</xref>]. VNN1 is a protein associated with oxidative stress, and it is overexpressed when oxidative stress is elevated [<xref rid=""B56-biomedicines-12-02172"" ref-type=""bibr"">56</xref>]. We believe that oxidative stress is enhanced in RTT [<xref rid=""B57-biomedicines-12-02172"" ref-type=""bibr"">57</xref>]. TBK1, which is rapidly activated in response to mitochondrial damage and is involved in autophagizing damaged mitochondria [<xref rid=""B58-biomedicines-12-02172"" ref-type=""bibr"">58</xref>], is upregulated in Rett syndrome, suggesting abnormalities in mitochondrial function [<xref rid=""B59-biomedicines-12-02172"" ref-type=""bibr"">59</xref>]. MMP25 is upregulated and downregulated when the PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway is activated and suppressed, respectively [<xref rid=""B60-biomedicines-12-02172"" ref-type=""bibr"">60</xref>], although the underlying mechanism is unknown. There have been no reports of increased or decreased protein levels in patients with RTT. While previous reports focused on the elevation of inflammation-related proteins, this study detected several other significantly different proteins, including inflammation-related proteins, which may be due to extracellular vesicle extraction. In the present study, increased levels of plasma UBE3B were identified as a potential biomarker of RTT. On the other hand, some investigators reported that the level of BDNF—a neurotrophic factor—is decreased in patients with RTT [<xref rid=""B61-biomedicines-12-02172"" ref-type=""bibr"">61</xref>,<xref rid=""B62-biomedicines-12-02172"" ref-type=""bibr"">62</xref>]. The BDNF/TrkB pathway is involved in many brain functions, including neuronal survival, neurite outgrowth, and synapse formation [<xref rid=""B63-biomedicines-12-02172"" ref-type=""bibr"">63</xref>]. BDNF cannot cross the BBB; therefore, the direct administration of BDNF has not shown therapeutic efficacy. However, trophinetide, an IGF-1 analog and a neurotrophic factor, can cross the BBB and mimic the effects of BDNF, resulting in symptomatic improvement [<xref rid=""B31-biomedicines-12-02172"" ref-type=""bibr"">31</xref>]. Tyrosine phosphorylation residues outside the TrkB kinase activation domain Phospho-Tyr785 recruits and activates PLCγ, hydrolyzing phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate to produce diacylglycerol (DAG) and inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3) [<xref rid=""B53-biomedicines-12-02172"" ref-type=""bibr"">53</xref>,<xref rid=""B64-biomedicines-12-02172"" ref-type=""bibr"">64</xref>]. Reduced BDNF levels lead to decreased IP3 levels, which are inversely correlated with the level of the calcineurin catalytic subunit, PPP3CC [<xref rid=""B65-biomedicines-12-02172"" ref-type=""bibr"">65</xref>]. In mouse studies, Ppp3cc is ubiquitinated by Ube3b, the mouse ortholog of UBE3B, in a manner that regulates correct spine density [<xref rid=""B66-biomedicines-12-02172"" ref-type=""bibr"">66</xref>]. In conclusion, mutations in MECP2 reduce BDNF and IP3 levels, increase PPP3CC levels, and increase UBE3B levels. These proteins are involved in neuronal plasticity, suggesting that the severity of symptoms may correlate with their levels. If this hypothesis is correct, the symptoms of patients with RTT are likely due to the decreased expression of the neurotrophic factor BDNF. However, since BDNF cannot pass through the BBB, RTT cannot be treated directly with BDNF. The creation of a therapeutic drug that targets the downstream signaling protein may prove to be an effective means of improving symptoms. Furthermore, the assessment of treatments for Rett syndrome is primarily based on clinical observations. Given that the symptoms of Rett syndrome are associated with neurological degeneration caused by <italic toggle=""yes"">MECP2</italic> mutations, a long-term observational approach is necessary to monitor the healing process. Demonstrating a decline in UBE3B, a potential target protein, at the commencement of treatment could serve as a sensitive indicator for the evaluation of therapeutic efficacy. Another protein, CHL1, which is exclusively found in patients with RTT, may be elevated based on the following hypothesis. The amyloid precursor protein (APP)—a protein produced by neurons and released from presynaptic terminals for use at dendritic synapses—is important for neurite outgrowth and synapse formation [<xref rid=""B67-biomedicines-12-02172"" ref-type=""bibr"">67</xref>,<xref rid=""B68-biomedicines-12-02172"" ref-type=""bibr"">68</xref>,<xref rid=""B69-biomedicines-12-02172"" ref-type=""bibr"">69</xref>,<xref rid=""B70-biomedicines-12-02172"" ref-type=""bibr"">70</xref>]. APP releases secreted metabolites upon cleavage. Degradation by the β-site APP cleavage enzyme (BACE1) via the amyloidogenic pathway results in the secretion of AICD and amyloid beta (Aβ), which is potentially associated with psychiatric symptoms and microcephaly in AD and ASD. In the non-amyloidogenic pathway, sAPPα is produced by α-secretase ADAM10 and cleaved by γ-secretase into AICD and P3 peptides. sAPPα and P3 are both neurotrophic and neuroprotective. MECP2 regulates ADAM10 via miRNA-197 [<xref rid=""B71-biomedicines-12-02172"" ref-type=""bibr"">71</xref>], and <italic toggle=""yes"">MECP2</italic> expression and phosphorylation levels increase in the CA1 hippocampus of rats injected with Aβ [<xref rid=""B72-biomedicines-12-02172"" ref-type=""bibr"">72</xref>]. The GO Biological Process with the greatest fold change in the enrichment analysis in this study was the Negative Regulation of Amyloid Precursor Protein Biosynthesis. This pathway is possibly enhanced by negative feedback owing to increased APP metabolites in patients with RTT (<xref rid=""biomedicines-12-02172-f005"" ref-type=""fig"">Figure 5</xref>). The related proteins, such as ITM2C (also known as BRI3) and BACE1, interact with each other, suggesting that the balance between ADAM10 and BACE1 is altered in patients with RTT [<xref rid=""B73-biomedicines-12-02172"" ref-type=""bibr"">73</xref>,<xref rid=""B74-biomedicines-12-02172"" ref-type=""bibr"">74</xref>]. ADAM10 and BACE1 activity regulate CHL1 levels in neurons and in vivo [<xref rid=""B75-biomedicines-12-02172"" ref-type=""bibr"">75</xref>], with ADAM10 also promoting BACE1-mediated CHL1 proteolysis [<xref rid=""B76-biomedicines-12-02172"" ref-type=""bibr"">76</xref>]. These findings suggest that CHL1 was expected to be detected in the RTT group. However, ADAM10 was found in plasma EVs-cp from both groups and did not show a significant difference between them. Similarly, L1CAM and CNTN2, whose intracellular concentrations were altered by ADAM10, BACE1, and CHL1, were either detected in only one patient with RTT or were not detected in any patient (<xref rid=""biomedicines-12-02172-t001"" ref-type=""table"">Table 1</xref>). Whether these results reflect limitations in test sensitivity or underlying pathophysiological variations requires further investigation. It should be noted that the present study is subject to a number of limitations. Firstly, the number of patient specimens collected in this study was relatively limited, with only six specimens being available for analysis. Our findings indicate that the protein UBE3B was predominantly expressed in the patient group. However, a further investigation is required to confirm whether similar results can be obtained in a large cohort of patients and whether the same test can be reproduced in a larger cohort of patients. Secondly, we did not perform a nanoparticle analysis and transmission electron microscopy on our prepared samples in the present study; therefore, the samples are of unknown particle size and are likely to contain non-vesicular entities. Meanwhile, in our samples, the EV markers such as CD9 and CD82 [<xref rid=""B77-biomedicines-12-02172"" ref-type=""bibr"">77</xref>] showed high levels within the top 300 ranks of the identified proteins in all samples; these markers are generally found in low levels at under 1000 ranks in the plasma proteome analysis [<xref rid=""B78-biomedicines-12-02172"" ref-type=""bibr"">78</xref>]. From these findings, we considered that EVs were collected in our samples and used the term “EVs-containing preparations” for our samples that may contain both EVs and non-vesicular entities according to the MISEV2023 recommendations [<xref rid=""B77-biomedicines-12-02172"" ref-type=""bibr"">77</xref>]. Thirdly, 50 significantly differentially expressed proteins were identified (33 upregulated and 17 downregulated), representing more than double the number of proteins detected in the previous proteomics report. However, the function of these proteins could not be analyzed, so it will be necessary to verify whether these proteins are actually associated with MECP2 mutations. It is believed that only when UBE3B is found to be associated with MECP2 can it be expressed as a target protein for use as a biomarker. Through DIA proteomics of EVs-cp samples extracted from the plasma of patients with RTT, we identified the upregulation of the PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway and the upregulation of UBE3B as potential biomarkers.",N/A,24 9 2024
Rett Syndrome: The Emerging Landscape of Treatment Strategies,"Rett syndrome (RTT) has enjoyed remarkable progress in achieving specific therapies. RTT, a unique neurodevelopmental disorder first described in 1966, progressed slowly until the landmark paper of Hagberg and colleagues in 1983. Thereafter, rapid advances were achieved including the development of specific diagnostic criteria and the active search for a genetic etiology, resulting 16 years later in identification of variants in the methyl-CpG-binding protein (<italic toggle=""yes"">MECP2</italic>) gene located at Xq28. Shortly thereafter, the NIH Office of Rare Diseases funded the RTT Natural History Study (NHS) in 2003, initiating the acquisition of natural history data on clinical features from a large population of individuals with RTT. This information was essential for advancement of clinical trials to provide specific therapies for this disorder. In the process, the International Rett Syndrome Association (IRSA) was formed (now the International Rett Syndrome Foundation—IRSF), which participated directly in encouraging and expanding enrollment in the NHS and, subsequently, in developing the SCOUT program to facilitate testing of potential therapeutic agents in a mouse model of RTT. The overall objective was to review clinical characteristics developed from the NHS and to discuss the status of specific therapies for this progressive neurodevelopmental disorder. The NHS study provided critical information on RTT: growth, anthropometrics, longevity, key comorbidities including epilepsy, breath abnormalities, gastroesophageal dysfunction, scoliosis and other orthopedic issues, puberty, behavior and anxiety, and progressive motor deterioration including the appearance of parkinsonian features. Phenotype–genotype correlations were noted including the role of X chromosome inactivation. Development of clinical severity and quality of life measures also proved critical for subsequent clinical trials. Further, development of biochemical and neurophysiologic biomarkers offered further endpoints for clinical trials. Initial clinical trials prior to the NHS were ineffective, but advances resulting from the NHS and other studies worldwide promoted significant interest from pharmaceutical firms resulting in several clinical trials. While some of these have been unrewarding such as sarizotan, others have been quite promising including the approval of trofinetide by the FDA in 2023 as the first agent available for specific treatment of RTT. Blarcamesine has been trialed in phase 3 trials, 14 agents have been studied in phase 2 trials, and 7 agents are being evaluated in preclinical/translational studies. A landmark study in 2007 by Guy et al. demonstrated that activation of a normal <italic toggle=""yes"">MECP2</italic> gene in a null mouse model resulted in significant improvement. Gene replacement therapy has advanced through translational studies to two current phase 1/2 clinical trials (Taysha102 and Neurogene-401). Additional genetic therapies are also under study including gene editing, RNA editing, and X-chromosome reactivation. Taken together, progress in understanding and treating RTT over the past 40 years has been remarkable. This suggests that further advances can be expected.","

Rett syndrome (RTT) may represent an exception. First recognized in the late 1950’s by Andreas Rett, a developmental pediatrician in Vienna, Austria and by Bengt Hagberg, a child neurologist in Uppsala, Sweden, RTT languished in medical literature after the original description by Rett in 1966 [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR1"">1</xref>]. Sufficient differences existed between the individuals described in this report and those seen by Hagberg that further information did not appear until the latter was encouraged by other child neurologists in Europe to describe his experience and that of fellow child neurologists. Following a chance meeting of Hagberg and Rett around 1980, Hagberg decided that this unique neurodevelopmental disorder should be called Rett syndrome. The landmark publication of Hagberg et al. in the Annals of Neurology in 1983 [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR2"">2</xref>] resulted in the worldwide recognition of RTT, and with it, an intensive search for a definitive etiology was launched. As RTT was seen almost exclusively in females, these efforts pointed to a genetic causation and focusing on the X chromosome. In stepwise fashion over the next sixteen years, the search was increasingly restricted to the distal portion of the long arm of the X chromosome at Xq28 [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR3"">3</xref>, <xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR4"">4</xref>]. In 1999, Ruthie Amir et al. [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR5"">5</xref>] presented their findings which linked RTT to variations in the gene, methyl-CpG-binding protein 2 (<italic toggle=""yes"">MECP2</italic>) at Xq28. In the intervening years between 1983 and 1999, much emphasis was placed on identifying individuals with RTT, aided by the first set of clinical criteria generated at a conference organized by Rett in 1984 [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR6"">6</xref>]. Further, recognition of variant presentations became evident differentiating classical (typical) RTT and variant (atypical) RTT. In addition, other presentations emerged including an early-onset seizure variant [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR7"">7</xref>] and a variant with exceptionally early neurodevelopmental delay [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR8"">8</xref>]. These latter two were subsequently associated with their own individual genetic signatures: <italic toggle=""yes"">CDKL5</italic> variants were identified in the early-onset seizure variant [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR9"">9</xref>], now called <italic toggle=""yes"">CDKL5</italic> deficiency disorder and <italic toggle=""yes"">FOXG1</italic> variants [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR10"">10</xref>], were identified in those with early developmental delay, now called <italic toggle=""yes"">FOXG1</italic> disorder. A much smaller number of males was also recognized, expressing a wide variation in features ranging from early onset neonatal encephalopathy [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR11"">11</xref>] to significant developmental delay. Some of these males appeared to have features typical of RTT. This is now known to result from somatic mosaicism or Klinefelter syndrome (47XXY), each expressing two X chromosomes with one having an <italic toggle=""yes"">MECP2</italic> variant [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR12"">12</xref>]. Even before identification of <italic toggle=""yes"">MECP2</italic> variants, treatment trials were developed for RTT syndrome, but with the expansion of clinical diagnoses throughout the world and the identification of a genetic marker by Amir et al. [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR5"">5</xref>], a search for effective therapies rapidly intensified including both pharmaceutical products and specific gene strategies. Increased diagnosis of RTT was aided by progressive revisions of the diagnostic criteria in 2002 [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR13"">13</xref>] and 2010 [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR14"">14</xref>], the first responding to the recent identification of the specific gene, and the second representing a simplification and stratification of the prior criteria based on the rapid expansion in clinical diagnoses over the intervening eight years and advocated by the need to be certain that the terminology used was clearly understood across the world. Simultaneously with the Hagberg report in 1983, diagnoses were made for the first time in the US: in Washington DC, Seattle, and Houston. The diagnosis of RTT in three girls in Washington led their mothers to form the International Rett Syndrome Association [IRSA, now the International Rett Syndrome Foundation (IRSF)]. IRSA rapidly mobilized parent engagement and patient recruitment, which created a national presence in the US and greatly facilitated, through the support of travel clinics across the US, the subsequent US Natural History Study (USNHS), which was founded in 2003 and began enrollment in 2006. IRSF also developed a drug-testing feasibility program called the Steve Kaminsky Scout program, which facilitated the testing of potential therapeutic agents in an animal (mouse) model of RTT (Rettsyndrome.org foundation Scout Program and performed by PsychoGenics, Inc.). This program, which was begun in 2013, has been utilized as an essential forerunner in moving pharmaceutical agents to human trials and has tested more than 33 compounds (see below). The objective of this review was to understand the clinical features of RTT derived from the USNHS, the largest study to date, and to provide an overview on the status of specific pharmacologic and genetic therapies for RTT. This review covers the history of Rett syndrome from its first recognition by Andreas Rett and Bengt Hagberg more than 60 years ago through the initial studies assessing clinical criteria and genetic etiology to the USNHS of RTT. The NIH-sponsored RTT USNHS provided the largest clinical repository of individuals with RTT and RTT-related disorders gathered over 16 years. Individuals were seen semiannually, annually, or biannually depending on their age. More than 1600 individuals with RTT were evaluated, with a mean of 5.4 visits and a range of 1 to 18 visits. Literature derived from the USNHS was surveyed to address the relevant issues related to RTT including clinical trial readiness. With these advances in understanding RTT, specific therapeutic initiatives were also reviewed. These included a search of literature relative to translational studies and clinical trials for specific agents, assessment of ClinicalTrials.gov, the International Rett Syndrome Foundations report on “Companies Investing in Clinical Trials for Rett” (rettsyndrome.org), and the 2023 report from Medgadget, “Rett Syndrome Pipeline Insights” (<ext-link ext-link-type=""uri"" http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink href=""https://www.medgadget.com/2023/rett-syndrome-pipeline-insights-20-key-companies-investigating-their-lead-candidates-to-improve-the-treatment-space-by-DelveInsight"">https://www.medgadget.com/2023/rett-syndrome-pipeline-insights-20-key-companies-investigating-their-lead-candidates-to-improve-the-treatment-space-by-DelveInsight</ext-link>). The RTT USNHS was funded by the Office of Rare Diseases at the NIH in 2003, with data first being acquired in 2006. The resulting data were utilized to underscore the accuracy and suitability of the 2010 diagnostic criteria revision and created a rich reservoir of clinical information essential for developing subsequent clinical trials. The USNHS ended in 2021 with more than 1600 individuals with RTT having been enrolled. The information derived from this study together with a broad increase in publications worldwide greatly expanded the depth and breadth of understanding of RTT and encouraged advances in drug discovery and clinical trials, as described below. Growth failure was recognized as an early feature of RTT. Abnormal deceleration in the rate of head growth was noted as early as the second month of life and overall reduction in height and weight growth rates was remarkable in comparison with those in typically developing females. Data from the USNHS underscored these features and led to the development of specific growth charts (height, weight, body mass index, and head circumference) for RTT [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR15"">15</xref>]. The initial clinical criteria for RTT included microcephaly, which was subsequently removed as a criterion, as up to 20% may have head circumferences in the normal range despite undergoing an abnormal deceleration in head growth after birth. Anthropometric measurements were provided on 1154 females with RTT demonstrating significant reductions compared to typically developing individuals [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR16"">16</xref>]. Of interest, muscle area measurements were significantly greater in those individuals with independent arm and hand use and gait. Longevity was assessed using Kaplan–Meier methodology in the North American database [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR17"">17</xref>] and in the USNHS [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR18"">18</xref>] indicating that 50% survival exceeded 50 years of age. When the original group described by Rett was reassessed in 2010 [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR19"">19</xref>], the median age of survival was less than 14 years and the likelihood of reaching 25 years of age was 21%. These dramatic differences in survival over the last 30 years were related both to earlier diagnosis and to improved healthcare including better dietary management, increasing recognition of the need for improved overall health maintenance, the expansion of the clinical care teams, and the increased emphasis on physical and occupational therapies. The discovery of <italic toggle=""yes"">MECP2</italic> variants as the principal etiology for RTT by Amir et al. [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR5"">5</xref>] was fundamental in the expansion of clinical investigations in RTT. This gene product predominantly activates or inhibits methyl-binding domains in the nuclei of neurons and glia in the CNS [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR20"">20</xref>, <xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR21"">21</xref>]. The complete roster of genes regulated by MECP2 is not completely evident, but this ability to regulate other genes is crucial in producing the neurodevelopmental abnormalities in RTT. The identification of <italic toggle=""yes"">MECP2</italic> variants in > 96% of those meeting the clinical criteria for RTT led to the identification of clear genotype–phenotype correlations with three specific recurrent point variations (R133C, R294X, and R306C) and distal carboxy-terminal truncations having overall milder features than four recurrent point mutations (R106W, R168X, R255X, and R270X), deletions or insertions, or the so-called large deletions involving one or more exons [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR22"">22</xref>–<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR24"">24</xref>]. In most individuals with RTT, the <italic toggle=""yes"">MECP2</italic> variant is de novo, arising as a new mutation in the rapidly dividing germinal cells of the sperm. However, the identification of mothers who shared the same variant with their daughters but were phenotypically normal or had mild-to-moderate developmental delays suggested that variations in X chromosome inactivation (XCI) could be responsible [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR3"">3</xref>, <xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR25"">25</xref>, <xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR26"">26</xref>]. In addition, the occurrence of identical twins with the same variant and differing clinical features could be explained by similar variations. Fang et al. [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR27"">27</xref>] noted significant skewing of XCI in blood in up to 36% of individuals in the NHS. Clearly, these analyses do not necessarily reflect the XCI pattern in the CNS but do suggest a possible explanation for the observed clinical variability. The distribution of the <italic toggle=""yes"">MECP2</italic> variant in the CNS is a random process and could vary from individual to individual, also serving as a basis for clinical variation. Another issue is the potential association between parental age and the increased incidence of RTT. However, detailed analysis of the NHS data failed to identify a relationship between parental age and the diagnosis of RTT [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR28"">28</xref>]. Interestingly, other X-linked disorders (Duchenne muscular dystrophy and hemophilia A and B) also do not show a relationship with parental age [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR29"">29</xref>–<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR31"">31</xref>]. Males with <italic toggle=""yes"">MECP2</italic> variants were also enrolled in the NHS. Thirty males were reported with the broad array of clinical features noted above including the early neonatal encephalopathy. Two males had somatic mosaicism and met clinical criteria for RTT, whereas more than a dozen males had the male RTT encephalopathy [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR12"">12</xref>]. RTT is a complex disorder with multiple touchpoints for intervention. It is likely that a combination of therapies will be necessary to address these issues. The progress noted below underscores this perception in view of the incremental improvements noted with trofinetide. The current treatment options for the common clinical issues related to RTT are summarized in Table <xref rid=""Tab1"" ref-type=""table"">1</xref>. These include specific pharmaceutical agents for epilepsy, gastroesophageal reflux, delayed stomach emptying, constipation, sleep, anxiety, self-abuse, muscle rigidity/hypertonia, drooling, pain, prolonged QTc, bone health, menstrual management, and health maintenance. These products have proved effective overall but may require continued oversight to be certain that they remain effective over the lifetime.<table-wrap id=""Tab1""><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Rett syndrome: current landscape of symptomatic pharmaceuticals</p></caption><table frame=""hsides"" rules=""groups""><thead><tr><th align=""left"">Clinical issue</th><th align=""left"">Pharmaceutical therapies</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align=""left"">Epilepsy</td><td align=""left""><p>Multiple medications including valproic acid/sodium valproate; oxcarbazepine; lamotrigine; ketogenic diet; vagal nerve stimulator</p><p>Rescue medications: rectal and intranasal diazepam; intranasal midazolam</p></td></tr><tr><td align=""left"">GE-reflux</td><td align=""left"">Proton pump inhibitors (preferred); H<sub>2</sub>-blockers</td></tr><tr><td align=""left"">Stomach emptying</td><td align=""left"">Erythromycin; bethanecol</td></tr><tr><td align=""left"">Constipation</td><td align=""left"">Polyethylene glycol; magnesium sulfate, magnesium citrate; senna</td></tr><tr><td align=""left"">Sleep</td><td align=""left"">Melatonin; trazodone (> 6 years); gabapentin (up to 6 years); clonidine; antihistamines (only short-term as lose efficacy)</td></tr><tr><td align=""left"">Anxiety</td><td align=""left"">SSRIs: escitalopram; sertraline</td></tr><tr><td align=""left"">Self-abuse</td><td align=""left"">Risperidone</td></tr><tr><td align=""left"">Muscle rigidity/hypertonia</td><td align=""left"">Baclofen; botulinum toxin</td></tr><tr><td align=""left"">Drooling</td><td align=""left"">Atropine ophthalmic drops (under tongue); glycopyrrolate</td></tr><tr><td align=""left"">Pain</td><td align=""left"">Ibuprofen; acetaminophen</td></tr><tr><td align=""left"">Prolonged QTc</td><td align=""left"">Beta-blockers; mexiletine</td></tr><tr><td align=""left"">Breathing</td><td align=""left"">None universally effective: buspirone; topiramate</td></tr><tr><td align=""left"">Bone health</td><td align=""left"">Vitamin D (800 IU, at least); calcium; denosumab; bisphosphonates</td></tr><tr><td align=""left"">Menstrual management</td><td align=""left"">Oral contraceptives including progestin-only products; recommend avoiding medroxyprogesterone injection due to adverse bone issues and weight gain</td></tr><tr><td align=""left"">Health maintenance</td><td align=""left"">Multivitamins; complete immunizations</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><p><italic toggle=""yes"">QTc</italic> corrected QT interval</p></table-wrap-foot></table-wrap> In terms of specific agents directed at improving overall outcomes in RTT, an increasing number of pharmacologic agents have entered testing at the translational or clinical level over the past twenty years. To some extent, this was aided by the Scout program developed by the IRSF in 2013, initially under the initiative of Dr Steve Kaminsky, IRSF’s chief scientific officer at that time and named for him. The agents are described in three sections. The first deals with early clinical trials with two conducted before the identification of <italic toggle=""yes"">MECP2</italic> variants as the principal etiologic cause of RTT. The second deals with more recent clinical trials and is separated into three sections. The first covers completed trials, the second deals with a number of agents being studied at the preclinical level, and the third involves the current gene therapy trials as well as the preclinical studies of gene editing, X-chromosome reactivation, and RNA editing. The last quarter century has brought a virtual explosion of new therapies being examined in clinical trials for RTT. One product, trofinetide, was approved by the FDA in March 2023. In as much as trofinetide produces incremental improvement rather than completely reversing the adverse effects of RTT completely, it is anticipated that other agents will be necessary to lead to even better treatment outcomes. At the same time, the long-anticipated advent of gene therapy trials has now begun with two separate treatment strategies being explored. It is recognized that these trials may require substantial patience before they can be fully deployed. Further, the study of additional gene replacement strategies is even farther in the future as they attempt to move from preclinical study to active clinical trials. Nevertheless, the relatively rapid advance in therapeutic intervention in RTT is noteworthy. One can only anticipate further advances in the coming years to achieve the goals of parents, caregivers, scientists, and physicians.",N/A,9 9 2024
miR126-mediated impaired vascular integrity in Rett syndrome,"Rett syndrome (RTT) is a neurodevelopmental disorder that is caused by mutations in melty-CpG binding protein 2 (MeCP2). MeCP2 is a non-cell type-specific DNA binding protein, and its mutation influences not only neural cells but also non-neural cells in the brain, including vasculature associated with endothelial cells. Vascular integrity is crucial for maintaining brain homeostasis, and its alteration may be linked to the pathology of neurodegenerative disease, but a non-neurogenic effect, especially the relationship between vascular alternation and Rett syndrome pathogenesis, has not been shown. Here, we recapitulate a microvascular network using Rett syndrome patient-derived induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells that carry MeCP2[R306C] mutation to investigate early developmental vascular impact. To expedite endothelial cell differentiation, doxycycline (DOX)-inducible ETV2 expression vectors were inserted into the AAVS1 locus of Rett syndrome patient-derived iPS cells and its isogenic control by CRISPR/Cas9. With these endothelial cells, we established a disease microvascular network (Rett-dMVNs) and observed higher permeability in the Rett-dMVNs compared to isogenic controls, indicating altered barrier function by MeCP2 mutation. Furthermore, we unveiled that hyperpermeability is involved in the upregulation of miR126–3p in Rett syndrome patient-derived endothelial cells by microRNA profiling and RNAseq, and rescue of miR126–3p level can recover their phenotype. We discover miR126–3p-mediated vascular impairment in Rett syndrome patients and suggest the potential application of these findings for translational medicine.","Rett syndrome (RTT) is a neurodevelopmental disorder that is caused by mutations in the X-linked gene encoding melty-CpG binding protein 2 (MeCP2) <sup><xref rid=""R1"" ref-type=""bibr"">1</xref>,<xref rid=""R2"" ref-type=""bibr"">2</xref></sup>. Patient symptoms typically are recognized in early developmental stage between 6–12 months including the loss of hand skills, speech and social engagement, motor abnormalities, and cognitive impairments <sup><xref rid=""R3"" ref-type=""bibr"">3</xref></sup>. MeCP2 is expressed in various types of cells including neural cells (neurons and astrocytes) and non-neural cells such as endothelial cells and pericytes. Because of pervasiveness of MeCP2 expression and the melty-CpG binding site, its mutation influences not only neuronal health and activity but also non-neural tissue in the brain, including vascular networks associated with endothelial cells <sup><xref rid=""R4"" ref-type=""bibr"">4</xref>,<xref rid=""R5"" ref-type=""bibr"">5</xref></sup>. Indeed, RTT patients frequently present with reduced skeletal growth, hypo-perfusion in the area of the midbrain and upper brainstem, and poor circulation <sup><xref rid=""R6"" ref-type=""bibr"">6</xref>,<xref rid=""R7"" ref-type=""bibr"">7</xref></sup>, implicating a compromised brain microvasculature in RTT. In addition, vasculogenesis and angiogenesis toward the neural tube are some of the primitive events in neudodevelopment and it occurs before neurogenesis and oligodendrocytegenesis as well as astrocytogenesis <sup><xref rid=""R8"" ref-type=""bibr"">8</xref></sup>. Vascular formation and differentiation in the brain begins during the early embryonic period and it becomes functional shortly once it is formed <sup><xref rid=""R9"" ref-type=""bibr"">9</xref>–<xref rid=""R11"" ref-type=""bibr"">11</xref></sup> instead astrocytes and myelinated neurons do not appear until soon after birth<sup><xref rid=""R12"" ref-type=""bibr"">12</xref></sup>. Therefore, primitive vascular alternation accompanied by developmental neurotoxicity at a systems biology level widely impacts following neurodevelopmental events and disease progression<sup><xref rid=""R13"" ref-type=""bibr"">13</xref>–<xref rid=""R15"" ref-type=""bibr"">15</xref></sup>. Vascular permeability is the capability to control the molecule exchange between vessels, tissues, and organs. In the brain, specifically, the blood-brain barrier (BBB) strictly regulates molecule transportation, including nutrients, waste, and toxins in both influx and efflux directions to maintain homeostasis of the brain in health conditions<sup><xref rid=""R16"" ref-type=""bibr"">16</xref></sup> and its alternations are linked to a pathological process in neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer’s disease <sup><xref rid=""R17"" ref-type=""bibr"">17</xref>,<xref rid=""R18"" ref-type=""bibr"">18</xref></sup> and Parkinson’s disease <sup><xref rid=""R19"" ref-type=""bibr"">19</xref>
<xref rid=""R20"" ref-type=""bibr"">20</xref></sup>. Interestingly, it has been reported this BBB breakdown is present prior to Aβ plague accumulation in Alzheimer’s disease patients <sup><xref rid=""R21"" ref-type=""bibr"">21</xref></sup>. Therefore, BBB breakdown may trigger the alternation of neuronal circumstances, resulting in induced neurodegeneration, mitochondrial dysfunction as well as aggregation of Aβ, but no pathological role of vascular alternation in RTT has been shown so far. To date, there has been only limited evidence indicating impaired BBB permeability in both Rett syndrome individuals and MeCP2-null mouse models, but existing evidence is growing and accumulating. Recent studies showed that MeCP2-null mouse (Mecp2-/y, Mecp2<sup>tm1.1Bird</sup>) exhibited alternation of BBB integrity along with the decreased expression of tight junctions such as OCLN and CLDN5 in cortex <sup><xref rid=""R22"" ref-type=""bibr"">22</xref></sup>. It might be impacted by increased matrix metallopeptidase 9 (MMP9) expression by inducing the degradation of basal lamina. Vessels from female MeCP2<sup>+/−</sup> mice show a reduced endothelium-dependent relaxation due to a reduced Nitric Oxide (NO) availability secondary to an increased reactive oxygen species generation <sup><xref rid=""R23"" ref-type=""bibr"">23</xref></sup>. Additionally, RNA sequencing and proteomics approaches reveal morphology alteration of the blood vessel in Mecp2<sup>tm1.1Jae/+</sup> mice and increase the protein level related to the blood-brain barrier <sup><xref rid=""R24"" ref-type=""bibr"">24</xref></sup>. Therefore, altered brain vascular homeostasis and subsequent BBB breakdown may be induced in MeCP2 deficient mice (MeCP2 null mice). However, the specific role of MeCP2 mutation in human development with respect to vascular permeability and association with neurodevelopmental alternation accompanying neurovascular interaction remains unknown due to the lack of a disease model recapitulating this complicated pathological process. Here, we engineer a 3D microvascular network (MVN) model in microfluidic devices using Rett syndrome patient-derived induced pluripotent stem (iPS), which carries MeCP2[R306C] mutation and investigate endothelial specific molecular pathway by MeCP2 mutation undelaying alternation of vascular permeability associated with vascular-specific microRNA (miR-126). MeCP2[R306C] mutation on the transcription repression domain (TRD) is one of the common SNP mutations (9–10%) that does not influence affinity to the methyl CpG binding domain, but it disrupts the interaction with the NCoR corepressor complex <sup><xref rid=""R25"" ref-type=""bibr"">25</xref></sup>. We first modified the iPS cell from the Rett syndrome patient by knocking in doxycycline (DOX)-inducible ETV2 gene cassette by CRISPR/ Cas9, which is now one of the promised ways to directly differentiate endothelial cells rapidly <sup><xref rid=""R26"" ref-type=""bibr"">26</xref>,<xref rid=""R27"" ref-type=""bibr"">27</xref></sup>. iEC were then embedded in a fibrin gel in a microfluidic device to form 3D vascular networks, which were subsequently used for permeability tests. Impaired vascular permeability was observed in patient-derived vasculature with Rett syndrome. Subsequent transcriptomic analysis elucidated that these impartments are associated with the signaling pathway of miR-126, along with the decreasing tight junction expression mediated by these impairments. Moreover, downregulating miRNA-126–3p by expressing antisense miRNA-126–3p partially restored endothelial barrier function and upregulated tight junctions, inhibiting the Ang2/Tie2 signaling pathway. These results provide clear evidence that miR-126–3p is a direct target of MeCP2 and a mediator of vascular impairment caused by MeCP2[R306C] mutations. It also identifies miR-126–3p as a promising therapeutic target for restoring vascular impairment. This study holds promise for potential translational applications aimed at rescuing vascular alterations in the early developmental stages of Rett syndrome, as well as in other neurodegenerative and developmental disorders.  This paper first describes the miRNA-126 mediated vascular alternation in Rett syndrome microvascular networks. We established ETV2-expressing iPS cells that express MeCP2[R306C] mutations and native MeCP2 by CRISPR/Cas9, which allowed us to obtain endothelial cells rapidly (<xref rid=""F1"" ref-type=""fig"">Fig. 1</xref>), then engineered microvascular networks in a microfluidic device (<xref rid=""F3"" ref-type=""fig"">Fig. 3</xref>). Location controlled knocking in gene cassette which has Tet-ETV2 into AAVS1 locus realize stable and reproducible endothelial differentiation over lentivirus based ETV2 overexpression<sup><xref rid=""R37"" ref-type=""bibr"">37</xref></sup> and transfection with mRNA <sup><xref rid=""R38"" ref-type=""bibr"">38</xref></sup>, allowing them to minimize line-dependent (donor-dependant) variations. Although the procedure of fabricating an MVN has been shown earlier by our group <sup><xref rid=""R39"" ref-type=""bibr"">39</xref>–<xref rid=""R42"" ref-type=""bibr"">42</xref></sup> and promised way, this is the first <italic toggle=""yes"">in vitro</italic> model that recapitulates early developmental vascular alternation in Rett syndrome, specifically focusing on endothelial barrier function regulating the permeability of molecules by using patient-derived iPS cells. In both 2D and 3D characterization of iEC, tight junction gene expression (ZO-1) was downregulated in endothelial cells and vasculature from Rett syndrome patients (<xref rid=""F2"" ref-type=""fig"">Fig. 2</xref>, <xref rid=""F3"" ref-type=""fig"">3</xref>, and <xref rid=""F4"" ref-type=""fig"">4</xref>). One of the most important highlights of this study is that we confirmed RTT-iVascular, which is fabricated from Rett syndrome patient-derived iPS cells, displayed higher permeability, indicating altered endothelial barrier functions (<xref rid=""F4"" ref-type=""fig"">Fig. 4e</xref>). This discovery is consistent with previous literature shown using MeCP2-null mouse (Mecp2-/y, Mecp2tm1.1Bird)<sup><xref rid=""R22"" ref-type=""bibr"">22</xref>
<xref rid=""R23"" ref-type=""bibr"">23</xref></sup>. Although the MeCP2-null mouse model causes the increase of matrix metallopeptidase 9 (MMP9), and this should be involved in BBB disruption, we did not observe MMP1 and MMP9 dysregulation (<xref rid=""F4"" ref-type=""fig"">Fig. 4h</xref>), which are critical proteases for vascular turnover with collagen. This might be explained by the structural difference of the non-catalyst domain of MMP2 and MMP9, which is important for substrate binding and interactions between humans and mice <sup><xref rid=""R43"" ref-type=""bibr"">43</xref>–<xref rid=""R45"" ref-type=""bibr"">45</xref></sup>, and this suggested the advantage of the human <italic toggle=""yes"">in vitro</italic> model compared to the mouse model. Transcriptome analysis revealed that MeCP2[R306C] mutation in endothelial cells itself downregulated as “Regulation of vascular development” and “Protein localization to cell-cell junction” in RTT-iEC (<xref rid=""F2"" ref-type=""fig"">Fig. 2f</xref>, <xref rid=""F2"" ref-type=""fig"">h</xref>). This result advocated that MeCP2 plays an important role in vascular development and homeostasis of vascular integrity, and MeCP2[R306C] mutations negatively impact it. To clarify how MeCP2[R306C] mutations influenced endothelial barrier function along with losing tight junction potential, we focused on endothelial-specific miRNA-126–3p. This miRNA is critical for endothelial differentiation and development <sup><xref rid=""R46"" ref-type=""bibr"">46</xref>,<xref rid=""R47"" ref-type=""bibr"">47</xref></sup> and is also involved in vascular disease <sup><xref rid=""R48"" ref-type=""bibr"">48</xref></sup>. We discovered miRNA-126–3p is highly expressed in RTT-iEC compared to WT-iEC and target gene expressions of miRNA-126–3p were downregulated in contrast, which contains <italic toggle=""yes"">EGFL7</italic>, <italic toggle=""yes"">IGFBP2, BEGFA, ADAM9, SPRED1</italic>, and <italic toggle=""yes"">PIK3R2</italic> (<xref rid=""F5"" ref-type=""fig"">Fig. 5f</xref>). Integrated analysis of miRNA profiling and RNAseq enforced the evidence showing miRNA-126–3p mediated dysregulation of vascular integrity in RTT-iEC (<xref rid=""F5"" ref-type=""fig"">Fig. 5f</xref>, <xref rid=""F5"" ref-type=""fig"">g</xref>) along with down-regulation of TEK and EDN-1, which are important genes for junction stabilization and cell survival, and regulation of vasoconstriction (<xref rid=""F5"" ref-type=""fig"">Fig. 5h</xref>, <xref rid=""F5"" ref-type=""fig"">i</xref>, <xref rid=""F5"" ref-type=""fig"">j</xref> and <xref rid=""F6"" ref-type=""fig"">Fig. 6f</xref>, <xref rid=""F6"" ref-type=""fig"">g</xref>). Downregulation of TEK further caused the upregulation of FOXO1 and PI3K signaling pathways to activate the Ang2/Tie2 positive feedback loop, leading to vascular instability and decreased vascular integrity (<xref rid=""F6"" ref-type=""fig"">Fig. 6e</xref>). EDN-1, producing endothelin, is an important driver of vasoconstriction and regulating the blood pressure. Downregulation of EDN-1 in RTT-iEC can explain the poor circulation of blood in RTT patients, which has been shown in previous literature <sup><xref rid=""R6"" ref-type=""bibr"">6</xref>,<xref rid=""R7"" ref-type=""bibr"">7</xref></sup>, along with eNOS downregulation<sup><xref rid=""R23"" ref-type=""bibr"">23</xref></sup>. Moreover, the knockdown of miR-126–3p in RTT-iEC could rescue the phenotype of MVNs along with the restoration of TEK and EDN-1 gene expression (<xref rid=""F6"" ref-type=""fig"">Fig. 6e</xref>). Taken together, these results show clear evidence that miR-126–3p is one of the direct targets of MeCP2 and mediator of vascular impairment by MeCP2[R306C] mutations and one of the good therapeutic target to restore vascular function. In the transcription process of microRNA, MeCP2 directly interacts with RNA polymerase II to modulate their transcription, and the mutation of MeCP2 disturbs downstream processing <sup><xref rid=""R49"" ref-type=""bibr"">49</xref>,<xref rid=""R50"" ref-type=""bibr"">50</xref></sup>. In addition, it has been reported that the interaction between Drosha and DGCR8 along with MeCP2 plays an important role in the processing of miR-199a during the process precursor miRNA (pri-miRNA), and a lack of MeCP2 leads to negatively regulate miR-199 level in neurons, resulting in altered axon development and synapse formation <sup><xref rid=""R32"" ref-type=""bibr"">32</xref>,<xref rid=""R51"" ref-type=""bibr"">51</xref></sup> and neural stem cell fate specification <sup><xref rid=""R52"" ref-type=""bibr"">52</xref></sup>. Unlike neurons, the role of microRNA in endothelial cells is not known in the context of vascular development. We first observed the microRNA-mediated role of MeCP2 in their vascular development, which might lead to an impairment of neuronal activity as a consequence since it is known that BBB breakdown is one of the fundamental biological events in Alzheimer’s disease<sup><xref rid=""R39"" ref-type=""bibr"">39</xref></sup> and Huntington’s disease<sup><xref rid=""R53"" ref-type=""bibr"">53</xref></sup> and other neurodegenerative and neurodevelopmental disorders<sup><xref rid=""R54"" ref-type=""bibr"">54</xref>,<xref rid=""R55"" ref-type=""bibr"">55</xref></sup>. Therefore, altered vascular impairment by MeCP2 mutation, which we showed in this paper, may presumably influence neurogenesis and brain microenvironment. Another literature showed neuronal activity also regulates blood-brain barrier efflux transport and cross-talk with each other <sup><xref rid=""R56"" ref-type=""bibr"">56</xref></sup>. So far, there is little clear evidence to express the link between vascular impairment and regression of neurons in human Rett syndrome patients, although it was shown in mice model <sup><xref rid=""R22"" ref-type=""bibr"">22</xref></sup>. This <italic toggle=""yes"">in vitro</italic> microvascular model from patient-derived cells and the capability of co-culture with neurons <sup><xref rid=""R40"" ref-type=""bibr"">40</xref></sup> could provide new tools to investigate the neurovascular interaction in the context of early developmental change in Rett syndrome for translational medicine. In conclusion, we discovered miR-126–3p-mediated vascular alternation by MeCP2[R306C] mutation in Rett syndrome, along with downregulation of TEK and EDN1. The combination of our directed differentiation method into endothelial cells from patient-derived iPS cells with CRISPR/Cas knock in dox-inducible ETV2 and the microfluidic device facilitates to obtain robust 3D microvascular networks and allow us to measure permeability, which can recaptulate vasculogenesis process in Rett syndrome. Restoration of miR-126–3p level effectly rescure the endotehlail barrier function in RTT-iVascular along with modulating Ang/Tie2 signaling pathway and tight junction stabilization. This promised platform using patient-derived iPS cells and CRISPR/Cas9-based ETV2 knock-in system with the microfluidic device could apply to any other neurodevelopmental and neurodevelopmental disorder such as Alzheimer’s disease and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.

RettDb: the Rett syndrome omics database to navigate the Rett syndrome genomic landscape,"Rett syndrome (RTT) is a neurodevelopmental disorder occurring almost exclusively in females and leading to a variety of impairments and disabilities from mild to severe. In >95% cases, RTT is due to mutations in the X-linked gene <italic toggle=""yes"">MECP2</italic>, but the molecular mechanisms determining RTT are unknown at present, and the complexity of the system is challenging. To facilitate and provide guidance to the unraveling of those mechanisms, we developed a database resource for the visualization and analysis of the genomic landscape in the context of wild-type or mutated <italic toggle=""yes"">Mecp2</italic> gene in the mouse model. Our resource allows for the exploration of differential dynamics of gene expression and the prediction of new potential MECP2 target genes to decipher the RTT disorder molecular mechanisms. 
<bold>Database URL</bold>: <ext-link http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink href=""https://biomedinfo.di.unipi.it/rett-database/"" ext-link-type=""uri"">https://biomedinfo.di.unipi.it/rett-database/</ext-link>","Rett syndrome (RTT) (Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man, OMIM: 312750; Orphanet rare disease code, ORPHA: 778) is a rare neurodevelopmental disorder occurring almost exclusively in females with a frequency of 1 in 10 000 live female births [<xref rid=""R1"" ref-type=""bibr"">1</xref>]. It is the second cause of severe intellectual disability in females after the Down syndrome [<xref rid=""R2"" ref-type=""bibr"">2</xref>]. More than 95% of typical RTT cases show mutations in <italic toggle=""yes"">MECP2</italic> (methyl-CpG binding protein 2) gene [<xref rid=""R3"" ref-type=""bibr"">3</xref>, <xref rid=""R4"" ref-type=""bibr"">4</xref>]. A similar disorder with clinical features of classic RTT but with earlier onset is the congenital variant of this syndrome (OMIM: 613454, ORPHA: 778), caused by mutation in the FOXG1 gene [<xref rid=""R5"" ref-type=""bibr"">5</xref>]. This pathology and that caused by CDKL5 mutations nowadays are no longer considered atypical RTT cases; they are called, in fact, FOXG1 syndrome or CDKL5 deficiency disorder, respectively. 
<italic toggle=""yes"">MECP2</italic> is an X-linked gene (Xq28) coding for a methyl-CpG binding protein (ENTREZID: 4204), which is a chromatin binding protein [<xref rid=""R6"" ref-type=""bibr"">6</xref>] expressed ubiquitously but with higher expression in the central nervous system (CNS) [<xref rid=""R7"" ref-type=""bibr"">7</xref>]. The absence or misfunction of MECP2 results in broad phenotypes including neurological symptoms caused by an incomplete process of neuron maturation and maintenance of fully functional neurons in the CNS [<xref rid=""R8"" ref-type=""bibr"">8–12</xref>]. While females carrying <italic toggle=""yes"">MECP2</italic> mutations show a wide spectrum of symptom severities, males generally present severe neonatal encephalopathy with rapid progression (OMIM: 300673) and reduced life expectancy in childhood without an aggressive medical support [<xref rid=""R13"" ref-type=""bibr"">13</xref>]. However, there have been reports describing boys with nonspecific mental retardation or with less severe neurological and psychiatric manifestations [<xref rid=""R14"" ref-type=""bibr"">14–18</xref>]; in those cases, the pathological alteration in <italic toggle=""yes"">MECP2</italic> was associated with X-chromosome aneuploidy or detectable levels of somatic mosaicism [<xref rid=""R19"" ref-type=""bibr"">19</xref>, <xref rid=""R20"" ref-type=""bibr"">20</xref>]. Murine <italic toggle=""yes"">Mecp2</italic> gene was cloned in 1992, and it was shown to code for a 486-amino-acid-long protein with binding affinity for methylated CpG dinucleotides <italic toggle=""yes"">in vitro</italic> [<xref rid=""R6"" ref-type=""bibr"">6</xref>, <xref rid=""R21"" ref-type=""bibr"">21</xref>] and characterized as a transcriptional repressor [<xref rid=""R22"" ref-type=""bibr"">22</xref>]. However, due to the lack of direct experimental evidences, MECP2 has been proposed to repress, activate, or anyway modulate gene transcription [<xref rid=""R23"" ref-type=""bibr"">23</xref>]. The main function of MECP2 is reading DNA methylation [<xref rid=""R21"" ref-type=""bibr"">21</xref>, <xref rid=""R24"" ref-type=""bibr"">24</xref>, <xref rid=""R25"" ref-type=""bibr"">25</xref>]. It has been proposed that MECP2 plays a role in chromatin structure and architecture [<xref rid=""R26"" ref-type=""bibr"">26–30</xref>], modulating genomic dynamics and formation of nuclear compartments in normal and pathological conditions [<xref rid=""R31"" ref-type=""bibr"">31–33</xref>]. In addition, MECP2 has been implicated in mRNA splicing [<xref rid=""R34"" ref-type=""bibr"">34</xref>, <xref rid=""R35"" ref-type=""bibr"">35</xref>], miRNA biogenesis [<xref rid=""R36"" ref-type=""bibr"">36–39</xref>], and long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) activity [<xref rid=""R40"" ref-type=""bibr"">40</xref>, <xref rid=""R41"" ref-type=""bibr"">41</xref>]. Although MECP2 is considered an intrinsically disordered protein [<xref rid=""R42"" ref-type=""bibr"">42–44</xref>], several distinct structural and functional domains can be recognized at the secondary and the tertiary structure levels: the N-terminal domain (NTD), the methyl-CpG binding domain (MBD), the intervening domain (ID), the transcription repression domain with the nuclear localization signal, the NCoR interaction domain mediating the interaction with the NCoR1/2 corepressor complex, and the C-terminal domain (CTD) [<xref rid=""R45"" ref-type=""bibr"">45</xref>, <xref rid=""R46"" ref-type=""bibr"">46</xref>]. RTT can arise from a series of different <italic toggle=""yes"">MECP2</italic> mutations causing a range of phenotypes with different degrees of severity [<xref rid=""R4"" ref-type=""bibr"">4</xref>]. The majority of <italic toggle=""yes"">MECP2</italic> mutations are localized in the MBD domain, while others affect the NTD or the rest of the protein. Because the MBD domain is the only structured region of the protein and the DNA-binding domain [<xref rid=""R47"" ref-type=""bibr"">47</xref>], mutations localized here likely change the tertiary structure of the protein and therefore MECP2 binding to DNA and hence the relevance of the MBD mutations. Human <italic toggle=""yes"">MECP2</italic> mutations have been reproduced in mouse lines to model the human pathology and to confirm MECP2 involvement in RTT etiology [<xref rid=""R48"" ref-type=""bibr"">48</xref>]. These mouse models offer the opportunity to study the progression of the pathology from the early stages of brain development to adulthood. These models show a correlation between MECP2 chromatin binding affinity and severity of the phenotype produced by missense mutations. Indeed, mutation R106W (arginine 106 to tryptophan) highly reduces the affinity for the protein to methylated DNA and causes a severe phenotype in humans [<xref rid=""R49"" ref-type=""bibr"">49</xref>], while mutation T158M (threonine 158 to methionine), which reduces the binding affinity by a much lesser amount than the R106W mutation, determines a less severe phenotype [<xref rid=""R49"" ref-type=""bibr"">49</xref>, <xref rid=""R50"" ref-type=""bibr"">50</xref>]. Confirming this trend, the mildest phenotype is associated with R133C mutation (arginine 133 to cysteine) of MECP2 which binds DNA with similar affinity as the wild-type (WT) protein [<xref rid=""R51"" ref-type=""bibr"">51</xref>]. Even though mutations in <italic toggle=""yes"">MECP2</italic> are the major determinants of RTT, the molecular mechanisms linking MECP2 misfunction to the RTT phenotype are still unknown. This is primarily related to the different roles of MECP2 in genome regulation, as discussed earlier. Therefore, at present, it is not possible to design a therapeutic strategy aiming at treating the molecular causes of RTT syndrome via restoration of MECP2 functions. Different clinical trials have been conducted to intervene on specific systems altered in this pathology, but their outcomes are limited to beneficial treatments as supportive care interventions [<xref rid=""R52"" ref-type=""bibr"">52</xref>]. At present, this pathology is without a cure. To make sense of the MECP2 regulatory network, integrative analysis of genome-wide data obtained in different models at different levels of gene regulation (i.e. RNA, protein, etc.) is a potent strategy to define specific regulatory or signaling modules [<xref rid=""R53"" ref-type=""bibr"">53</xref>, <xref rid=""R54"" ref-type=""bibr"">54</xref>]. Indeed, given the availability of different types of open access high-throughput expression profiling data, integrative analysis of omics data brings a novel opportunity to model the molecular etiology of neurodevelopmental genetic syndromes like RTT [<xref rid=""R55"" ref-type=""bibr"">55</xref>]. As detailed later, this powerful integrative approach has been used in modeling the MECP2-regulated gene network, mainly at the level of transcripts and/or proteins, in nonpathological and RTT conditions to identify the molecular pathways dysregulated in the RTT CNS neurons. Most analyses were conducted at the level of the transcriptome using different microarray data of RTT and control samples of human and mouse brain tissues as well as neuronal cells. Those analyses aimed at identifying the common elements dysregulated in RTT by a pathway and gene network analysis [<xref rid=""R56"" ref-type=""bibr"">56–60</xref>]. A similar analysis was performed by Haase <italic toggle=""yes"">et al</italic>. comparing microarrays with RNA-Seq data of human and mouse RTT models [<xref rid=""R61"" ref-type=""bibr"">61</xref>]. RTT mouse model cortex has been also the focus of integrative genome-wide analysis of transcriptomic and proteomic datasets with the goal of performing pathway analysis [<xref rid=""R62"" ref-type=""bibr"">62</xref>, <xref rid=""R63"" ref-type=""bibr"">63</xref>]. In addition, Yu <italic toggle=""yes"">et al</italic>. identified key RTT factors involved in the process of RNA splicing, comparing the RNA-Seq dataset of a mouse RTT model with a comprehensive and curated signature database of RNA-Seq generated after perturbing many splicing factors [<xref rid=""R64"" ref-type=""bibr"">64</xref>]. In the framework of those analyses, our work offers a different perspective on <italic toggle=""yes"">Mecp2</italic> gene regulation activity by combining the transcriptome data of a mouse model of <italic toggle=""yes"">Mecp2</italic> Knock-Out (KO) [<xref rid=""R65"" ref-type=""bibr"">65</xref>] with the genome-wide MECP2 binding activity and chromatin status profile in WT animals to analyze and visualize MECP2 function as a chromatin-dependent transcriptional regulator. With the goal of comparing homogeneous data, we analyzed datasets almost exclusively derived from cerebral cortex at 6/8 weeks after birth of a single RTT mouse model [<xref rid=""R65"" ref-type=""bibr"">65</xref>]. To grant the best accessibility of our integrative analysis, we embedded our results in a Genome Browser easily and freely available to the scientific community. Our resource provides a powerful tool to unravel RTT molecular mechanisms, allowing for the visualization of transcriptomic changes in the context of the chromatin landscape. Moreover, because RTT is a monogenic syndrome with a range of typical symptoms of the autism spectrum disorder [<xref rid=""R16"" ref-type=""bibr"">16</xref>, <xref rid=""R66"" ref-type=""bibr"">66</xref>, <xref rid=""R67"" ref-type=""bibr"">67</xref>], RettDb also offers a simplified context for studying the molecular mechanisms underlying the etiology of autism.   We present here a new web resource for the visualization and analysis of <italic toggle=""yes"">Mecp2</italic> genome-wide gene expression regulation. MECP2 is a reader of the chromatin methylation marks and a regulator of chromatin architecture and gene expression [<xref rid=""R21"" ref-type=""bibr"">21</xref>, <xref rid=""R24"" ref-type=""bibr"">24–26</xref>, <xref rid=""R28"" ref-type=""bibr"">28</xref>, <xref rid=""R29"" ref-type=""bibr"">29</xref>]. Mutations in <italic toggle=""yes"">MECP2</italic> are found in patients affected by RTT [<xref rid=""R3"" ref-type=""bibr"">3</xref>, <xref rid=""R4"" ref-type=""bibr"">4</xref>], the second cause of severe intellectual disability in females after the Down syndrome [<xref rid=""R2"" ref-type=""bibr"">2</xref>]. The aim of this work is to provide the scientific community with a freely available repository of omics datasets related to the RTT syndrome and to MECP2 function in the brain. Previous integrative studies of omics data analyzed and compared transcriptomic and proteomic datasets in order to identify the specific pathways and processes altered when <italic toggle=""yes"">Mecp2</italic> is mutated [<xref rid=""R53"" ref-type=""bibr"">53–60</xref>]. However, MECP2 seems to regulate gene expression by reading and binding to specific chromatin regions [<xref rid=""R21"" ref-type=""bibr"">21</xref>, <xref rid=""R24"" ref-type=""bibr"">24</xref>, <xref rid=""R25"" ref-type=""bibr"">25</xref>]. Therefore, we reasoned that a different approach integrating gene expression with epigenomic datasets would be key to fully understand MECP2 functions and RTT molecular mechanisms. In fact, our web resource enables the analysis of changes in gene expression induced by mutated <italic toggle=""yes"">Mecp2</italic> together with the MECP2 genome-wide binding profile in the context of the WT epigenetic landscape. This perspective provides new insights into MECP2 function as a chromatin-dependent transcriptional regulator and allows for the identification of MECP2 direct and indirect target genes. We focused here on MECP2 function as a chromatin state reader and, therefore, we show histone marker ChIP-Seq datasets from WT samples only. Moreover, to correlate putative enhancers with specific gene expression activities, we visualized loops of functional chromatin using HI-C data. In this case, given the MECP2 role in regulating chromatin architecture [<xref rid=""R26"" ref-type=""bibr"">26–30</xref>], we used both WT and KO <italic toggle=""yes"">Mecp2</italic> HI-C datasets. To show the functionality of our tool, we presented here a case study built searching for novel putative MECP2 targets. <italic toggle=""yes"">Pak3</italic> is a well-known downstream effector of the Rho family of GTPases and a p21-activated serine/threonine kinase involved in cytoskeletal remodeling and spine morphogenesis [<xref rid=""R88"" ref-type=""bibr"">88</xref>], processes dysregulated in the RTT neurons [<xref rid=""R8"" ref-type=""bibr"">8–10</xref>]. We, therefore, tested if <italic toggle=""yes"">Pak3</italic> is a MECP2 direct target. When we analyzed the expression of <italic toggle=""yes"">Pak3</italic>, the RNA-Seq track showed that this gene is downregulated in <italic toggle=""yes"">Mecp2</italic> KO mice. Moreover, on the <italic toggle=""yes"">Pak3</italic> genomic locus, we identified one regulatory region that could mediate MECP2 direct transcriptional regulation of <italic toggle=""yes"">Pak3</italic> expression. This region contains a MECP2 binding peak together with peaks of the epigenetic markers of active chromatin within a CRM (CRM1), suggesting that MECP2 may bind a <italic toggle=""yes"">Pak3</italic> enhancer. This observation is further supported by the HI-C data, showing an arc of functional chromatin containing this putative enhancer together with <italic toggle=""yes"">Pak3</italic> locus. In addition, we found additional peaks of active chromatin markers located upstream of different <italic toggle=""yes"">Pak3</italic> isoforms within the other two CRMs (CRM2 and 3), putative <italic toggle=""yes"">Pak3</italic> promoters, as suggested by these data. Even though the ChIP-Seq data we analyzed did not show MECP2 binding peaks in the CRM2-3, the presence of putative MECP2 binding sites strongly suggests its involvement in the regulation of <italic toggle=""yes"">Pak3</italic> via those CRMs. Another important information we obtained with our web resource was that most of the TFs binding CRM1, CRM2, and CRM3 showed altered expression in the <italic toggle=""yes"">Mecp2</italic> KO mice, suggesting that they may be MECP2 targets as well as coregulators of the MECP2-mediated gene expression activity. In summary, the combination of transcriptomic and epigenomic data in our web database allowed for the identification of <italic toggle=""yes"">Pak3</italic> as a likely direct target of MECP2 regulation. These observations, together with the published results showing that <italic toggle=""yes"">Pak3</italic> misregulation correlates with neuronal morphology defects observed in RTT [<xref rid=""R8"" ref-type=""bibr"">8–10</xref>, <xref rid=""R88"" ref-type=""bibr"">88</xref>], strongly point at PAK3 as a putative MECP2 effector and a possible determinant of the cytoskeletal defects observed in the neurons in RTT patients’ brains. Our data show the value of our resource to formulate hypothesis, which could be further confirmed experimentally. In the database we presented here, we used data derived from bulk omics datasets limited to male adult cerebral cortex at 6–8 weeks after birth of a single RTT mouse model. The rational of this choice was to provide the best pool of homogeneous data avoiding confounding factors and to offer a solid starting point for integrating new data, in terms of age, sex, tissue, and cellular source. Indeed, new data are now available, which allows us to study MECP2 function in a cell type–specific perspective [<xref rid=""R62"" ref-type=""bibr"">62</xref>]. In this context, highly informative data are the transcriptome and epigenome analyzed at the single-cell level, which allows us to obtain information about the effect of MECP2 mutations at cellular- and allele-specific levels [<xref rid=""R94"" ref-type=""bibr"">94</xref>, <xref rid=""R95"" ref-type=""bibr"">95</xref>]. This is particularly important considering that in females, the expression of MECP2 mutation is a mosaic due to random X-chromosome inactivation [<xref rid=""R96"" ref-type=""bibr"">96</xref>, <xref rid=""R97"" ref-type=""bibr"">97</xref>]. Therefore, in the future, we will include in our resource data generated by single-cell experiments to take into account MECP2 mutations in heterozygous females. In addition, we plan to include in the database epigenomic markers ChIP-Seq data of the <italic toggle=""yes"">Mecp2</italic> KO cortices to visualize MECP2 function not only as a chromatin reader but also as a chromatin modifier. Finally, we aim at expanding this resource with the addition of the human RTT data, providing access to a comprehensive and curated repository of all omic datasets generated in RTT models as well as a list of papers published on the subject. The resource will be provided with a link to bioactive small molecules interacting with key RTT genes and to the published Wiki-Pathway visualization of the genes involved in this pathology [<xref rid=""R58"" ref-type=""bibr"">58</xref>]. In conclusion, our data highlight the potential of RettDb to provide a useful tool to formulate new hypothesis and uncover new mechanisms of gene expression and regulation. The continuous development of this resource, incorporating new datasets derived from emerging and refined omic techniques [<xref rid=""R98"" ref-type=""bibr"">98</xref>], will be of paramount importance to improve the predictability of our database in order to shed light on the molecular mechanisms of RTT and the development of new drugs for clinical and preclinical screenings.

Although miRNAs in extracellular vesicles (EVs) have been suggested to play an essential role in several neurological conditions, no prior study has utilized brain organoids to profile EV-derived miRNAs during normal and RTT-affected neuronal development. Here we report the spatiotemporal expression pattern of EV-derived miRNAs in region-specific forebrain organoids generated from female hiPSCs with a MeCP2:R255X mutation and the corresponding isogenic control. EV miRNA and protein expression profiles were characterized at day 0, day 13, day 40, and day 75. Several members of the hsa-miR-302/367 cluster were identified as having a time-dependent expression profile with RTT-specific alterations at the latest developmental stage. Moreover, the miRNA species of the chromosome 14 miRNA cluster (C14MC) exhibited strong upregulation in RTT forebrain organoids irrespective of their spatiotemporal location. Together, our results suggest essential roles of the C14MC and hsa-miR-302/367 clusters in EVs during normal and RTT-associated neurodevelopment, displaying promising prospects as biomarkers for monitoring RTT progression.","Loss-of-function mutations in the X-linked gene <italic toggle=""yes"">Methyl CpG Binding Protein 2 (MECP2)</italic> are identified as the cause of classical Rett syndrome (RTT) [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR1"">1</xref>]. RTT is a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by the onset of progressive deterioration of cognitive and motor skills after 6–18 months of age. However, the underlying molecular alterations can arise as early as neural maturation during prenatal brain development [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR2"">2</xref>]. Due to the inaccessibility of living human brain tissue, animal models and in vitro studies have been at the forefront of brain-related research. More recently, the introduction of human brain organoids as an emerging model system has considerably advanced the field [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR3"">3</xref>]. Their unique feature in recapitulating the formation of distinct cortical layers with a diverse neural cell population has provided a better understanding of neurological conditions. This is particularly interesting for neurodevelopmental disorders where dysfunctions arise very early during developmental stages [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR4"">4</xref>]. These spheroid models also reflect the epigenome and gene expression profile of the fetal cortex [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR5"">5</xref>]. In the context of RTT, brain organoids have unraveled new dimensions of the disorder. For instance, Yildirim et al. [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR6"">6</xref>] detected a lesser thickness of the ventricular zones (VZ) region in cerebral organoids derived from RTT patients. This was due to alterations in migration speed and distance, as well as impairment in the neuronal migration pattern. Further impact of <italic toggle=""yes"">MECP2</italic> mutations on developing organoids was demonstrated in another study by Xiang et al. [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR7"">7</xref>] where cell-type-specific transcriptome analysis revealed severe impairment of cortical interneurons. To investigate brain region-specific alterations in RTT, Gomes et al. [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR8"">8</xref>] applied region-specific brain organoids and found distinct changes in ventral and dorsal forebrain organoids. Specifically, ventral forebrain organoids in RTT, which predominantly includes GABAergic neurons, were characterized by migration defects. Yet, the dorsal forebrain organoids, which mainly include glutamatergic neurons, suffered from premature differentiation. Brain organoids are also being used to study the role of extracellular vesicles (EVs) in healthy and diseased conditions [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR9"">9</xref>]. These tiny but powerful vesicles enclose heterogeneous contents that efficiently enable them to participate in the regulation of several physiological processes. This includes immune response, cell proliferation and development, tissue repair and regeneration after injury, and cell survival by intracellular transferring of protective factors such as heat shock proteins, which prevent protein aggregation in neurodegenerative disorders [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR10"">10</xref>]. Furthermore, we recently reviewed the physiological role of EVs in the developing brain and indicated their involvement during developmental milestones including neurogenesis, synaptogenesis, synaptic pruning, and myelination [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR10"">10</xref>]. We also highlighted their pathological roles in neurodevelopmental diseases, including RTT [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR11"">11</xref>]. Particularly, considering the mosaicism in females with RTT where not all cells express the mutant allele, non-cell autonomous communication through EVs may allow RTT cells to exert a negative impact on the healthy cells [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR12"">12</xref>, <xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR13"">13</xref>]. Amongst the EV content, microRNAs (miRNA, 19–22 nucleotides) are able to silence genes in recipient cells [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR14"">14</xref>]. Using neural cell cultures and animal models, previous studies have suggested a wide range of functions of EV miRNAs in the central nervous system, such as induction of action potential in dorsal root ganglion and communication of the neurogenesis message from differentiated neural progenitor cells to the undifferentiated cells [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR15"">15</xref>, <xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR16"">16</xref>]. Furthermore, they have also been shown to regulate dendritic outgrowth, control the integrity of the brain vascular endothelial cells, and modulate glutamate transporter 1 (GLT1) protein expression in astrocytes [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR17"">17</xref>–<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR19"">19</xref>]. However, to our knowledge, no prior study has utilized human-derived brain organoids to explore the dynamic miRNA expression profiles in EVs during neuronal development in healthy and diseased conditions. In the present study, we therefore sought to investigate the dynamic role of miRNAs in EVs during normal and RTT-affected neuronal development using <italic toggle=""yes"">MECP2</italic>-mutant (RTT) and isogenic control (IC) forebrain organoids from patient-derived hiPSCs. The iPSC-derived forebrain organoids harbored the MeCP2:R255X mutation, a common nonsense mutation located within the transcription repression domain - nuclear localization signal (TRD-NLS) region in the MeCP2 protein, that is associated with more severe RTT phenotypes.   In the present study, we characterized the time-dependent EV expression profiles in region-specific MeCP2:R255X RTT and IC forebrain organoids generated from patient-derived iPSCs. Hereby, we identified several miRNA species and clusters that potentially play a key role in normal and RTT-affected neuronal development. Below is the link to the electronic supplementary material.

Pharmacological inhibition of the CB1 cannabinoid receptor restores abnormal brain mitochondrial CB1 receptor expression and rescues bioenergetic and cognitive defects in a female mouse model of Rett syndrome,,"The endocannabinoid system (ECS) is a widespread neuromodulatory network that controls neuronal activity, neurotransmission, and synaptic plasticity [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR1"">1</xref>, <xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR2"">2</xref>]. Its broad expression in the central nervous system and its involvement in cell-cell communication make the influence of ECS pivotal in the regulation of cognitive, motor, sensory, and emotional processes both during early time windows of development and in adulthood [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR3"">3</xref>]. The effects of cannabinoid binding in the brain are largely mediated by the CB1 cannabinoid receptor (CB1R), a G protein-coupled receptor densely expressed at pre-synaptic sites, where its influence extends over various neurobiological processes, including synaptic transmission, plasticity, and the regulation of cognitive abilities [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR4"">4</xref>, <xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR5"">5</xref>]. In particular, the critical role of CB1R in learning and memory processes [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR6"">6</xref>] is increasingly highlighted by the emerging relevance of this receptor in the pathophysiology of syndromic intellectual disability disorders, a broad class of pathological conditions that arises early in life and entails defective intellectual functioning and adaptive behavior. Indeed, pharmacological inhibition of CB1R was found to improve synaptic function and cognitive performance in murine models of syndromic intellectual disability disorders, such as fragile X syndrome [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR4"">4</xref>, <xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR7"">7</xref>] and Down syndrome [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR8"">8</xref>] for which a phase 1/2 clinical trial (NCT05748405) is currently underway to assess the safety and tolerability of novel CB1R inhibitors in patients with Down syndrome. Groundbreaking immunogold electron microscopy experiments led to the discovery that a proportion of brain CB1R is present at the mitochondria-associated membrane (mtCB1R) [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR9"">9</xref>]; follow-up studies revealed that these subcellularly localized receptors are key for promoting cannabinoid effects on memory functions. In fact, mitochondria-specific knockout of CB1R prevented the deficits in synaptic and memory functions induced by cannabinoid administration in mice [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR10"">10</xref>, <xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR11"">11</xref>]. Interestingly, the effects of mtCB1R stimulation by cannabinoids are mediated by the inhibition of intra-mitochondrial protein kinase A (mtPKA) activity, which leads to altered phosphorylation of the mitochondrial respiratory chain (MRC) complexes subunits and decreased energy production [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR9"">9</xref>, <xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR12"">12</xref>]. These studies uncover the role of mtCB1R-mtPKA signaling in the control of cellular bioenergetics and confirm that brain mitochondria processes intimately control cognitive functions [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR10"">10</xref>, <xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR13"">13</xref>, <xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR14"">14</xref>]. Interestingly, defective mitochondrial respiratory capacity resulting in reduced ATP synthesis and reactive oxidizing species (ROS) overproduction has been observed in the brain of mouse models and in tissues from patients with different syndromic intellectual disability disorders [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR15"">15</xref>–<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR17"">17</xref>], including Rett syndrome (RTT, OMIM #312750), the primary genetic cause of severe intellectual disability in females (1:10,000 live births) [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR18"">18</xref>, <xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR19"">19</xref>]. Most RTT patients carry <italic toggle=""yes"">de novo</italic> loss-of-function mutations in the X-linked gene methyl-CpG-binding protein 2 (<italic toggle=""yes"">MECP2</italic>) which codes for the homonym transcriptional and epigenetic regulator. A peculiar course characterizes the clinical presentation of RTT, where an apparently typical neurobehavioral development is followed by a growth arrest at around 1 year of age, followed by a progressive deterioration of acquired cognitive and motor skills [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR19"">19</xref>]. At the fully symptomatic stage, patients with RTT display cognitive impairments, abnormal fine and gross motor skills, communicative difficulties, distinctive repetitive hand motions, and a significant decline in overall functioning. Mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative stress have been suggested to play a contributing role in the pathogenic process of RTT [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR20"">20</xref>]. In RTT murine models, changes in brain bioenergetics are noticeable during the neonatal period [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR21"">21</xref>] and worsen concomitantly with symptom progression. At the symptomatic stage, a decline in mitochondrial membrane potential alters the physiological function of the MRC and leads to lower ATP synthesis [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR22"">22</xref>, <xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR23"">23</xref>]. Additionally, the impairments in specific MRC complexes induce ROS overproduction by RTT brain mitochondria [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR24"">24</xref>–<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR26"">26</xref>]. Although accumulating evidence suggests that targeting mitochondrial function may be beneficial to contrast RTT symptomatology [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR27"">27</xref>–<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR29"">29</xref>], the mechanisms underlying mitochondrial impairments are still unclear. In the present study, we asked whether an overactive mtCB1R-mtPKA signaling might underlie the brain mitochondrial alterations in RTT and whether its modulation by a systemic administration of the CB1R inverse agonist rimonabant might improve bioenergetics and cognitive defects in mice modeling RTT. To this aim, rimonabant was administered subchronically to symptomatic female mice carrying a truncating mutation of the <italic toggle=""yes"">Mecp2</italic> gene (Mecp2-308) [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR30"">30</xref>] as previously described [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR31"">31</xref>], and its effects on brain mitochondria functionality, systemic oxidative status, and memory function were assessed. Additional details are described in the supplementary materials and methods.  In the present study, we demonstrate that mtCB1R expression is selectively altered in the brain mitochondria of a mouse model of RTT, considered the leading cause of severe intellectual disability in females. Treatment with the CB1R inverse agonist rimonabant normalized mtCB1R overexpression, boosted mtPKA signaling and concomitantly restored brain mitochondrial bioenergetics, peripheral redox homeostasis, and cognitive abilities in RTT mice. The present data identify the brain mtCB1R overexpression as a novel druggable molecular alteration in RTT. Impaired mitochondrial functionality and quality control have been largely described in RTT patients and mouse models [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR24"">24</xref>, <xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR27"">27</xref>, <xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR46"">46</xref>, <xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR47"">47</xref>]. These alterations lead to decreased brain energy availability and have been suggested to contribute to RTT-related impairments in higher brain functions, such as learning and memory [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR27"">27</xref>, <xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR29"">29</xref>, <xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR48"">48</xref>, <xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR49"">49</xref>]. Yet, in spite of the increasing evidence supporting the relevance of these brain alterations for RTT pathophysiology, the underlying molecular mechanisms have not been uncovered. We here provide innovative evidence that intracellular compartmentalization of CB1R is altered in the RTT mouse brain, with CB1R localized at mitochondrial membranes, the pool of receptors that critically controls mitochondrial respiration and energy production in neurons [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR9"">9</xref>, <xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR50"">50</xref>] being selectively overexpressed. Interestingly a similar profile has been previously reported in models of traumatic brain injury [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR50"">50</xref>], in which trauma-induced mtCB1R overexpression was found to promote metabolic abnormalities coupled with a deficit in ATP production. Collectively, these findings underscore the pathological relevance of this molecular alteration. An upregulation of brain CB1R was previously reported in the more compromised male mice carrying a <italic toggle=""yes"">Mecp2</italic>-null mutation [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR51"">51</xref>], suggesting that Mecp2 might be involved in the regulation of CB1R expression levels. Present results extend these findings by demonstrating that the trafficking of CB1R among intracellular compartments is altered in the RTT mouse brain. Of note, treatment with rimonabant reduced total CB1R levels and normalized mtCB1R overexpression in the brain of RTT mice, confirming that the expression and distribution of CB1R are intimately intertwined with its activity [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR52"">52</xref>]. Taken together, these results provide a complex picture in which CB1R signaling appears severely compromised in the RTT mouse brain, stressing the need to explore the relevance of this molecular signature for the pathogenesis and the treatment of this disorder. Of utmost importance, pharmacological inhibition of CB1R rescued mitochondrial dysfunction in symptomatic RTT mouse brains, restoring normal levels of ATP production. Furthermore, the normalization of brain mitochondrial functionality by rimonabant treatment was accompanied by the restoration of memory impairments. These results are consistent with compelling evidence demonstrating that mtCB1R signaling pathways, by directly controlling brain mitochondria functionality, play a pivotal role in the regulation of synaptic transmission and memory formation and support the role of these receptors as promising therapeutic targets for RTT. Indeed, several studies have already suggested that targeting the ECS may represent a promising strategy to treat RTT [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR53"">53</xref>]. We complement this evidence by suggesting that the beneficial effects exerted by ECS modulation may involve the restoration of mitochondria functionality in the RTT brain. Interestingly, we report negative effects of subchronic treatment with a low dose of rimonabant on Wt animals at 1 year of age. This was unexpected given that multiple studies show beneficial effects of rimonabant in cognitive processes [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR54"">54</xref>, <xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR55"">55</xref>]. However, the function of CB1R in learning and memory seems to be heavily influenced by various factors [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR54"">54</xref>], with variations in drug administration protocols affecting rimonabant effects on cognitive performance [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR56"">56</xref>]. Consistent with our findings, an age-dependent effect was also reported, showing nootropic function in young mice and memory-impairing effects later on [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR57"">57</xref>, <xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR58"">58</xref>]. Notably, mitochondria-related dynamics are suggested to be involved in the age-dependent memory decline sustained by CB1R [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR59"">59</xref>]. Importantly, we found that the rimonabant treatment boosted mtPKA activation in the RTT mouse brain. Since previous studies have demonstrated that stimulation of mtPKA increases mitochondrial respiration and ATP synthesis by targeting subunits of mitochondrial complexes I, IV, and V [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR60"">60</xref>, <xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR61"">61</xref>], it is conceivable that the rimonabant-induced mtPKA activation, observed in the brain of RTT mice, may account for the rescue of mitochondrial dysfunction. In fact, previous studies reported that PKA signaling modulates several mitochondrial processes such as mitochondrial respiratory chain activity and organization [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR62"">62</xref>–<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR64"">64</xref>], and mitochondrial biogenesis [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR65"">65</xref>]. Also, many data point to a role of PKA in the regulation of mitochondrial dynamic and mitophagy [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR66"">66</xref>, <xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR67"">67</xref>], two key mechanisms in the maintenance of mitochondrial homeostasis that have been reported to be altered in RTT [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR47"">47</xref>]. It is however worth noting that while rimonabant treatment rescued Complex V hypofunctionality in the RTT mouse brain mitochondria, it had no effect on the unaltered activity of Complex I, providing support to a selective impact of the pharmacological treatment on specific abnormalities observed in the RTT mouse brain. Of note, in a pioneering study [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR11"">11</xref>], it was also shown that the same cascade of events that involves intra-mitochondrial activation of PKA and controls mitochondrial respiration and ATP production in neurons mediates mtCB1R effects on memory function. Based on this evidence, it can be speculated that the boost in mtPKA activity induced by treatment with rimonabant might have played a role also in the rescue of proper memory functions, possibly by restoring the dendritic spine dysgenesis and impaired synaptic plasticity in RTT mouse brains. In fact, activation of mtPKA signaling was found to promote dendritogenesis and enhance dendrite outgrowth [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR66"">66</xref>, <xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR67"">67</xref>], suggesting that rimonabant may have exerted similar beneficial effects in the RTT mouse model [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR7"">7</xref>, <xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR68"">68</xref>]. However, we cannot exclude that other mechanisms may have contributed to mtCB1R effects on cognitive function since recent evidence has demonstrated that mtCB1R-dependent effects on mitochondrial calcium in neurons can also affect learning and memory in mice [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR69"">69</xref>]. Further studies will have to explore this possibility. Another intriguing explanation for the current findings concerns the possibility that the identified alterations may be at least partly mediated by astrocytic mtCB1R-mtPKA signaling. In fact, astrocytic mtCB1R has been found in the vicinity of hippocampal synapses [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR70"">70</xref>] and has been recognized as a key determinant of synaptic plasticity [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR71"">71</xref>]. Of particular relevance to our study, the activation of the astrocytic mtCB1R has been demonstrated to influence neuronal signaling and redox status through the PKA-mediated downregulation of OXPHOS and lactate production [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR72"">72</xref>]. Although the specific effects of astrocytic mtCB1R on memory function remain unexplored, astrocytic-derived lactate is known to sustain memory consolidation [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR73"">73</xref>]. Based on this evidence, and on the literature pointing to astrocytes playing a non-cell-autonomous role in the neuropathology of RTT [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR74"">74</xref>, <xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR75"">75</xref>] and RTT-related impairment in mitochondrial bioenergetics [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR32"">32</xref>, <xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR76"">76</xref>, <xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR77"">77</xref>], it will be interesting in future studies to clarify the cellular specificity of the abnormal mtCB1R-mtPKA signaling in the RTT mouse brain. Of note, rimonabant rescued the aberrant pro-oxidant status of RTT mice by normalizing systemic ROS production. This is in line with previous studies showing a significant boost of the antioxidant defense mechanisms and reduced ROS accumulation after chronic administration of rimonabant at a low dose in aging rats [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR78"">78</xref>]. Interestingly, PKA was also formerly identified as a regulator of the antioxidant defense, through the modulation of the nuclear factor erythroid 2–related factor 2 (Nrf2) signaling pathway [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR79"">79</xref>], which is known to be impaired in RTT [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR43"">43</xref>], suggesting that the mtPKA boost following rimonabant in RTT mice contributes, at least in part, to the reduction in ROS production. Given the involvement of the neuron-astrocyte crosstalk in oxidative mechanisms in RTT [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR80"">80</xref>], it may be interesting in future studies to address the relative contribution of different cell types to the reported rescue of the aberrant pro-oxidant status of RTT mice. Taken together, the present results identify the overexpression of mtCB1R as a molecular signature to be pharmacologically modulated to improve brain mitochondrial alterations and cognitive deficits in RTT. The translational relevance of this observation is stressed by the fact that CB1R antagonism is under active scrutiny at the clinical level as a promising target to rescue cognitive defects in syndromic intellectual disability disorders (NCT05748405), based on the promising results obtained at the preclinical level [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR7"">7</xref>, <xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR8"">8</xref>]. Our results complement previous knowledge by demonstrating that the mechanism underlying the beneficial effects of these drugs may reside in the specific targeting of CB1R present at mitochondrial membranes. This is fully supported by the increasing evidence demonstrating that mtCB1R is specifically responsible for the control of learning and memory processes [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR11"">11</xref>, <xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR69"">69</xref>]. However, to confirm that mtCB1R may represent a common druggable therapeutic target to counteract cognitive dysfunctions, further studies are needed to verify whether abnormal mtCB1R-mtPKA signaling is present in the brain of other syndromic intellectual disability disorders characterized by brain mitochondrial alterations. This could further raise the interest of pharmaceutical companies, thus speeding up the process towards the development of novel drugs to treat cognitive dysfunction in syndromic intellectual disability disorders. In conclusion, our study identifies mtCB1R overexpression as a novel molecular signature in the brain of RTT mice, which may underlie defective brain mitochondrial bioenergetics and cognitive dysfunction; additional investigation is necessary to validate this subcellular pool of CB1R as novel druggable targets with therapeutic potential for RTT and confirm the generalizability of our findings to other syndromic intellectual disability disorders characterized by mitochondrial dysfunctions [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR16"">16</xref>, <xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR82"">82</xref>]. Even though further studies are needed, these findings put mitochondria in the spotlight as a valuable source of unexplored therapeutic targets for the treatment of RTT and other syndromic intellectual disability disorders with a metabolic component, and open to the implementation of innovative targeted interventions.

"Associations between genotype, phenotype and behaviours measured by the Rett syndrome behaviour questionnaire in Rett syndrome",,"Rett syndrome (RTT) is a severe neurodevelopmental disorder, caused by a pathogenic variant on the X-linked methyl CpG binding protein 2 (<italic toggle=""yes"">MECP2)</italic> gene [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR1"">1</xref>], affecting approximately 1 in 9000 liveborn females [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR2"">2</xref>]. The core symptoms include a history of regression of hand and communication skills accompanied by the development of hand stereotypies and gait abnormality, with ongoing impacts on hand, communication and gross motor functions [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR3"">3</xref>]. The disorder is also associated with multiple comorbidities including scoliosis, autonomic dysfunction, epilepsy, poor growth and sleep difficulties [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR3"">3</xref>, <xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR4"">4</xref>]. There are relationships between genotype and clinical presentation. For example, variants such as Large Deletions, p.Arg555* and p.Arg270* are usually severe whereas C-terminal deletions, p.Arg133Cys, p.Arg306Cys and p.Arg294* are generally milder [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR4"">4</xref>].  Beyond the core diagnostic criteria, there are also abnormal behaviours and emotional features such as fluctuations in mood or screaming at night. The Rett Syndrome Behaviour Questionnaire (RSBQ) was developed more than 20 years ago prior to the discovery of the genetic cause for RTT to differentiate the specific behavioural symptoms of female children with RTT from those of females with other severe intellectual disability [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR5"">5</xref>]. Including data derived from an earlier caregiver survey for 143 females with RTT [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR6"">6</xref>], a principal component analysis of items was conducted yielding a 45-item and 8-domain questionnaire for completion by caregivers [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR5"">5</xref>]. There were moderate to high values for internal consistency and good inter-rater and test-retest reliability [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR5"">5</xref>]. The RSBQ was the first behavioural measure developed specifically for RTT. The use of the RSBQ was subsequently expanded to adults [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR7"">7</xref>, <xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR8"">8</xref>], and in the absence of other measures for RTT, it has been approved as an outcome measures for recent clinical trials [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR9"">9</xref>–<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR12"">12</xref>]. An Australian study of females with RTT aged from 3 to 27 years (<italic toggle=""yes"">n</italic> = 145) found that some variants that were usually associated with milder symptoms had higher RSBQ scores [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR8"">8</xref>]. For example, higher Fear/Anxiety scores were more common in individuals with the p.Arg133Cys and pArg306Cys variants and individuals with the p.Arg294* variant were more likely to have high General Mood and Body Rocking scores although low Hand Behaviours and Face Movements scores [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR8"">8</xref>]. In a UK study of females with RTT aged from 4 to 47 years, it was reported that RSBQ scores did not vary with age and in a subset of 50 individuals they appeared stable after a 16-month interval [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR7"">7</xref>]. In a subsequent study undertaken at Boston Children’s Hospital in 2015 with 74 females aged 2 to 11 years, the RSBQ was one of three tools evaluated to measure anxiety in RTT [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR13"">13</xref>]. The Anxiety, Depression and Mood Scale was found to have the best psychometric properties for RTT, and again higher Fear/Anxiety subscale scores from the RSBQ were observed in individuals with milder clinical severity [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR13"">13</xref>].  In clinical trials, the Fear/Anxiety subscale from the RSBQ was a primary endpoint for the mecasermin (recombinant human insulin-like growth factor 1, rhIGF-1) trial and scores were similar for the treatment and placebo groups [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR10"">10</xref>]. However, in the later LAVENDER clinical trial, a 12-week, multi-center, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, Phase 3 study of trofinetide efficacy in 187 females with RTT, there was a statistical significant between-group difference in favour of trofinetide (mean change − 3.1, 95% confidence interval − 5.7, -0.6; <italic toggle=""yes"">P</italic> = 0.0175; Cohen’s <italic toggle=""yes"">d</italic> effect size = 0.37) for the RSBQ Total score, based on the mixed-effect model for repeated measure analysis [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR14"">14</xref>]. The trofinetide group also saw a notable improvement in the Fear/Anxiety, Body rocking and expressionless face subscale scores compared to the placebo group, although the study was not powered to detect subscale differences [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR14"">14</xref>].  Use of the RSBQ in the mecasermin and trofinetide clinical trials has been the catalyst for new validation studies. In a recent US study, 149 caregivers of 2 to 33-year-old individuals with RTT completed the RSBQ at baseline, after 1–2 weeks and again after 1-2months [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR15"">15</xref>]. Analyses found that more than half of caregivers rated 18 items as 0 (“not a problem”) and 6 items as 2 (often a problem) suggesting potential floor or ceiling effects for those items, item agreement between testing occasions was mostly moderate, and test-retest reliability was poor [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR15"">15</xref>]. A recent factor analysis of the RSBQ using the largest sample size (323 children, 309 adults) to date involved multiple sources in the US, UK, Denmark and Australia [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR16"">16</xref>] The 8-factor structure was generally replicated but, a 6-factor solution and a 7-factor solution were also found for children and adults respectively. A new factor combined the original General Mood and Night-time Behaviours subscales and was called Emotional and Disruptive Behaviours (12 items) [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR16"">16</xref>].  There remains little information on how RSBQ scores are associated with genetic and clinical characteristics and how scores can be interpreted in upcoming surveillance studies and clinical trials. Therefore, the aim of this study was to update and expand previous investigations on relationships between age, genotype, movement abnormalities (hand function/walking ability), sleep and RSBQ Total and subscale scores in RTT.  Data were available for 365 individuals with RTT (2 males) and are presented in Table <xref rid=""Tab1"" ref-type=""table"">1</xref>. The median age (range) was 17.8 (2.9–51.9) years. Each of the common variant groups were represented. Approximately one third could walk independently and 40.3% could pick up small objects. Comorbidities were common including seizures (57.8%), constipation (30.1%), reflux (40.3%), insomnia (28.5%) and excessive daytime sleepiness (23.6%). There was a larger proportion of 2–12 year old children in AussieRett than in the InterRett sample (32.4% vs. 19.8%); a smaller proportion of individuals with the p.Arg255* variant in AussieRett than in the InterRett sample (5.4% vs. 13.8%); a larger proportion in the AussieRett sample had constipation compared with the InterRett sample (54.1% vs. 13.8%), and a smaller proportion in the AussieRett sample had reflux compared with the InterRett sample (20.3% vs. 53.9%).

 RSBQ subscale and total scores are presented in Table <xref rid=""Tab2"" ref-type=""table"">2</xref>. The overall mean (SD) Total score was 35 (14). There was little variation by the descriptive categories, except individuals with intermediate walking and hand function abilities had slightly higher scores and the highest scores (> 40) were observed for individuals with abnormal DIMS (insomnia) and DOES (excessive daytime sleepiness) scores. This pattern was generally replicated for each of the subscales, except individuals with the p.Arg294* variant had higher General Mood and lower Face Movements scores, and individuals with the p.Arg306Cys had higher Fear/Anxiety scores. RSBQ scores for the paediatric and adult subgroups are presented in Supplementary Tables <xref rid=""MOESM1"" ref-type=""media"">1</xref> and <xref rid=""MOESM1"" ref-type=""media"">2</xref> in Additional File <xref rid=""MOESM1"" ref-type=""media"">1</xref> and the Total scores were slightly lower for adults (36.6 vs. 33.4).

 This is the largest study to date to evaluate associations between genotype, phenotype and RSBQ scores in RTT. Generally, scores were higher for children, and for individuals with the p.Arg255* variant, intermediate walking and hand function abilities, and abnormal insomnia and excessive daytime sleepiness. Except for associations with sleep, many associations between age, genotype, functional abilities and RSBQ were inconsistent with literature evaluating clinical severity as an outcome in RTT. Our cross-sectional findings suggest different relationships between clinical severity, functional abilities and behaviours, as reflected by RSBQ scores. We expected to find higher scores in adults than children because greater clinical severity has been observed in other cross-sectional studies [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR23"">23</xref>, <xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR24"">24</xref>]. However, RSBQ Total, Night-time Behaviours and Fear/Anxiety scores were higher for children than adults, in line with the other large international sample study (323 children, 309 adults) [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR16"">16</xref>]. This age-related pattern was not observed in a smaller UK study of children and adults (<italic toggle=""yes"">n</italic> = 91) [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR7"">7</xref>]. Lower scores in adulthood could represent a survival bias or that behaviours such as symptoms associated with anxiety were calmer [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR25"">25</xref>]. Not previously reported, our paediatric data showed higher Total, General Mood and Fear/Anxiety scores for children younger than 12 years compared with children 12 years of older. We know that heightened behavioural symptoms such as irritability occur around the regression period [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR26"">26</xref>] and it could be that the following period of relative stability is characterised by a stronger behavioural phenotype than previously recognised. Longitudinal data in RTT shows that clinical severity is greater [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR27"">27</xref>], gross motor skills are poorer [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR28"">28</xref>] and scoliosis increases [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR29"">29</xref>] with increasing age. In contrast, longitudinal data on sleep shows small improvements with age [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR30"">30</xref>].  Individuals with the p.Arg255* variant had the highest Total and Night-Time Behaviour scores showing greater severity of behaviours that appear to accompany their greater clinical severity [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR4"">4</xref>]. In contrast, other variant groups with high RSBQ Total scores were the p.Arg294* and p.Arg133Cys which are usually associated with milder clinical severity for developmental impairments and comorbidities [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR4"">4</xref>]. The patterns between genotype and behaviours as represented in the RSBQ appear different to relationships with the previously investigated construct of clinical severity that represents developmental impairments and comorbidities [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR31"">31</xref>]. We did observe that individuals with the p.Arg294* variant were vulnerable to high General Mood scores, observed also when the sample was restricted to children. This is consistent with previous analyses suggesting that this variant is associated with poorer mental health [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR8"">8</xref>, <xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR25"">25</xref>].  When previously studying anxiety as an outcome using InterRett data [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR25"">25</xref>], we observed that ADAMS scores were higher, indicating more behavioural difficulties, for individuals with intermediate levels of walking and hand function abilities, consistent with the current study. A similar lack of pattern was observed for relationships between frequency of seizures and RSBQ scores. These findings highlight the conceptual differences between behaviours and clinical severity, as also observed in the relationships between variants and RSBQ scores. Insomnia and excessive daytime sleepiness had the strongest relationships with RSBQ Total scores and the General Mood, Breathing Problems, Night-Time Behaviours and Fear/Anxiety subscales. This is not surprising because of the importance for behaviours and mental health attributable to good quality sleep [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR32"">32</xref>, <xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR33"">33</xref>]. Insomnia and excessive daytime sleepiness have negative impacts on mental health in individuals with RTT [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR25"">25</xref>]. Downstream, poor sleep also has impacts on quality of life in RTT [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR34"">34</xref>]. The Breathing Problems subscale in the RSBQ is unusual because it describes neurological rather that behavioural characteristics [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR14"">14</xref>, <xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR16"">16</xref>], although hyperventilation may also be interpreted as indicating anxiety. In the current study, RSBQ scores for Breathing Problems were similar between variant groups in contrast to our previous report where parents rated greater impact of breathing abnormalities for individuals with the p.Arg294* variant [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR35"">35</xref>]. For the whole sample, scores were similar for seizures and gastrointestinal problems. However, children with constipation had higher RSBQ scores compared to children without constipation. It could be that stepped regimens that families use to manage constipation [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR36"">36</xref>] are explored during early childhood and become established as the child grows older, lessening any impacts on the non-verbal behaviours which are captured in the RSBQ. Our data indicates that the RSBQ is an outcome measure of the behavioural rather than the clinical phenotype in RTT [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR14"">14</xref>], as also acknowledged by Percy and colleagues in their recent publication evaluating the RSBQ as an outcome measure. As might be expected, the behavioural phenotype tends to reflect mental health rather than physical functioning. For example, it does not measure comorbidities of poor growth, gastrointestinal problems, scoliosis or epilepsy. In this dataset mental health symptomatology has tended to occur most in individuals with variants of milder severity such as p.Arg294*, p.Arg133Cys and p.Arg306Cys consistent with the patterns seen previously when assessing anxiety [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR25"">25</xref>]. The phenotype of p.Arg255* is interesting because it is localised in the Nuclear Localising Signal in close proximity to p.Arg270*, a genotype associated with early mortality [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR37"">37</xref>, <xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR38"">38</xref>] and thus more likely to feature less commonly in the adult population. In contrast the p.Arg255*, although associated with greater clinical severity [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR4"">4</xref>], has been shown to provide some protection against mortality [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR39"">39</xref>, <xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR40"">40</xref>].  it is important to recognise that the top concerns identified by caregivers of individuals with classic RTT were effective communication, seizures, walking/balance issues, lack of hand use, and constipation [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR41"">41</xref>]. Of these, the only subscale clearly identified in the RSBQ is hand behaviours and there is no specific question as to whether the individual can walk independently. Communication other than eye gaze, seizures and constipation are not measured in the RSBQ. Nevertheless, the RSBQ measures a range of behaviours such as mood, anxiety and night-time behaviours that can be problematic and of great concern to parents. It is important to understand the strengths and limitations of the RSBQ when designing suites of outcome measures for clinical trials. Although the total sample is not population-based, the ability to combine data from two different sources (total sample size 365) is a major strength of the study. We note however that the total data on independent mobility is consistent with the population data presented on trajectories in a 2016 study describing the natural history of scoliosis [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR29"">29</xref>]. We have previously found that the proportion with a p.Arg255* variant is relatively high in InterRett [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR19"">19</xref>] and hence in the combined sample. We selected covariates and RSBQ subscales for analysis which we felt would be meaningful to caregivers and which are reflected in top caregiver concerns [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR41"">41</xref>], although we did not have granular measure of communication which is an important concern for caregivers [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR41"">41</xref>]. We have previously acknowledged the survival effect associated with our InterRett data [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR39"">39</xref>]. There is always going to be a survival effect associated with the adult phenotype but it is important to understand the applicability of the RSBQ to paediatric and adult populations. Our data contribute further to the evidence that the RSBQ measures the behavioural phenotype rather than the clinical severity in RTT as traditionally conceptualised in terms of developmental regression, functional abilities and comorbidities, although it does measure autonomic/breathing irregularities. Its strength is in the assessment of a complex set of behavioural problems including mood difficulties and anxiety as well as hand stereotypies. When designing clinical trials, the RSBQ needs to be complemented by other metrics [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR42"">42</xref>] which adequately assess core functional difficulties and comorbidities [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR43"">43</xref>] and, for additional perspectives, could also include global ratings of impressions of improvements [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR44"">44</xref>]. Analyses of longitudinal RSBQ trajectories and their relationships with genotype and phenotype will also be an important next step to enrich understanding of the natural history of RTT and inform post-clinical trial surveillance.

"Boosting Serotonin Synthesis Is Not Sufficient to Improve Motor Coordination of <italic toggle=""yes"">Mecp2</italic> Heterozygous Mouse Model of Rett Syndrome","Motor deficit is a core symptom of Rett syndrome, a rare neurological disease caused in most cases by mutations of the <italic toggle=""yes"">methyl-CpG-binding protein2</italic> (<italic toggle=""yes"">MECP2</italic>) gene. Serotonin reuptake inhibitors improve motor coordination in <italic toggle=""yes"">Mecp2</italic> heterozygous (Het) mice and serotonin depletion prevented this effect. Here, we assess alterations in indole levels in various brain regions and whether boosting brain serotonin synthesis with the serotonin precursors tryptophan, 5-hydroxytryptophan and α-lactalbumin rescued motor coordination deficit of <italic toggle=""yes"">Mecp2</italic> Het mice. Motor coordination was assessed in the accelerated rotarod during and after systemic administration of serotonin precursors for 2–3 weeks. Since no data are available, the effect of α-lactalbumin on tryptophan, serotonin and 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid levels was evaluated in various brain regions in order to identify the dose of ALAC to evaluate on motor coordination. As compared to WT, <italic toggle=""yes"">Mecp2</italic> Het mice show reduced levels of serotonin in the whole brain, hippocampus, brainstem and cerebral cortex, but not the striatum. Reduced levels of 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid were observed in the hippocampus and brainstem. Doses of serotonin precursors increasing brain tryptophan and/or serotonin production and metabolism had no effect on motor coordination. The results indicate that boosting serotonin synthesis is not sufficient to improve motor coordination of <italic toggle=""yes"">Mecp2</italic> Het mice.","Motor skill impairment is one of the core symptoms of Rett syndrome (RTT), a rare neurological disease caused in most cases by loss-of-function mutations of the methyl-CpG-binding protein 2 gene (<italic toggle=""yes"">MECP2</italic>; <italic toggle=""yes"">Mecp2</italic> in rodents) [<xref rid=""B1-biomolecules-14-01230"" ref-type=""bibr"">1</xref>]. Motor symptoms observed in patients, including limited motility, ataxic gait, motor incoordination and tremors, are reproduced in most mouse models of the syndrome, with a good degree of face validity [<xref rid=""B2-biomolecules-14-01230"" ref-type=""bibr"">2</xref>]. Low levels of serotonin (5-HT; 5-hydroxytryptamine), tryptophan hydroxylase 2 (<italic toggle=""yes"">tph2</italic>) expression and 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5-HIAA), the main metabolite of 5-HT, are found in brain tissue and/or cerebrospinal fluid of RTT patients carrying <italic toggle=""yes"">MECP2</italic> mutations [<xref rid=""B3-biomolecules-14-01230"" ref-type=""bibr"">3</xref>]. Consistently, alterations of brain levels, synthesis and release of 5-HT, and 5-HT receptor expression and function are observed in <italic toggle=""yes"">Mecp2</italic> null mouse models of RTT [<xref rid=""B4-biomolecules-14-01230"" ref-type=""bibr"">4</xref>,<xref rid=""B5-biomolecules-14-01230"" ref-type=""bibr"">5</xref>,<xref rid=""B6-biomolecules-14-01230"" ref-type=""bibr"">6</xref>,<xref rid=""B7-biomolecules-14-01230"" ref-type=""bibr"">7</xref>,<xref rid=""B8-biomolecules-14-01230"" ref-type=""bibr"">8</xref>]. The limited information available in female <italic toggle=""yes"">Mecp2</italic> Het mice shows reduced tissue levels of 5-HT in the hippocampus but not in the raphe area [<xref rid=""B9-biomolecules-14-01230"" ref-type=""bibr"">9</xref>], while no changes are found in brain 5-HT synthesis and cortical extracellular levels under basal condition or in response to a challenge dose of the selective 5-HT reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) fluoxetine [<xref rid=""B4-biomolecules-14-01230"" ref-type=""bibr"">4</xref>]. Experimental studies in female <italic toggle=""yes"">Mecp2</italic> mutant mice show an improvement of motor, cognitive and respiratory symptoms in response to 5-HT receptor agonists and drugs enhancing the endogenous tone of 5-HT at brain synapses such the SSRIs and the mixed serotonergic and noradrenergic antidepressant mirtazapine [<xref rid=""B10-biomolecules-14-01230"" ref-type=""bibr"">10</xref>,<xref rid=""B11-biomolecules-14-01230"" ref-type=""bibr"">11</xref>,<xref rid=""B12-biomolecules-14-01230"" ref-type=""bibr"">12</xref>]. Case reports support the potential use of serotonergic drugs including fluoxetine, 5-HT<sub>1A</sub> receptor agonists or their combination for the treatment of respiratory deficits and stereotypies in patients with RTT [<xref rid=""B13-biomolecules-14-01230"" ref-type=""bibr"">13</xref>,<xref rid=""B14-biomolecules-14-01230"" ref-type=""bibr"">14</xref>,<xref rid=""B15-biomolecules-14-01230"" ref-type=""bibr"">15</xref>] and SSRIs are considered the most effective drugs for the treatment of psychiatric symptoms of RTT [<xref rid=""B16-biomolecules-14-01230"" ref-type=""bibr"">16</xref>]. We recently showed that repeated but not single administration of fluoxetine abolishes the motor coordination deficit in female <italic toggle=""yes"">Mecp2</italic> Het mice and enhances the expression of the MeCP2 protein in several regions of <italic toggle=""yes"">Mecp2</italic> Het mice [<xref rid=""B4-biomolecules-14-01230"" ref-type=""bibr"">4</xref>,<xref rid=""B17-biomolecules-14-01230"" ref-type=""bibr"">17</xref>]. These effects were no longer present after serotonin depletion with the 5-HT synthesis inhibitor p-chlorophenylalanine [<xref rid=""B4-biomolecules-14-01230"" ref-type=""bibr"">4</xref>,<xref rid=""B17-biomolecules-14-01230"" ref-type=""bibr"">17</xref>] suggesting that 5-HT plays a key role in rescuing motor coordination impairment. However, some of the effects of fluoxetine, such as its action on ionic channels and neurosteroid synthesis, are independent of endogenous 5-HT [<xref rid=""B18-biomolecules-14-01230"" ref-type=""bibr"">18</xref>,<xref rid=""B19-biomolecules-14-01230"" ref-type=""bibr"">19</xref>]. Thus, it is not yet clear whether the enhancement of brain 5-HT transmission is in itself sufficient to rescue motor coordination deficit of <italic toggle=""yes"">Mecp2</italic> Het mice or other factors may contribute. Brain 5-HT synthesis depends, among other factors, on the brain concentration of the amino acid precursor tryptophan (TRP), an essential amino acid and physiological substrate of Tph2, the rate-limiting enzyme in the synthesis of brain 5-HT [<xref rid=""B20-biomolecules-14-01230"" ref-type=""bibr"">20</xref>]. Unfortunately, the efficacy of 5-HT precursors in increasing brain 5-HT is limited by their short half-life in humans and rodents [<xref rid=""B21-biomolecules-14-01230"" ref-type=""bibr"">21</xref>,<xref rid=""B22-biomolecules-14-01230"" ref-type=""bibr"">22</xref>,<xref rid=""B23-biomolecules-14-01230"" ref-type=""bibr"">23</xref>] and gastrointestinal adverse effects may occur when relatively high doses of TRP and 5-hydroxytryptophan (5-HTP) are used to overcome their short-lasting effect [<xref rid=""B24-biomolecules-14-01230"" ref-type=""bibr"">24</xref>]. α-lactalbumin (ALAC), a whey protein rich in tryptophan [<xref rid=""B25-biomolecules-14-01230"" ref-type=""bibr"">25</xref>], is well tolerated and safely used to supports adequate growth in infants [<xref rid=""B26-biomolecules-14-01230"" ref-type=""bibr"">26</xref>,<xref rid=""B27-biomolecules-14-01230"" ref-type=""bibr"">27</xref>]. Prolonged ingestion of ALAC increased the ratio of TRP/large neutral amino acids (LNAAs) in human plasma, which favoured the entry of TRP into the brain. In addition, ALAC increased cortical TRP levels and 5-HT synthesis and release in the rat hypothalamus [<xref rid=""B28-biomolecules-14-01230"" ref-type=""bibr"">28</xref>,<xref rid=""B29-biomolecules-14-01230"" ref-type=""bibr"">29</xref>,<xref rid=""B30-biomolecules-14-01230"" ref-type=""bibr"">30</xref>,<xref rid=""B31-biomolecules-14-01230"" ref-type=""bibr"">31</xref>]. ALAC (250–1000 mg/kg) was effective in several models of epilepsy in rats and mice, and counteracted depressive-like behaviour and intestinal inflammation in mice [<xref rid=""B30-biomolecules-14-01230"" ref-type=""bibr"">30</xref>,<xref rid=""B31-biomolecules-14-01230"" ref-type=""bibr"">31</xref>,<xref rid=""B32-biomolecules-14-01230"" ref-type=""bibr"">32</xref>]. Thus, ALAC may be an alternative to TRP and 5-HTP to increase brain 5-HT synthesis/levels, with a safer profile of side effects. The present study aims to provide further evidence on the alteration of 5-HT levels and metabolism and to evaluate the role of different 5-HT precursors in improving motor coordination in <italic toggle=""yes"">Mecp2</italic> Het mice. Since no data are available in the mouse, we assessed the effect of ALAC on brain indoles in order to establish the dose increasing brain TRP and 5-HT levels and metabolism to be used in a subsequent motor test in <italic toggle=""yes"">Mecp2</italic> Het mice.   This study demonstrates that 5-HT and 5-HIAA levels are reduced in adult <italic toggle=""yes"">Mecp2</italic> Het mice (5–6 months of age) and shows that treatment with 5-HT precursors does not modify the motor coordination deficit of <italic toggle=""yes"">Mecp2</italic> Het mice. Although the reduction in 5-HT and 5-HIAA levels in the hippocampus of <italic toggle=""yes"">Mecp2</italic> Het mice confirm previous findings [<xref rid=""B9-biomolecules-14-01230"" ref-type=""bibr"">9</xref>], to our knowledge no other studies assessed whether alterations of 5-HT homeostasis occur in the brain of female <italic toggle=""yes"">Mecp2</italic> Het mice. As compared to WT, <italic toggle=""yes"">Mecp2</italic> Het mice show lower levels of hippocampal, brainstem and cortical 5-HT. This indicates that 5-HT deficiency, albeit small, is widespread across different brain regions except the striatum where no differences are found between genotypes. The reduction in 5-HT levels and metabolism is small and likely not sufficient to account for the motor coordination deficit. Consistently, genetically and pharmacologically induced depletion of brain 5-HT has no effect on rotarod performance in WT mice and does not affect the motor coordination impairment of <italic toggle=""yes"">Mecp2</italic> Het mice [<xref rid=""B4-biomolecules-14-01230"" ref-type=""bibr"">4</xref>,<xref rid=""B35-biomolecules-14-01230"" ref-type=""bibr"">35</xref>]. As in previous studies in male <italic toggle=""yes"">Mecp2</italic> null mice [<xref rid=""B6-biomolecules-14-01230"" ref-type=""bibr"">6</xref>,<xref rid=""B7-biomolecules-14-01230"" ref-type=""bibr"">7</xref>], we found no changes in 5-HT and 5-HIAA in the striatum of <italic toggle=""yes"">Mecp2</italic> Het mice. Several hypotheses have been advanced on the causes of brain 5-HT deficit observed in RTT patients and mouse models of the disease. These include reduced 5-HT innervation, production, reuptake and metabolism of 5-HT [<xref rid=""B6-biomolecules-14-01230"" ref-type=""bibr"">6</xref>]. Although the role of these factors was not systematically addressed in the present study, data presented here and in other published papers may help clarify the role of some of these factors. We found no changes in TRP levels in any brain region investigated. Therefore, the reduced 5-HT levels are not caused by deficiency of the endogenous precursor. Reduced <italic toggle=""yes"">tph2</italic> gene expression has been found in male mice globally lacking the <italic toggle=""yes"">Mecp2</italic> gene and in mice with selective deletion of the gene in 5-HT neurons [<xref rid=""B3-biomolecules-14-01230"" ref-type=""bibr"">3</xref>]. However, another study found no reduction in <italic toggle=""yes"">tph2</italic> expression in raphe nuclei of <italic toggle=""yes"">Mecp2</italic> null mice [<xref rid=""B6-biomolecules-14-01230"" ref-type=""bibr"">6</xref>] and data on <italic toggle=""yes"">tph2</italic> expression in female heterozygous mice are lacking. We measured the levels of 5-HTP after l-aromatic amino acid decarboxylase inhibition, an indicator of 5-HT synthesis [<xref rid=""B36-biomolecules-14-01230"" ref-type=""bibr"">36</xref>], and found no differences between WT and <italic toggle=""yes"">Mecp2</italic> Het mice in 5-HTP accumulation in the hippocampus, striatum, brainstem, prefrontal cortex and the rest of the cerebral cortex [<xref rid=""B4-biomolecules-14-01230"" ref-type=""bibr"">4</xref>]. Thus, the low levels and metabolism of 5-HT found in most brain regions of adult <italic toggle=""yes"">Mecp2</italic> Het mice unlikely reflects reduced 5-HT synthesis. No differences in cortical 5-HT innervation, synaptic markers and expression of 5-HT-related genes such as the serotonin transporter and monoamine oxidase, which may have marked effects on 5-HT storage and metabolism, have been observed in <italic toggle=""yes"">Mecp2</italic> null mice and no data are available in <italic toggle=""yes"">Mecp2</italic> Het mice [<xref rid=""B6-biomolecules-14-01230"" ref-type=""bibr"">6</xref>,<xref rid=""B8-biomolecules-14-01230"" ref-type=""bibr"">8</xref>]. Thus, the factors contributing to the reduction in indole levels observed in <italic toggle=""yes"">Mecp2</italic> Het mice remain largely unknown. 5-HT plays a key role in fluoxetine’s ability to rescue motor coordination impairment of <italic toggle=""yes"">Mecp2</italic> Het mice [<xref rid=""B4-biomolecules-14-01230"" ref-type=""bibr"">4</xref>]. Based on this finding, we expected that 5-HT precursors may mimic the ability of fluoxetine to rescue motor coordination deficit in <italic toggle=""yes"">Mecp2</italic> Het mice but the data presented here do not support this hypothesis. It is unlikely that the lack of effect of 5-HT precursors is due to underdosing as previous studies clearly showed that doses of TRP and 5-HTP similar to those used in the present study or lower increase the production and release of brain serotonin. In addition, TRP and 5-HTP restored normal 5-HT levels in mice with reduced function or total deletion of the <italic toggle=""yes"">Tph2</italic> gene [<xref rid=""B24-biomolecules-14-01230"" ref-type=""bibr"">24</xref>,<xref rid=""B33-biomolecules-14-01230"" ref-type=""bibr"">33</xref>,<xref rid=""B37-biomolecules-14-01230"" ref-type=""bibr"">37</xref>,<xref rid=""B38-biomolecules-14-01230"" ref-type=""bibr"">38</xref>,<xref rid=""B39-biomolecules-14-01230"" ref-type=""bibr"">39</xref>,<xref rid=""B40-biomolecules-14-01230"" ref-type=""bibr"">40</xref>,<xref rid=""B41-biomolecules-14-01230"" ref-type=""bibr"">41</xref>]. Here, we provide evidence that a single dose of 8000 mg/kg ALAC increased brain levels of TRP in <italic toggle=""yes"">Mecp2</italic> Het mice by more than 3-fold. Brain 5-HT levels are only marginally increased by ALAC, while a larger effect is found on brain 5-HIAA, which indicates that ALAC stimulates the synthesis and metabolism of 5-HT. However, these effects are much lower than those achieved after the administration of 300 mg/kg TRP once daily for 14 days under the same experimental conditions used to assess the effect of TRP on motor coordination. Since repeated dosing of TRP had no effect on motor coordination, it is reasonable to conclude that boosting 5-HT synthesis is not sufficient to counteract the motor coordination deficit of <italic toggle=""yes"">Mecp2</italic> Het mice. Consistently, rats ingesting diets enriched in ALAC (roughly 4–30 g/kg/day) show increased brain TRP and 5-HT levels, synthesis and release of 5-HT [<xref rid=""B29-biomolecules-14-01230"" ref-type=""bibr"">29</xref>,<xref rid=""B42-biomolecules-14-01230"" ref-type=""bibr"">42</xref>]. According to dose translation from animal to human studies using the body surface area normalization method [<xref rid=""B43-biomolecules-14-01230"" ref-type=""bibr"">43</xref>], 8000 mg/kg ALAC as used in this study is comparable to the dose increasing TRP in human plasma both in terms of effectiveness and duration [<xref rid=""B44-biomolecules-14-01230"" ref-type=""bibr"">44</xref>]. To our knowledge, this is the first study providing information on dose- and time-dependent effect of ALAC on mouse brain and plasma TRP and brain 5-HT and 5-HIAA levels. Data clearly show that doses of ALAC lower than 8000 mg/kg do not affect brain and plasma TRP and brain levels and metabolism of 5-HT. This suggests that the effects of lower doses of ALAC as used in previous mouse studies can hardly be attributed to changes in TRP and 5-HT availability in the brain and peripheral organs. 5-HT plays an important role in early neuronal development and function including neuronal proliferation, migration and differentiation as well as motor skills [<xref rid=""B45-biomolecules-14-01230"" ref-type=""bibr"">45</xref>,<xref rid=""B46-biomolecules-14-01230"" ref-type=""bibr"">46</xref>,<xref rid=""B47-biomolecules-14-01230"" ref-type=""bibr"">47</xref>]. Thus, it cannot be excluded that the administration of 5-HT precursors during the neonatal period or early childhood may be more effective in improving motor coordination in <italic toggle=""yes"">Mecp2</italic> Het mice compared to administration in adults. Motor coordination improvement in <italic toggle=""yes"">Mecp2</italic> Het mice takes about a week to develop after fluoxetine or citalopram [<xref rid=""B4-biomolecules-14-01230"" ref-type=""bibr"">4</xref>]. This suggests that adaptive changes developing over time likely underlie the ability of SSRIs to rescue motor coordination deficit. Consistently, changes in neuronal excitability, protein synthesis, plasticity or neurogenesis have been involved in the mechanisms facilitating the effect of 5-HT and SSRIs on motor learning [<xref rid=""B48-biomolecules-14-01230"" ref-type=""bibr"">48</xref>] and are defective in patients with RTT and mouse models of the pathology [<xref rid=""B10-biomolecules-14-01230"" ref-type=""bibr"">10</xref>,<xref rid=""B49-biomolecules-14-01230"" ref-type=""bibr"">49</xref>]. The long half-life of fluoxetine and its active metabolite (6 and 12 h, respectively [<xref rid=""B50-biomolecules-14-01230"" ref-type=""bibr"">50</xref>]) ensures prolonged exposure to the drug during the course of treatment. The half-lives of TRP and 5-HTP are short and their effects in rodents generally last a few hours or less [<xref rid=""B23-biomolecules-14-01230"" ref-type=""bibr"">23</xref>,<xref rid=""B24-biomolecules-14-01230"" ref-type=""bibr"">24</xref>,<xref rid=""B40-biomolecules-14-01230"" ref-type=""bibr"">40</xref>,<xref rid=""B51-biomolecules-14-01230"" ref-type=""bibr"">51</xref>,<xref rid=""B52-biomolecules-14-01230"" ref-type=""bibr"">52</xref>]. Thus, it cannot be excluded that the failure of 5-HT precursors to improve motor coordination reflects their short-lived effect on brain 5-HT. However, the effectiveness of citalopram in improving motor coordination of <italic toggle=""yes"">Mecp2</italic> Het mice despite its short half-life (about 1.5 h [<xref rid=""B53-biomolecules-14-01230"" ref-type=""bibr"">53</xref>]) argues against this interpretation. This suggests that factors other than duration of action could account for the different ability of 5-HT precursors and SSRIs to improve motor coordination in <italic toggle=""yes"">Mecp2</italic> Het mice. Restoration of <italic toggle=""yes"">Mecp2</italic> expression globally or selectively in the striatum is sufficient to rescue rotarod impairment in <italic toggle=""yes"">Mecp2</italic> Het mice [<xref rid=""B54-biomolecules-14-01230"" ref-type=""bibr"">54</xref>]. This suggests that the improvement in motor coordination produced by SSRIs likely reflects their ability to promote MeCP2 expression in several brain areas of the <italic toggle=""yes"">Mecp2</italic> Het mouse, including the striatum [<xref rid=""B4-biomolecules-14-01230"" ref-type=""bibr"">4</xref>,<xref rid=""B17-biomolecules-14-01230"" ref-type=""bibr"">17</xref>]. If this effect is not shared by 5-HT precursors, it could explain their ineffectiveness on motor coordination. Further studies are needed to confirm this hypothesis. In summary, current data show that 5-HT precursors alone are not effective in improving motor coordination of <italic toggle=""yes"">Mecp2</italic> Het mice. TRP has no effect alone, but potentiates the antidepressant-like effect of SSRIs [<xref rid=""B33-biomolecules-14-01230"" ref-type=""bibr"">33</xref>,<xref rid=""B55-biomolecules-14-01230"" ref-type=""bibr"">55</xref>,<xref rid=""B56-biomolecules-14-01230"" ref-type=""bibr"">56</xref>]. Therefore, it would be important to explore the possibility that, although ineffective alone, 5-HT precursors may improve the effect of SSRIs on motor coordination in RTT mice.",N/A,29 9 2024
Sex-specific single cell-level transcriptomic signatures of Rett syndrome disease progression,"Dominant X-linked diseases are uncommon due to female X chromosome inactivation (XCI). While random XCI usually protects females against X-linked mutations, Rett syndrome (RTT) is a female neurodevelopmental disorder caused by heterozygous <italic toggle=""yes"">MECP2</italic> mutation. After 6-18 months of typical neurodevelopment, RTT girls undergo a poorly understood regression. We performed longitudinal snRNA-seq on cerebral cortex in a construct-relevant <italic toggle=""yes"">Mecp2e1</italic> mutant mouse model of RTT, revealing transcriptional effects of cell type, mosaicism, and sex on progressive disease phenotypes. Across cell types, we observed sex differences in the number of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) with 6x more DEGs in mutant females than males. Unlike males, female DEGs emerged prior to symptoms, were enriched for homeostatic gene pathways in distinct cell types over time and correlated with disease phenotypes and human RTT cortical cell transcriptomes. Non-cell-autonomous effects were prominent and dynamic across disease progression of <italic toggle=""yes"">Mecp2e1</italic> mutant females, indicating that wild-type-expressing cells normalize transcriptional homeostasis. These results advance our understanding of RTT progression and treatment. Longitudinal snRNA-seq 5’ in a Mecp2e1 mutant mouse model reveals sex-specific gene expression differences in specific cell types, with mutant females showing early and dynamic transcriptional changes linked to disease progression, enhancing our understanding of RTT.","Rett syndrome is a neurodevelopmental disorder primarily affecting females and is characterized by a range of symptoms such as loss of speech, motor abnormalities, and developmental regression at about 6–18 months of age<sup><xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR1"">1</xref></sup>. Rett syndrome most often occurs through spontaneous missense or truncation mutations, thereby predominantly affecting XX females<sup><xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR2"">2</xref></sup>. Males with <italic toggle=""yes"">MECP2</italic> mutations that survive infancy are rare but can be observed in clinical phenotypes ranging from severe neonatal encephalopathy to cognitive impairment<sup><xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR3"">3</xref></sup>. <italic toggle=""yes"">MECP2</italic> encodes the DNA binding protein, methyl CpG binding protein 2 (MeCP2), which is a critical regulator of neuronal gene expression in the brain. Among the two alternatively spliced <italic toggle=""yes"">MECP2</italic> transcripts, only the MeCP2e1 isoform contributes to RTT disease phenotypes<sup><xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR4"">4</xref></sup>. However, most mouse studies of RTT utilize the exon 3-4 knockout model in <italic toggle=""yes"">Mecp2</italic><sup><italic toggle=""yes"">-/</italic>y</sup> males, which is a null model effective for studying MeCP2 function, but not a construct- or sex-relevant model for human RTT<sup><xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR5"">5</xref></sup>. RTT females are heterozygous for <italic toggle=""yes"">MECP2</italic> (<italic toggle=""yes"">MECP2</italic><sup><italic toggle=""yes"">-/+</italic></sup>) mutations and are therefore mosaic for both <italic toggle=""yes"">MECP2</italic> wild-type and mutant cells in the brain. Prior studies in Rett syndrome suggest potential non-cell-autonomous effects of MeCP2 deficiency on wild-type expressing cells in the brain, but these effects have been poorly characterized at a cellular and molecular level<sup><xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR6"">6</xref>–<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR8"">8</xref></sup>. RTT is characterized by a seemingly typical development in infancy, followed by progressive stages of regression in developmental milestones beginning around 6–18 months of age and lasting through early adulthood<sup><xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR1"">1</xref></sup>. We have previously demonstrated that the <italic toggle=""yes"">Mecp2e1</italic> deficient mouse model of RTT, modeled after a human mutation, recapitulates the RTT-relevant extended period of disease symptom progression<sup><xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR4"">4</xref>,<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR9"">9</xref>,<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR10"">10</xref></sup>. However, it is not known when and in which cell types the molecular changes responsible for disease progression occur in <italic toggle=""yes"">MECP2</italic> mutant females versus males. To explore the effects of cellular mosaicism, sex, and cell type on the progression of disease in Rett syndrome, we employed single nuclei RNA-seq (snRNA-seq 5’) analysis in the cerebral cortex of the <italic toggle=""yes"">Mecp2e1</italic> mutant mouse model. We examined the influence of sex, cell type, cellular mosaicism, and disease stage, correlated with progressive disease phenotypes using a systems-level perspective. These results demonstrate that MeCP2 deficiency in females results shows an inherently different disease progression at the cellular and molecular level compared to males, involving stage-specific, non-cell-autonomous transcriptional changes to homeostatic gene pathways that correlate with disease phenotypes and stages.  This study advances our understanding of RTT, offering insights into sex-specific, cell type-dependent, and disease stage-associated transcriptional dysregulation resulting from the cellular complexities related to the X-linked dominant inheritance of <italic toggle=""yes"">MECP2/Mecp2</italic> mutation. This longitudinal analysis of single cortical cell transcriptomes during the gradual progression of disease symptoms in the <italic toggle=""yes"">Mecp2e1</italic><sup><italic toggle=""yes"">-/+</italic></sup> mouse model of RTT provided several new findings critical to the understanding and treatment of human RTT. First, we demonstrated that the female <italic toggle=""yes"">Mecp2e1</italic><sup><italic toggle=""yes"">-/+</italic></sup> mice are inherently different, not simply less severe, in their transcriptional dysregulation compared to mutant <italic toggle=""yes"">Mecp2</italic><sup><italic toggle=""yes"">-/y</italic></sup> males that completely lack <italic toggle=""yes"">Mecp2e1</italic>. Second, we identified transcriptionally dysregulated gene pathways across cell types in female <italic toggle=""yes"">Mecp2e1</italic><sup><italic toggle=""yes"">-/+</italic></sup> cortices that were significantly associated with the progression of multiple disease phenotypes over time. Third, we showed that non-cell-autonomous effects in mosaic female <italic toggle=""yes"">Mecp2e1</italic><sup><italic toggle=""yes"">-/+</italic></sup> mice are responsible for the homeostatic gene pathway dysregulations observed dynamically over time. Lastly, and most important for translational relevance, we showed that female mosaic <italic toggle=""yes"">Mecp2e1</italic> mutant mice better recapitulate the transcriptional dysregulation observed in human RTT cortical cells than <italic toggle=""yes"">Mecp2</italic> null males and may help explain the complexities of progressive and regressive stages of disease in RTT girls. The earliest studies examining the effect of MeCP2 levels on transcription in the brain relied on bulk RNA-seq comparing male <italic toggle=""yes"">Mecp2</italic> null to wild-type controls yielded few differentially expressed gene (DEG) transcripts<sup><xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR21"">21</xref>–<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR24"">24</xref></sup>. However, bulk analyses of transcript levels in <italic toggle=""yes"">Mecp2</italic> null compared to <italic toggle=""yes"">Mecp2</italic> duplication mouse brain revealed 2582 altered DEGs in hypothalamus<sup><xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR25"">25</xref></sup>, 1180 DEG transcripts in cerebellum<sup><xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR26"">26</xref></sup>, and 1060 DEGs in amygdala<sup><xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR27"">27</xref></sup>. Interestingly, analysis of transcripts in individual brain cell types yielded non-overlapping lists of DEGs suggesting that bulk tissue DEG analysis suffers from a “dilution effect” potentially masking DEGs<sup><xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR28"">28</xref></sup>. While these initial studies comparing <italic toggle=""yes"">Mecp2</italic> null to wild-type and <italic toggle=""yes"">Mecp2</italic> duplication control male brains can reveal gene targets of MeCP2 in vivo, <italic toggle=""yes"">Mecp2</italic><sup><italic toggle=""yes"">-/+</italic></sup> female mice are the relevant model for understanding RTT, where brain cell-autonomous and non-autonomous effects require analysis of individual cells and cell types. For autosomal genes, heterozygous mutations are expected to show reduced phenotypic severity than the homozygous state, but for X-linked genes, there is the added complication of random XCI that creates epigenetic mosaicism within cell populations. We were able to utilize snRNA-seq 5’ in the <italic toggle=""yes"">Mecp2e1</italic> mouse model to parse by both cortical cell type and mutation to improve understanding of transcriptional dysregulation in RTT. Our results can both help confirm certain aspects of previous bulk transcriptomic studies and help explain some of the prior discrepancies between bulk transcriptomic studies in RTT mouse models. A study using bulk RNA-seq on 7-week-old <italic toggle=""yes"">Mecp2</italic> null mice showed 48 genes upregulated and 32 genes down-regulated in pathways such as circadian entrainment that are consistent with our single nucleus data, despite the lower overall number of DEGs identified<sup><xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR29"">29</xref></sup>. We identified circadian entrainment as a homeostatic gene pathway dynamically dysregulated in Pvalb and Sst at P30, L5 excitatory neurons at P60, and astrocytes at P150 in <italic toggle=""yes"">Mecp2e1</italic><sup><italic toggle=""yes"">-/+</italic></sup> cortices. To date, there has been only one prior study conducted using single nucleus RNA-seq in both RTT brain and a mouse model. Renthal et al. used <italic toggle=""yes"">Mecp2</italic> null cortex at a single time point (8 weeks for males, 12-20 weeks for females) and compared to human RTT cortex with <italic toggle=""yes"">MECP2</italic> 255X<sup><xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR16"">16</xref></sup>. Our studies were consistent in finding both up- and down-regulated genes with MeCP2 deficiency across cell types and in finding evidence for non-cell-autonomous gene dysregulation, but inconsistent in demonstrating a significant effect of MeCP2 deficiency on repression of long genes. However, differences between the study designs, including genetic mouse model, time points, statistical approaches for DEGs, and single cell technology (iDrops versus 5’ V2 technology) could explain the discrepancies. We specifically designed the current study to overcome some of the prior technical limitations, including improvement in signal to noise ratio<sup><xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR30"">30</xref></sup>, higher number of genes detected per nucleus, higher UMI per nucleus, and higher number of cells analyzed<sup><xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR31"">31</xref></sup>. Furthermore, we used 3,000 marker genes from the Allen brain atlas cortex single nucleus dataset to label cell types (compared to one marker gene per cell) and used five different statistical approaches to robustly identify differentially expressed genes. To understand how transcriptional dysregulation in RTT cortex is related to symptom progression, our study uniquely utilized a longitudinal study design and systems biology approaches to correlate networks of dysregulated gene expression patterns with disease phenotypes over time. Remarkably, these disease-relevant gene networks were not specific to individual cell types, but instead were enriched in pathways also dysregulated in neurodegenerative disorders and addiction pathways that regulate brain homeostasis across cell types, including metabolism, circadian entrainment, and retrograde endocannabinoid signaling. Previous studies had shown a link between MeCP2 and addiction<sup><xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR32"">32</xref></sup> that involve <italic toggle=""yes"">Arc</italic> and <italic toggle=""yes"">Junb</italic> transcription, consistent with our results in <italic toggle=""yes"">Mecp2e1</italic><sup><italic toggle=""yes"">-/y</italic></sup> cortical cells<sup><xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR33"">33</xref></sup> and KEGG pathways enriched in <italic toggle=""yes"">Mecp2e1</italic><sup><italic toggle=""yes"">-/+</italic></sup> cortical cells. A prior study showing that selective deletion of <italic toggle=""yes"">Mecp2</italic> from excitatory neurons had no effect on excitatory transmission but reduced inhibitory synapse numbers and neurotransmission in the somatosensory and prefrontal cortex<sup><xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR34"">34</xref></sup> is consistent with our results showing a spread of dysregulated gene pathways from excitatory to inhibitory neurons. A more recent study investigating neurons and astrocytes found KEGG pathways such as calcium signaling pathway and Rap1 signaling pathway were enriched in RTT, consistent with our findings<sup><xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR35"">35</xref></sup>. While non-cell autonomous effects have been previously noted in RTT mouse models, our comprehensive analyses of cellular transcriptomes over disease progression implicates these effects as a central and defining feature of transcriptional dysregulation in RTT mosaic females. Sun et al. argue that the abnormal morphologies of neurons and astrocytes in human RTT are caused by non-cell-autonomous effects driven by altered gene expression and enriched energy related KEGG pathways, consistent with our findings from experiment 2<sup><xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR35"">35</xref></sup>. Defects in signaling pathways suggests RTT disease progression is not caused exclusively by autonomous transcriptional changes in individual cells, but rather due to a failure of wild-type <italic toggle=""yes"">MECP2</italic> expressing cells to compensate for mutant <italic toggle=""yes"">MECP2</italic> expressing cells. Since RTT in humans almost exclusively affects females, our results have important implications for translational medicine. First, pre-clinical models for testing new therapies should be female and construct-relevant, ideally modeling actual human RTT mutations. While male <italic toggle=""yes"">Mecp2</italic> null models provide important basic insights into MeCP2 function, we clearly demonstrate that the <italic toggle=""yes"">Mecp2e1</italic> deficient males do not recapitulate the transcriptional dysregulation observed in RTT human cortical cells as well as their female mutant littermates. Furthermore, the non-cell-autonomous dynamic waves of dysregulation in WT-expressing cortical neurons may help explain why human RTT symptoms appear gradually and are staggered in a series of regressions followed by plateaus. Our results showing that transcriptional dysregulation appears pre-symptomatic in female <italic toggle=""yes"">Mecp2e1</italic> mutant across multiple cortical cell types suggest that diagnosis and treatment should ideally begin as early as possible, potentially by including <italic toggle=""yes"">MECP2</italic> in newborn screening panels. To date, the only drug in the market for RTT is Trofinetide which is based on IGF-1 a growth factor previously used for diseases such as Laron syndrome and liver cirrhosis<sup><xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR36"">36</xref>,<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR37"">37</xref></sup>. The overlap with other neurologic disease pathways including oxidative phosphorylation suggests that some existing drugs for neurodegenerative disorders could potentially be repurposed to counteract some of the RTT non-cell-autonomous transcriptional dysregulations in pathways regulating homeostasis. Conversely, the molecular pathogenesis of RTT may provide insights for understanding epigenetic regulation of transcriptional homeostasis of gene pathways relevant to common neurodegenerative and addiction disorders.

  ICV delivery of AAV to restore the target gene expression is a crucial technique in gene therapy strategies for neurodevelopmental disorders such as Rett syndrome. This protocol offers a method for administering AAV into the cerebral ventricles of pup, ensuring high coverage, low hepatotoxicity, and efficient and sustained expression. To compare the efficacy of intraventricular injection with that of other commonly used viral injection approaches, we compared the viral expression in the brain and hepatotoxicity produced by the different modes of injection 30 days after viral injection (<xref rid=""fig3"" ref-type=""fig"">Figure 3</xref>A). With the facial intravenous (FIV) injection contrast, ICV delivery of virus is more accurate in hippocampus and cortex, whose functions are critical for autism research. Immunofluorescent staining reveals effective virus expression of ICV in brain regions such as the cortex and hippocampus at 30 days post-injection, which is consistent with the results of previous study<xref rid=""bib6"" ref-type=""bibr""><sup>6</sup></xref> (<xref rid=""fig3"" ref-type=""fig"">Figures 3</xref>B and <xref rid=""fig4"" ref-type=""fig"">4</xref>A). In addition, ICV delivery shows milder hepatotoxicity compared with tail intravenous (TIV) injection, which is a common intravenous delivery approach of virus injection.<xref rid=""bib7"" ref-type=""bibr""><sup>7</sup></xref> We determine the concentrations of alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) in serum via FIV, TIV and ICV delivery and find the ICV delivery is less toxic (<xref rid=""fig3"" ref-type=""fig"">Figures 3</xref>C and 3D). At the same time, intravenous injection results in more virus consumption (<xref rid=""fig3"" ref-type=""fig"">Figure 3</xref>B). In contract with FIV and TIV, ICV injection causes less hepatotoxicity, consumes less virus, and intervenes earlier in pups (<xref rid=""tbl3"" ref-type=""table"">Table 3</xref>).<fig id=""fig3""><label>Figure 3</label><caption><p>Viral transduction efficacy and hepatotoxicity of intracerebroventricular (ICV) injection and other vein injections</p><p>(A) Schematic diagram of injection site and experimental timeline of ICV injection, facial vein injection (FIV) and tail vein injection (TIV).

By immunoblotting, the MECP2 expression level of the brain of <italic toggle=""yes"">Mecp2</italic><sup>-/y</sup> mice restores to 79.1% of that in <italic toggle=""yes"">Mecp2</italic><sup>+/y</sup> mice 30 days after AAV delivery, and reaches 82.8% at 60 days; and still remains at 64.6% even at 120 days, demonstrating high efficacy and persistence with this protocol (<xref rid=""fig4"" ref-type=""fig"">Figures 4</xref>B and 4C). To separate the cortex, hippocampus and hypothalamus, the MECP2 expression level also remains at a high level (<xref rid=""fig4"" ref-type=""fig"">Figures 4</xref>D–4I). Therefore, this protocol can be extended to preclinical gene therapy research targeting the pup brain for various neurodevelopmental disorders.<xref rid=""bib8"" ref-type=""bibr""><sup>8</sup></xref> The protocol offers a simple and efficient technique for neonatal ICV delivery of AAV. The complete entry of AAV into the cerebrospinal fluid within the ventricles determines brain coverage. Intraventricular injection solves the problem of intracranial pressure and toxicity caused by direct injection into the brain parenchyma. However, the injection technique in this protocol primarily relies on the experimenter’s surgical experience without the benefit of the assistance of ultrasound visualization techniques.<xref rid=""bib9"" ref-type=""bibr""><sup>9</sup></xref> Therefore, it is crucial to continually assess the depth of the glass capillary needle and make adjustments as needed during the experiment (refer to <xref rid=""sec6"" ref-type=""sec"">troubleshooting</xref>). Indeed, balancing viral expression strength with viral toxicity is a critical issue that must be fully considered in all gene therapy projects. For genes (such as <italic toggle=""yes"">Mecp2</italic>) that are widely expressed in various types of cells throughout the brain, including neurons, astrocytes, microglia, etc., the key to achieving efficient and sustained expression in the brain is to realize widespread and mild overexpression in different cell types. The cytomegalovirus immediate-early enhancer/chicken β-actin (CAG) promoter used in this protocol drives widespread and mild overexpression of the target gene in different cell types. However, further screening and validation are needed to determine whether other broad-spectrum promoters may have better effects. For genes that are limited to express in synaptic structures (such as <italic toggle=""yes"">Shank3</italic>), the human Synapsin (hSyn) promoter has more advantages in specificity for cell. How to ensure the sustained expression of the viral vectors is also worth noting. The technique in this protocol involves only a single injection, which is able to remain sustained expression until adulthood (<xref rid=""fig4"" ref-type=""fig"">Figure 4</xref>). However, the exogenously injected viral vectors will inevitably be cleared over time after slow metabolism within the brain. Therefore, a single injection strategy may not be sufficient to cover the entire lifespan.   We thank Jundong Zhuang, Yonghong Wang, Linxiao Yue, and Song Guo for excellent technical assistance.

7027 A Rare And Multifactorial Etiology Of Severe Parathyroid Hormone Independent Hypercalcemia In An Adult Female With Rett Syndrome,"
<bold>Disclosure: M.I. Foo:</bold> None. <bold>M. Thompson:</bold> None. 
<bold>Background:</bold> Symptomatic hypercalcemia is a rare, but potentially life-threatening disorder. Although dehydration is an unusual cause of severe hypercalcemia, in the appropriate clinical setting dehydration may amplify underlying mild or moderate hypercalcemia to dangerous levels.Case: A 46-year-old non-verbal, non-mobile Caucasian female with Rett Syndrome (RS) with Stage III Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD3) who is dependent on percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) tube for nutrition and known PTH independent hypercalcemia of unknown etiology presented to the hospital with intractable vomiting and constipation, an outpatient serum calcium level of 16.0 mg/dL, and serum creatinine 4.03 mg/dL (baseline 1.2 mg/dL). Initial laboratory assessment revealed elevated corrected serum calcium levels (15.7 mg/dL), with appropriately suppressed PTH levels (12.5 pg/mL) and hypernatremia (146 mmol/L). Thyroid function tests, both Vitamin D 1,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D and D 25(OH)D levels and PTH-RP were normal. Computed tomography of the abdomen and pelvis revealed bilateral nephrolithiasis and moderate stool burden, but no evidence of malignancy or granulomatous disease. Skeletal scintigraphy was also without evidence of osseous metastatic disease or Paget’s disease of bone. An in-depth interview with the patient’s caregiver uncovered that the patient had a relative intolerance to enteral hydration and had been receiving minimal water flushes prior to admission, contributing to severe dehydration. Hypercalcemia was ultimately ascribed to prolonged immobilization due to RS compounded by inadequate fluid intake and auto-diuresis secondary to hypercalciuria in the setting of CKD (prior baseline eGFR 45 mL/min/1.73m<sup>2</sup>).Outcome: The patient's hypercalcemia improved after a multidisciplinary and multi-directed approach involving intravenous and enteral fluid resuscitation, calcitonin, furosemide, and ultimately zoledronic acid following improvement in creatinine with fluid resuscitation. The dietary service employed a strategy of 24-hour enteral feeding, increasing both the frequency and amount of enteral water, which the patient tolerated well, and provided her with a new pump for home use. Education on monitoring tube feed tolerance and providing adequate enteral hydration was provided to both the caregiver and group home. On discharge, eGFR stabilized at 33 mL/min/1.73m<sup>2</sup> and corrected calcium stabilized at 10.0–10.4 mg/dl. She was provided with an endocrinology follow-up to continue bisphosphonate therapy.Discussion: Hypercalcemia of immobility should remain a differential diagnosis in severe hypercalcemia, especially PEG tube dependent patients with underlying kidney disease. This case highlights the importance of thorough history taking and a multidisciplinary strategy to guarantee optimal care and mitigate potential adverse outcomes in medically complex patients.

Effects of Immersive Virtual Reality with Treadmill in Subjects with Rett Syndrome: A Pilot Study,"Background/Objectives: Rett syndrome is a rare neurodevelopmental disorder that can severely affect motor functioning, particularly walking. Previous training programs proposed treadmills as tools to increase walking endurance of patients with Rett syndrome, but these trainings did not include virtual reality (VR). The aim of this study was to assess the feasibility of a short treadmill training coupled to VR in girls with Rett syndrome. Methods: Nine patients with Rett syndrome underwent a 3-day treadmill walking program performed in semi-immersive VR. During the training, the happiness index and performance metrics were collected. At the end of the training parents filled out the Suitability Evaluation Questionnaire (SEQ) and, when feasible, patients underwent a gait assessment. Results: All the subjects recruited performed the three GRAIL sessions and parents showed a good satisfaction and considered the integration of treadmill and VR a good possibility for future rehabilitative programs. Participants showed greater satisfaction in environments requiring walking and their attention increased during training sessions, hypothesizing the feasibility of longer trainings with treadmill and VR. Data collected from gait analysis provided insights, although preliminary, concerning differences in gait pattern amongst the recruited subjects. Conclusions: Despite the small sample size and limited training duration, the paper suggests that a walking training with a treadmill combined with VR can represent a new strategy for Rett rehabilitation.","Rett syndrome (RTT) is a rare severe neurodevelopmental disorder caused by mutations in the <italic toggle=""yes"">MecP2</italic> gene, which mostly affects females. Manifestation occurs generally in the first years of life, between 6 and 18 months of age with a regression of acquired skills, after an apparently normal or slightly delayed development. This regression is followed by a stable period, during which subjects with RTT show heterogeneous clinical situations [<xref rid=""B1-children-11-01110"" ref-type=""bibr"">1</xref>]. The clinical representations are characterized by different degrees of cognitive disability and motor impairments such as fluctuation of muscle tone, loss of trunk and balance control, scoliosis and loss of purposeful hand use [<xref rid=""B2-children-11-01110"" ref-type=""bibr"">2</xref>]. The later stage of the disease is characterized by osteotendineous retractions and progressive immobility.  Considering walking abilities, Young et al. [<xref rid=""B3-children-11-01110"" ref-type=""bibr"">3</xref>] observed that freezing, veering, foot dragging, parkinsonian shuffling, antepulsion or retropulsion and hand stereotypes characterize overground and treadmill walking of subjects with RTT. Isaias et al. [<xref rid=""B4-children-11-01110"" ref-type=""bibr"">4</xref>] also underlined that subjects with RTT show a medium-lateral displacement during gait initiation, with a low activation of dorsiflexor of the ankle, a wide base of support and compensatory rotational movements of the trunk. The scarce representation of movement and the lack of feedforward control may be associated with sensory integration alterations, that may impact the walking function [<xref rid=""B5-children-11-01110"" ref-type=""bibr"">5</xref>,<xref rid=""B6-children-11-01110"" ref-type=""bibr"">6</xref>,<xref rid=""B7-children-11-01110"" ref-type=""bibr"">7</xref>]. Lifelong motor rehabilitation is fundamental in subjects with RTT to maintain and improve their abilities and their quality of life through all the phases of the syndrome. According to a systematic review [<xref rid=""B8-children-11-01110"" ref-type=""bibr"">8</xref>], the interventions performed for girls with RTT include education, traditional physiotherapy, environmental enrichment, hydrotherapy, treadmill training, sensory-based treatment, computerized systems and music therapy. Specific balance exercises, eye/feet coordination, walking on different surfaces and crossing obstacles are some of the goals in motor rehabilitation [<xref rid=""B4-children-11-01110"" ref-type=""bibr"">4</xref>]. Regarding gait training, there is some evidence that walking on a treadmill may improve physical and aerobic fitness in subjects with RTT [<xref rid=""B9-children-11-01110"" ref-type=""bibr"">9</xref>,<xref rid=""B10-children-11-01110"" ref-type=""bibr"">10</xref>,<xref rid=""B11-children-11-01110"" ref-type=""bibr"">11</xref>]. In these studies, kinematic data were not reported.  Since the advent of virtual reality (VR), it has been extensively applied in the field of neurorehabilitation. The rationale of using VR is that it encourages and motivates the subjects to participate in the rehabilitation processes, while training in a safe environment which allows repeated learning trials [<xref rid=""B12-children-11-01110"" ref-type=""bibr"">12</xref>]. When coupled with treadmill training, VR increased engagement and offered augmented feedback, improving motor function, movement kinematics, quality of life and participation in children with cerebral palsy and adults with chronic stroke [<xref rid=""B13-children-11-01110"" ref-type=""bibr"">13</xref>,<xref rid=""B14-children-11-01110"" ref-type=""bibr"">14</xref>,<xref rid=""B15-children-11-01110"" ref-type=""bibr"">15</xref>].  Although results are promising, few studies investigated the effect of VR in subjects with RTT: Mraz et al. [<xref rid=""B16-children-11-01110"" ref-type=""bibr"">16</xref>] reported, in their single case study, that training with a VR device seems to be effective in increasing hand use. In two other studies, subjects with RTT appear to be highly motivated by new technologies, particularly when including avatars in VR environments [<xref rid=""B17-children-11-01110"" ref-type=""bibr"">17</xref>,<xref rid=""B18-children-11-01110"" ref-type=""bibr"">18</xref>].  Considering the feasibility to use a treadmill with RTT and the engaging capabilities of VR, in this study we decided to assess if a short treadmill training coupled with VR activity is feasible in subjects with RTT. Specifically, the main aim of the present study was to investigate (1) the suitability of the system and the motivation of the patients during the training and (2) the motor responses of subjects with RTT in a setting of immersive virtual reality treadmill walking.   Nine female subjects (age range 6–44 years old, median (IQR) = 16 (4)) were recruited according to the inclusion criteria. Data are reported in <xref rid=""children-11-01110-t001"" ref-type=""table"">Table 1</xref>.  As shown in <xref rid=""children-11-01110-t001"" ref-type=""table"">Table 1</xref>, the patients had a level of severity of syndrome from severe to mild (RARS total scores), with a median (IQR) value of 60.5 (8.5), meaning that they showed severe physical, language and social impairments. This clinical feature was expected because RTT is a severe disorder associated with deficits in several domains. With regard to motor functioning, it was moderately associated with the degree of severity of RTT (according to the RSGMS total scores). All participants performed the three training sessions (T1, T2 and T3) in one week according to the protocol.  After the first training, it was decided to remove APP1 from the list of the exergames. This app was selected in order to assess the ability of subjects to understand the motor request and to interact with the system by moving their body left or right to perform the exergame. Unluckily, this task was too difficult for the subjects and, when this game was not conducted properly, the visual biofeedback was too confusing.  All parents completed the SEQ. Gait analysis was possible only for four subjects. The following sections show results related to outcome measures, i.e., happiness index, endurance time, performance speed, attention focus on scenario (<xref rid=""children-11-01110-t002"" ref-type=""table"">Table 2</xref>), SEQ and gait analysis.  In the literature, several studies have been carried out to describe the feasibility and efficacy of a walking training using a treadmill in populations of subjects affected by RTT [<xref rid=""B9-children-11-01110"" ref-type=""bibr"">9</xref>,<xref rid=""B10-children-11-01110"" ref-type=""bibr"">10</xref>,<xref rid=""B11-children-11-01110"" ref-type=""bibr"">11</xref>]. Layne et al. [<xref rid=""B9-children-11-01110"" ref-type=""bibr"">9</xref>] analyzed the gait pattern of 17 girls with RTT walking on a treadmill with a gradual increase in speed (0.1 m/s every 20 s). The authors underlined that participants could rely on sensory feedback to adapt their gait to changes in speed of the treadmill. Similarly, Larsson et al. [<xref rid=""B11-children-11-01110"" ref-type=""bibr"">11</xref>] demonstrated that, while walking on a treadmill, subjects with RTT can adapt their own speed until their maximum speed. These results seem to suggest the possibility to train subjects with RTT with a treadmill in order to increase their walking speed. Lotan et al. [<xref rid=""B10-children-11-01110"" ref-type=""bibr"">10</xref>] proposed a low-intensity daily program with a treadmill for 2 months for four subjects with RTT. The intervention improved physical and aerobic fitness of the participants suggesting that a treadmill can train the cardio-pulmonary functioning in this population. In these two studies, the authors measured physiologic signals, but not kinematics data. On the other hand, several studies have been conducted to verify the interaction of RTT subjects in a VR environment [<xref rid=""B16-children-11-01110"" ref-type=""bibr"">16</xref>,<xref rid=""B17-children-11-01110"" ref-type=""bibr"">17</xref>,<xref rid=""B18-children-11-01110"" ref-type=""bibr"">18</xref>], but they were mainly addressed to upper limb functions and cognitive interaction.  Therefore, this is the first study in which a short training combining treadmill and VR environment is proposed for subjects with RTT. The study investigated (1) the suitability of the system and the motivation of the patients during the training and (2) the motor responses of subjects with RTT during training. The first aim was fulfilled considering the adherence of patients to the training, the SEQ, the happiness index and the attention focus to scenarios. The second aim was achieved by means of the endurance time and performance speed measures as well as gait analysis data when available.  Considering the feasibility, all the subjects recruited were able to complete the three GRAIL sessions and with four of them it was possible to conduct a gait analysis. Moreover, the parents of participants showed a good satisfaction and considered the integration of the treadmill and VR a good possibility for future rehabilitative projects. Considering the happiness index, the participants showed greater satisfaction in APP2 and APP3 during which they walked over the treadmill, in comparison to APP4, during which the task was performed in static conditions.  Interestingly, our preliminary data may suggest that patients with RTT increase their attention toward the scenario and task during training sessions, hypothesizing the feasibility of longer trainings with a treadmill and VR. Considering the second aim of the paper, according to data collected, the most durable activity was APP4. This may be due to the fact that it was the only activity that did not require walking and it is possible that patients got tired more slowly. Regarding gait speed, data reported in this manuscript may suggest that the gait speed can gradually increase during the training. The gait analysis was feasible in four patients. The median walking speed was 0.5 ms<sup>−2</sup>, a value higher than the mean speed reached during the three sessions. This is due to the fact that only patients that showed greater endurance and safety during walking could accede to gait analysis, while data for mean speed during training were collected from all the subjects recruited. With this median speed, participants had a median stride time equal to 1.33 s that is longer than the one reported by Layne et al. [<xref rid=""B9-children-11-01110"" ref-type=""bibr"">9</xref>], where the median stride time at a similar speed was between 1.21 s and 1.17 s. The four subjects that underwent the gait assessment showed some common characteristics, such as a global stiffness and, accordingly, the active ROM reduction in lower limbs, the lack in push-off activity in the pre-swing phase and an increase in the stance time.  Considering the ROM, the study of Layne et al. included participants with severe stiffness that limited hip movement to a maximum ROM of 12° and knee ROM to a maximum of 10° [<xref rid=""B9-children-11-01110"" ref-type=""bibr"">9</xref>]. In contrast, the participants that underwent the gait analysis in this study had a median hip ROM of 36.25° and a median knee ROM of 49.25°. This means that the subjects that could undergo the gait analysis showed a less impaired gait pattern. The lack of plantar flexion during the pre-swing phase (healthy subjects usually exhibit 15° of plantar flexion [<xref rid=""B27-children-11-01110"" ref-type=""bibr"">27</xref>]) seems to suggest the deficiency in push-off activity of gastrocnemius and soleus muscles, and this can contribute to the reduction in stride length and in walking speed. Finally, the increase in stance time, directly related to the duration of single-limb support, is a consequence of the difficulty in properly managing the balance of center of mass. On the other hand, additionally to these common behaviors, each subject showed peculiar characteristics. The mean walking speed, for example, was very different between P2 (0.66 m/s) and P5 (0.25 m/s). P2 was markedly asymmetrical, while P8 showed similar kinematics for left and right lower limbs; P5 was the most symmetric, but presented the most limited ROM, and this can explain this symmetry. During walking, P3 could achieve hip and knee extension, particularly in the late stance, while P8 remained with the knee flexed during the whole gait cycle. These results suggest that in addition to some common characteristics, subjects with RTT show specific gait pattern alteration. For a correct interpretation of these results, we have to consider the limitations of this study. This is indeed a pilot study with a small simple size. Therefore, it is necessary to increase the sample size to confirm the results obtained. In addition, the age range of the sample is broad (6–44 yo); nevertheless, this is common in research papers about subjects with RTT. However, our results must be verified in a larger sample. On the other hand, it is important to consider that RTT is a rare syndrome, limiting the possibility to recruit a big sample with a narrow age range. Future studies could use the methodologies of this pilot study with a large sample of patients, taking into account their age, to replicate our findings.  Secondly, considering that for safety reasons the presence of any person in close proximity of the device was not possible, we decided to take a cautious approach (e.g., stopping the treadmill as soon as the subjects showed signs of discomfort or started veering). This limited the possibility to determine the effective maximum speed during the training. Finally, although the purpose of this study was to verify the suitability of a treadmill training plus VR in patients with RTT and not its efficacy, we must consider the short duration of each session and the reduced dose of the therapy. Indeed, this study was preliminary to future research that will recommend more intensive training with this system as previously performed [<xref rid=""B14-children-11-01110"" ref-type=""bibr"">14</xref>].  Nevertheless, this system may have strong clinical implications in the rehabilitation practice of children, adolescents and adults with RTT. Indeed, enhanced motivation and engagement fostered by exergames in virtual reality can support longer training sessions that may cause improved walking endurance. This may consequently boost autonomy in daily life activities, thus improving quality of life of patients with RTT. It is therefore possible to hypothesize that treadmill training combined with VR could be a valid treatment for motor functions in RTT. Future research will be conducted to validate this type of treatment in a randomized controlled trial. In conclusion, this study demonstrated that subjects with RTT tolerated the treadmill plus VR training well, without showing signs of discomfort or dizziness. The endurance time in all the activities increased gradually. Among the activities proposed, subjects liked the three applications that required more automatic movements more, such as walking and maintaining balance over the platform. Furthermore, kinematic data during walking were reported for the first time in this population, highlighting some common features but also a high variability in this population. Hence, the present study suggests that this approach, consisting of a treadmill integrated with VR, is feasible and tolerable in subjects with RTT.",N/A,11 9 2024
A meta-analysis of the efficacy and safety of trofinetide in patients with rett syndrome,,"Rett syndrome (RTT) is an x-linked neurodevelopmental disease that primarily affects females, with an incidence between 1:10,000 and 1:15000 [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR1"">1</xref>]. RTT develops due to a gene mutation on the long arm (q) of the X chromosome. Methyl CpG-binding protein 2 (MECP2) is the protein that the gene encodes. The primary role of MECP2 is the activation and suppression of transcription, which is crucial for the maturation of neurons and their functions. Therefore, suppression of the gene leads to wide disruption of the activity of many other genes and defects the epigenetic regulatory molecules [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR2"">2</xref>–<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR4"">4</xref>]. RTT syndrome presents itself with different variants. In the first six months of life, the classic RTT starts with normal development, which is followed by years of development regression. The symptoms are classified into four stages: stagnation (age 6–18 months), rapid regression (age 1–4 years), pseudo-stationary (age 2–potentially life), and late motor deterioration (age 10–life). [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR4"">4</xref>–<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR6"">6</xref>]. Patients present in different ways, which results in a variety of neuromotor and cognitive disabilities. Symptoms begin with some autistic behaviors such as complete or partial loss of expressive language, failure to maintain eye contact in addition to loss of purposeful hand movement and impaired gait [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR7"">7</xref>–<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR9"">9</xref>]. Recently there is evidence that atypical behaviors could start to appear before the regression begins, indicating that the syndrome is not entirely symptom-free in the first few months of life. [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR10"">10</xref>, <xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR11"">11</xref>] Until recent years treatment of RTT depended mainly on controlling the symptoms. Management of all the disabilities requires a multidisciplinary approach which varies from physiotherapy of the affected muscles to controlling some neurological symptoms such as seizures [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR12"">12</xref>]. The advance in neurological research to improve cognitive function has made new discoveries in a lot of neurological disorders. Trofinetide (glycyl-L-2-methylpropyl-L-glutamic acid) is a synthetic analog of glycine–proline–glutamate (GPE), a natural tripeptide in the brain that has a neuroprotective effect on the neurons. In mouse trials, both Trofinetide and GPE improve respiratory and cardiac functions as well as increase brain weight in MECP2 deficient mice [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR13"">13</xref>]. These observations led to the conduct of new randomized trials to investigate Trofinetide's impact on RTT patients. This study's objective is to review that database and assess the efficacy and negative effects of Trofinetide on RTT patients.   Three RCTs with 325 RTT patients were included comparing Trofinetide to placebo showing statistically significant difference on the CGI implying that Trofinetide has a positive effect on the clinical condition of RTT patients. Trofinetide, also achieved better RSBQ scores compared to placebo, however and according to Hou 2020 [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR21"">21</xref>] the RSBQ has its limitations and potential problems when applied in clinical trials for RTT, so it would be unwise to completely rely on RSBQ to determine the efficacy of the drug. Based on these results Trofinetide could target the key symptoms of RTT such as impaired communication, compulsive behaviors, and emotional disorders, thus improving the lives of patients and their families. Several adverse events were analyzed such as diarrhea, vomiting, fever, seizure, and irritability. There were no clear significant differences in the total rates of adverse events between Trofinetide and the placebo groups: [Neul et al., 2023] [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR20"">20</xref>]. However, most AEs were low or moderate-grade and managed with appropriate interventions [Neul et al., 2023] [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR20"">20</xref>]. When evaluating the gastrointestinal issues that mattered in this evaluation, including diarrhea and vomiting. Diarrhea was more common with Trofinetide but was typically transient, resolving on drug cessation, while vomiting tended to be more frequent in the control group suggesting that subjects on placebo have a poorer tolerance [Neul et al., 2023] [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR20"">20</xref>]. No significant difference was found between Trofinetide and placebo for pyrexia (fever), seizures, and irritability indicating that Trofinetide did not aggravate those symptoms in RTT patients. A meta-analysis of three RCTs on Trofinetide in RTT patients revealed statistically significant improvements in CGI and RSBQ scores, suggesting potential clinical benefits. Safety analysis showed minor adverse events with relatively low risk. This comprehensive review provides an overall view of Trofinetide's effectiveness and safety in treating RTT symptoms, indicating its promise as a treatment option. The incorporated RCTs showed limited lengths of 1–3 months of post-discharge follow-up. It constrained our capacity to evaluate the durability of security and viability of Trofinetide with RTT sufferers over the long haul. Also. some safety outcomes, including adverse events, showed heterogeneity in our analysis, so these results cannot be generalized to the whole population of patients with RTT, as such heterogeneity could be attributed to the differences in drug doses, patients’ attributes, or other reasons among the included trials; Glaze 2017 examined mainly adolescents and adults while the other two trials included children; the youngest patient in Glaze 2017 was 15 years old with mean age 25 years, on the other hand, Glaze 2019 examined patients between the ages of 5 and 15, therefore Glaze 2017 and Glaze 2019 are not examining the same patient’s populations. Glaze 2019 performed its final efficacy analysis at day 54, while Glazed 2019 measured its efficacy outcomes at day 66 (almost 9.5 weeks) and Neuls 2023 measured its efficacy at 12 weeks, a follow up duration of approximately twice as long Glaze 2019. Also, the three studies used completely different doses of Trofinetide; Glaze 2017 used two doses (35 mg and 70 mg), while Glaze 2019 used three doses of the drug (50, 100, 200 mg) and Neul 2023 used different doses ranging from (200 to 500 mg). It is also important to note that Glaze 2017 showed high risk of bias by using RoB 2 and Neul 2023 showed some concerns, while Glaze 2019 showed low risk of bias which could also be attributed to the heterogeneity among them. Although, there was some heterogeneity among the three studies it was unapplicable to perform sub-group analysis due to the lack of sufficient number of trials to be included since RTT is a rare disorder and Trofinetide is a new drug that is not widely available. The trial underscores the importance of consistent reporting of safety results from clinical studies in the future. Long-Term Follow-up: It would be of value for future research to have longer-term outcomes investigating the sustainability of the impact and to offer some information on the long-term safety profile of Trofinetide. Dose Optimization: Future research on dose optimization is needed to identify the optimal and most tolerable doses of Trofinetide for various ages and types of RTT. This might be used to personalize medication methods to every single person’s needs. Biomarker Development: Work should be done to find biomarkers to determine which Trofinetide-induced physiologic, neurocognitive, or behavioral changes may have occurred. It would help us to uncover the mechanism of action responsible for how it works and give us a better idea as to whether someone is responding well to their treatment. Inclusion of Diverse Populations: Extending the study participants' age range (to children and adolescents with Rett syndrome) will offer a better understanding of Trofinetide effectiveness and safety. Overall, the results from our meta-analysis imply that Trofinetide has the potential to be an effective therapy for the classic features of Rett syndrome, nevertheless improvements must be done for future studies regarding the heterogeneity and the follow up duration.",N/A,21 5 2024
"The Alpha-Synuclein Gene (<italic toggle=""yes"">SNCA</italic>) is a Genomic Target of Methyl-CpG Binding Protein 2 (MeCP2)—Implications for Parkinson’s Disease and Rett Syndrome","Mounting evidence suggests a prominent role for alpha-synuclein (a-syn) in neuronal cell function. Alterations in the levels of cellular a-syn have been hypothesized to play a critical role in the development of Parkinson’s disease (PD); however, mechanisms that control expression of the gene for a-syn (<italic toggle=""yes"">SNCA</italic>) in <italic toggle=""yes"">cis</italic> and <italic toggle=""yes"">trans</italic> as well as turnover of a-syn are not well understood. We analyzed whether methyl-CpG binding protein 2 (MeCP2), a protein that specifically binds methylated DNA, thus regulating transcription, binds at predicted binding sites in intron 1 of the <italic toggle=""yes"">SNCA</italic> gene and regulates a-syn protein expression<italic toggle=""yes"">.</italic> Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) and electrophoretic mobility-shift assays (EMSA) were used to confirm binding of MeCP2 to regulatory regions of <italic toggle=""yes"">SNCA</italic>. Site-specific methylation and introduction of localized mutations by CRISPR/Cas9 were used to investigate the binding properties of MeCP2 in human SK-N-SH neuroblastoma cells. The significance of MeCP2 for <italic toggle=""yes"">SNCA</italic> regulation was further investigated by overexpressing MeCP2 and mutated variants of MeCP2 in <italic toggle=""yes"">MeCP2</italic> knockout cells. We found that methylation-dependent binding of MeCP2 at a restricted region of intron 1 of <italic toggle=""yes"">SNCA</italic> had a significant impact on the production of a-syn. A single nucleotide substitution near to CpG1 strongly increased the binding of MeCP2 to intron 1 of <italic toggle=""yes"">SNCA</italic> and decreased a-syn protein expression by 60%. In contrast, deletion of a single nucleotide closed to CpG2 led to reduced binding of MeCP2 and significantly increased a-syn levels. In accordance, knockout of <italic toggle=""yes"">MeCP2</italic> in SK-N-SH cells resulted in a significant increase in a-syn production, demonstrating that <italic toggle=""yes"">SNCA</italic> is a genomic target for MeCP2 regulation. In addition, the expression of two mutated MeCP2 variants found in Rett syndrome (RTT) showed a loss of their ability to reduce a-syn expression. This study demonstrates that methylation of CpGs and binding of MeCP2 to intron 1 of the <italic toggle=""yes"">SNCA</italic> gene plays an important role in the control of a-syn expression. In addition, the changes in <italic toggle=""yes"">SNCA</italic> regulation found by expression of MeCP2 variants carrying mutations found in RTT patients may be of importance for the elucidation of a new molecular pathway in RTT, a rare neurological disorder caused by mutations in <italic toggle=""yes"">MECP2</italic>.","Alpha-synuclein (a-syn) is an abundant protein in mammalian neurons and numerous cells in the hematopoietic lineage. It has been implicated in various cellular functions, and the altered expression of the gene for a-syn (<italic toggle=""yes"">SNCA</italic>) has profound effects on many intracellular processes [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR1"">1</xref>]. a-syn is a major component of Lewy bodies, the pathological hallmark found in both familial and sporadic Parkinson’s disease (PD) patients [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR2"">2</xref>, <xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR3"">3</xref>]. In kindreds with <italic toggle=""yes"">SNCA</italic> multiplication and familial parkinsonism, increased a-syn dose-dependently results in severe parkinsonian phenotypes [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR4"">4</xref>]. Several studies have identified significant risk haplotypes for sporadic PD (sPD) that are predicted to regulate <italic toggle=""yes"">SNCA</italic> expression (PDbase; [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR5"">5</xref>]). Extensive promoter analyses and studies of <italic toggle=""yes"">SNCA</italic> mRNA in dopaminergic neurons (DN) showed that genotype-dependent regulatory mechanisms of <italic toggle=""yes"">SNCA</italic> expression contribute to the risk of sPD, and a recent study revealed that its expression in brain <italic toggle=""yes"">in vivo</italic> is regulated predominantly by intronic enhancers [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR6"">6</xref>–<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR9"">9</xref>]. Previous studies have independently identified intron 1 as a regulatory region of <italic toggle=""yes"">SNCA</italic> with expression-relevant GATA binding sites and NGF response elements in intron 1 of rodent <italic toggle=""yes"">Snca</italic> [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR10"">10</xref>, <xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR11"">11</xref>] and binding of ZSCAN21 to human <italic toggle=""yes"">SNCA</italic> intron 1 [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR12"">12</xref>]. We have shown previously that methylation of <italic toggle=""yes"">SNCA</italic><sub>(-926/-483)</sub> in intron 1 of the <italic toggle=""yes"">SNCA</italic> gene is decreased in sPD patients’ brains and represses expression of <italic toggle=""yes"">SNCA</italic>, which was confirmed in human iPSC-derived neurons by targeted editing of DNA methylation of <italic toggle=""yes"">SNCA</italic> intron 1 [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR13"">13</xref>, <xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR14"">14</xref>]. The importance of DNA methylation for a variety of conditions and functions of the central nervous system (CNS) in addition to its pivotal role in malignancies has been well demonstrated [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR15"">15</xref>]. Depending on the methylation status of CpGs within gene regulatory regions, methyl-CpG-binding domain (MBD) proteins can differentially bind and recruit co-repressor complexes to mediate transcriptional repression by a conformational change of the chromatin structure [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR16"">16</xref>, <xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR17"">17</xref>]. Some transcription factors (TF) may also bind their regulatory elements in a methylation-dependent manner [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR18"">18</xref>]. Several putative TF binding site motifs are found within a region of 23 CpG dinucleotides within <italic toggle=""yes"">SNCA</italic><sub>(-926/-483)</sub>, including methyl-CpG binding protein 2 (MeCP2) binding motifs [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR9"">9</xref>, <xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR14"">14</xref>]. MeCP2 is essential for the normal function of neurons and is a key regulator of gene transcription—it has been suggested that MeCP2 may bind to more than half of all promoters of genes expressed in the CNS [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR19"">19</xref>, <xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR20"">20</xref>]. MeCP2 has been shown to bind to methylated CpGs with A/T sequence stretches in the vicinity [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR21"">21</xref>]—although the precise identity of all target sequence motifs has not yet been fully elucidated [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR22"">22</xref>]. In addition, hydration of methylated DNA [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR23"">23</xref>], non-CG context [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR24"">24</xref>], and DNA sequence properties in <italic toggle=""yes"">cis</italic> [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR25"">25</xref>] are also important factors for the binding of MeCP2 to DNA sequences. Missense or nonsense mutations in the <italic toggle=""yes"">MeCP2</italic> gene have been linked to the etiology of Rett syndrome (RTT), a major cause of mental retardation in girls with a prevalence of about 1 in 10,000 female births [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR26"">26</xref>–<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR28"">28</xref>]. The <italic toggle=""yes"">MeCP2</italic> gene is located on the X chromosome, resulting in a mosaic of wild-type and mutant MeCP2-expressing cells in women due to X chromosome inactivation. Though all <italic toggle=""yes"">MeCP2</italic> mutations were initially thought to be lethal in males, increasing numbers have been identified recently in around 1.3 to 1.7% of males with mental retardation [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR29"">29</xref>]. Different <italic toggle=""yes"">MeCP2</italic> mutations lead to a wide spectrum of neurological disorders, ranging from mild mental retardation to severe neonatal encephalopathy [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR30"">30</xref>]. Parkinsonism is a particularly frequent symptom of RTT and <italic toggle=""yes"">MeCP2</italic> mutations [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR31"">31</xref>]. Several observations point to a mechanistic link between pathophysiological characteristics observed in PD and RTT. For example, analyses of cerebrospinal fluid from RTT patients have found reduced levels of dopamine [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR32"">32</xref>, <xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR33"">33</xref>], while another study showed a change in dopaminergic neuron (DN) metabolism related to abnormal motor movements and late motor deterioration [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR34"">34</xref>]. Changes in dopamine D2 receptors in the basal ganglia have also been reported [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR35"">35</xref>, <xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR36"">36</xref>]. Neuropathological studies support an involvement of the nigrostriatal system in RTT with a reduction in the number of DN in the substantia nigra [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR37"">37</xref>] and corresponding reduction of tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) immunoreactivity [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR38"">38</xref>] and an abnormal thinning of dendrites in the substantia nigra [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR39"">39</xref>]. A <italic toggle=""yes"">Mecp2</italic> knockout (ko) mouse model, carrying a deletion of <italic toggle=""yes"">Mecp2</italic> exons 3 and 4, showed a strong reduction in TH-expressing DN, while treatment with levodopa and a DOPA-decarboxylase inhibitor, the gold standard treatment for PD patients, markedly improved the associated behavioral abnormalities [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR40"">40</xref>, <xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR41"">41</xref>]. In another model of <italic toggle=""yes"">Mecp2</italic>-null mice, levels of norepinephrine and dopamine were reduced [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR42"">42</xref>] and TH-expressing DN diminished [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR43"">43</xref>]. Taken together, these data strongly suggest that genes implicated in the pathophysiology of PD are among the target genes of MeCP2. Here, we provide evidence for methylation-dependent binding of MeCP2 to a restricted region of <italic toggle=""yes"">SNCA</italic> intron 1. The effects of <italic toggle=""yes"">MeCP2</italic> knockout and overexpression of variants carrying the four common mutations causing RTT on a-syn levels in addition suggest that <italic toggle=""yes"">SNCA</italic> regulation could be impaired in some RTT patients.   In this study, we found that MeCP2 binds to methylated CpG1 and CpG2 sites in <italic toggle=""yes"">SCNA</italic> intron 1 and regulates expression of a-syn protein levels. Interestingly, reduction of MeCP2 levels as well as expression of mutant MeCP2 RTT variants increased a-syn expression. The increased a-syn expression in <italic toggle=""yes"">MeCP2</italic> knockout cell lines suggest an important role of MeCP2 in the regulation of <italic toggle=""yes"">SNCA</italic> expression and may indicate a loss of function in some RTT-related variants of <italic toggle=""yes"">MeCP2</italic>. 
<italic toggle=""yes"">In vitro</italic> studies suggested that MeCP2 can bind both methylated and non-methylated DNA sequences [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR48"">48</xref>]. However, in neuronal cells, where MeCP2 is highly abundant, it associates preferentially with methylated regions [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR49"">49</xref>]. For the methylation-dependent interaction, MeCP2 has been shown to require a methylated CpG and an adjacent [A/T]<sub>4</sub> motif for high-affinity DNA binding [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR22"">22</xref>]; five such potential CpG sites (CpGs 1, 2, 8, 9, and 10) reside within <italic toggle=""yes"">SNCA</italic><sub>(-926/-483)</sub>. This region contains 23 CpGs and is hypomethylated in sPD patients’ brains [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR10"">10</xref>]. Our ChIP experiments confirmed methylation-specific binding of MeCP2 at the analyzed CpGs in SK-N-SH cells. These cells showed strong methylation (~ 70%) at <italic toggle=""yes"">SNCA</italic> intron 1 while treatment with Aza effectively promoted demethylation (~ 10%). The significant decrease in methylation by Aza resulted in significant reduction of MeCP2 binding. The differences of <italic toggle=""yes"">SNCA</italic> intron 1 methylation in human brain tissues were much smaller—likewise was the reduction of MeCP2 enrichment in the corresponding ChIP experiments. DNA methylation represses transcription <italic toggle=""yes"">in vivo</italic> [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR50"">50</xref>], and MeCP2 binding mediates silencing of gene expression [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR51"">51</xref>]. Differential binding of MeCP2 with downregulation of gene expression was observed after site-specific methylation of the <italic toggle=""yes"">arginine vasopressin</italic> (<italic toggle=""yes"">Avp</italic>) gene in mice [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR44"">44</xref>]. We thus tested the impact of individual CpG sites on <italic toggle=""yes"">SNCA</italic> expression. Specific methylation of CpGs 1 and 2 in the putative binding site of MeCP2 in <italic toggle=""yes"">SNCA</italic> intron 1 was sufficient to significantly reduce expression of a reporter gene. <italic toggle=""yes"">In vitro</italic> methylation of CpGs 4-9 was less effective (68% compared to 80% for CpGs 1 and 2), and we therefore conclude that methylation of CpGs 1 and 2 in <italic toggle=""yes"">SNCA</italic> intron 1 adjacent to MeCP2 binding sites is important for the modulation of <italic toggle=""yes"">SNCA</italic> gene transcription. To evaluate whether DNA sequence variations also play a role for binding of MeCP2, we introduced localized mutations by CRISPR/Cas9-mediated editing in the immediate vicinity of CpGs 1 and 2. Interestingly, the deletion of a C (C-841d) near the CpG2 site in one of the edited cell lines created novel putative transcription factor (TF) binding sites (Supplementary Fig. S<xref rid=""MOESM1"" ref-type=""media"">3</xref>A) for the glucocorticoid receptor (GR-alpha) [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR52"">52</xref>], cellular E26 transformation-specific transcription factor 2 (c-Ets-2) [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR53"">53</xref>], the general transcription factor II-1 (TFII-1) [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR54"">54</xref>], nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-kappaB) [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR55"">55</xref>], and the enkephalin transcription factor-1 (ENKF-1) [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR56"">56</xref>], all of which have been described to activate expression. Thus, the novel TF binding properties created by deletion of C-841 may also be associated with an increase in a-syn expression. Interestingly, CRISPR/Cas9-mediated editing of the CpG1 site (T-886G) created a new CpG site and thereby increasing the potential for further DNA methylation. Substitution of T to G at position -886 (near CpG1) increased overall methylation of <italic toggle=""yes"">SNCA</italic><sub>(-926/-483)</sub> (Supplementary Fig. S<xref rid=""MOESM1"" ref-type=""media"">3</xref>B). Rube et al. suggested that MeCP2’s association with methylation is in part due to its affinity to GC-rich chromatin [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR25"">25</xref>]. Together with increased methylation of subsequent CpGs 3-7, this resulted in enhanced binding of MeCP2 at ChIP1. Increased methylation of the CpGs covered by ChIP2 (CpGs 6-13) most likely accounts for the enhanced MeCP2 binding at ChIP2. The observation that a single intronic nucleotide substitution in the human <italic toggle=""yes"">SNCA</italic> gene alters the methylation of neighboring CpGs, binding MeCP2 and subsequent a-syn production might have implications for other DNA variations in intronic regions. The increased binding of MeCP2 and the subsequently reduced a-syn levels corroborate the importance of <italic toggle=""yes"">SNCA</italic> intron 1 for transcriptional regulation of <italic toggle=""yes"">SNCA</italic>. In this regard, it is important to note that hypermethylation following <italic toggle=""yes"">in vitro</italic> mutation cannot be detected with microarray-based [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR57"">57</xref>, <xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR58"">58</xref>] or gene-specific approaches [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR59"">59</xref>, <xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR60"">60</xref>] which cannot distinguish between the influence of the analyzed SNPs and other sequence differences in linkage disequilibrium with these SNPs. While other polymorphisms outside of <italic toggle=""yes"">SNCA</italic> and associated with PD have also been shown to be significantly associated with both methylation and expression changes [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR61"">61</xref>], methylation studies have yet to examine SNPs associated with PD and located within the <italic toggle=""yes"">SNCA</italic><sub>(-926/-483)</sub> region (upstream of CpG1, between CpG9 and 10 and at CpG19, respectively: rs2619361, rs1372520 and rs3756063). The role of MeCP2 in <italic toggle=""yes"">SNCA</italic> expression regulation was additionally demonstrated by knocking out <italic toggle=""yes"">MeCP2</italic>. Lack of MeCP2 resulted in increased a-syn protein expression which could be reversed by recombinant expression of MeCP2. Loss-of-function mutations of <italic toggle=""yes"">MeCP2</italic> are associated with RTT in females and with syndromic and non-syndromic forms of mental retardation in males [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR31"">31</xref>]. Restoration of <italic toggle=""yes"">MeCP2</italic> knockout cells with mutated MeCP2 had different effects. MeCP2-T158M and MeCP2-R255X, which are among the most common mutations in RTT, acted similar to wild-type MECP2 protein. However, expression of MeCP2-A140D and MeCP2-R270X resulted in increased a-syn expression. Reduced binding of these variants to CpG1 was detected by EMSA pointing to the importance of MeCP2 binding to CpG1 for a-syn expression. MeCP2-A140D and MeCP2-R270X are among the mutations in RTT syndrome with parkinsonian symptoms [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR30"">30</xref>]. Resembling PD in the adult, parkinsonian features in RTT appear as late features during progression of RTT—suggesting that a minor increase of a-syn over time is sufficient to trigger the typical symptoms during aging. Although numerous mouse models with various <italic toggle=""yes"">Mecp2</italic> mutations (i.e. A140V, T158M and R255X) have been established [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR62"">62</xref>], none of the models has revealed an increase in a-syn expression. This is likely due to the distinct differences of the sequences in the intron 1 region of <italic toggle=""yes"">SNCA</italic> between humans and mice. CpG1 and CpG2 in particular are not conserved in the mouse sequence, and <italic toggle=""yes"">Mecp2</italic>-related regulation of a-syn expression in mice may thus differ from humans. Unfortunately, when genes regulated by MeCP2 were analyzed in five RTT-derived induced pluripotent stem cell lines, only the T158M mutation, which in our hands showed no difference to wild type with regard to <italic toggle=""yes"">SNCA</italic> expression, was included and showed no change, too [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR63"">63</xref>]. We identified the methylation of <italic toggle=""yes"">SNCA</italic> intron 1 as an important factor for binding of MeCP2 and the regulation of a-syn expression. The finding that a single nucleotide substitution next to the CpG1 site in the human <italic toggle=""yes"">SNCA</italic> gene altered adjacent CpG methylation, binding of MeCP2 and a-syn production could be of importance for other PD-related polymorphisms. The observation that a single intronic nucleotide substitution in the human <italic toggle=""yes"">SNCA</italic> gene alters the methylation of neighboring CpGs, binding MeCP2 and subsequent a-syn production might have implications for other DNA variations in intronic regions. Altered DNA binding properties of specific MeCP2 variants increased a-syn expression, implicating dysregulated expression of <italic toggle=""yes"">SNCA</italic> in the pathology of these RTT genotypes.

Clinical Features and Disease Progression in Older Individuals with Rett Syndrome,"Although long-term survival in Rett syndrome (RTT) has been observed, limited information on older people with RTT exists. We hypothesized that increased longevity in RTT would be associated with genetic variants in <italic toggle=""yes"">MECP2</italic> associated with milder severity, and that clinical features would not be static in older individuals. To address these hypotheses, we compared the distribution of <italic toggle=""yes"">MECP2</italic> variants and clinical severity between younger individuals with Classic RTT (under 30 years old) and older individuals (over 30 years old). Contrary to expectation, enrichment of a severe <italic toggle=""yes"">MECP2</italic> variant (R106W) was observed in the older cohort. Overall severity was not different between the cohorts, but specific clinical features varied between the cohorts. Overall severity from first to last visit increased in the younger cohort but not in the older cohort. While some specific clinical features in the older cohort were stable from the first to the last visit, others showed improvement or worsening. These data do not support the hypothesis that mild <italic toggle=""yes"">MECP2</italic> variants or less overall severity leads to increased longevity in RTT but demonstrate that clinical features change with increasing age in adults with RTT. Additional work is needed to understand disease progression in adults with RTT.","Rett syndrome (RTT) [<xref rid=""B1-genes-15-01107"" ref-type=""bibr"">1</xref>,<xref rid=""B2-genes-15-01107"" ref-type=""bibr"">2</xref>] is a significantly disabling neurodevelopmental disorder primarily, but not exclusively, affecting girls and women, that is caused in the majority of cases (>96%) by pathogenic loss of function genetic variants in the X-linked gene <italic toggle=""yes"">methyl-CpG-binding protein 2</italic> (<italic toggle=""yes"">MECP2</italic>) gene [<xref rid=""B3-genes-15-01107"" ref-type=""bibr"">3</xref>,<xref rid=""B4-genes-15-01107"" ref-type=""bibr"">4</xref>,<xref rid=""B5-genes-15-01107"" ref-type=""bibr"">5</xref>]. Over the past twenty years, it has been recognized that long-term survival of people with RTT is both possible and likely [<xref rid=""B6-genes-15-01107"" ref-type=""bibr"">6</xref>,<xref rid=""B7-genes-15-01107"" ref-type=""bibr"">7</xref>]. Data obtained from a North American database demonstrated that median survival of people with RTT is greater than 50 years of age [<xref rid=""B8-genes-15-01107"" ref-type=""bibr"">8</xref>]. This finding stands in marked contrast to the observed survival of the cohort of people with RTT originally identified by Andreas Rett beginning in the 1950s [<xref rid=""B9-genes-15-01107"" ref-type=""bibr"">9</xref>]. The observed improvement in survival might relate to factors such as earlier recognition, better management of nutritional concerns, improved physical, occupational, and communication therapies, and better approaches to the associated problems of seizures, gastrointestinal issues, and scoliosis [<xref rid=""B10-genes-15-01107"" ref-type=""bibr"">10</xref>,<xref rid=""B11-genes-15-01107"" ref-type=""bibr"">11</xref>,<xref rid=""B12-genes-15-01107"" ref-type=""bibr"">12</xref>,<xref rid=""B13-genes-15-01107"" ref-type=""bibr"">13</xref>,<xref rid=""B14-genes-15-01107"" ref-type=""bibr"">14</xref>,<xref rid=""B15-genes-15-01107"" ref-type=""bibr"">15</xref>,<xref rid=""B16-genes-15-01107"" ref-type=""bibr"">16</xref>,<xref rid=""B17-genes-15-01107"" ref-type=""bibr"">17</xref>,<xref rid=""B18-genes-15-01107"" ref-type=""bibr"">18</xref>,<xref rid=""B19-genes-15-01107"" ref-type=""bibr"">19</xref>,<xref rid=""B20-genes-15-01107"" ref-type=""bibr"">20</xref>,<xref rid=""B21-genes-15-01107"" ref-type=""bibr"">21</xref>,<xref rid=""B22-genes-15-01107"" ref-type=""bibr"">22</xref>]. Although it has been recognized that many individuals with RTT survive into adulthood, limited work has evaluated the clinical features of mature women with this disorder. Lotan et al. [<xref rid=""B23-genes-15-01107"" ref-type=""bibr"">23</xref>] reported three women greater than thirty years old in Israel whereas Peron et al. [<xref rid=""B24-genes-15-01107"" ref-type=""bibr"">24</xref>] described fifty-six women with RTT ranging in age between 19–49 in Italy. However, the median age of this latter group was 29 years yielding not more than 28 women 30 years of age or greater. Gross motor skills were evaluated in 24 individuals in Denmark, age 30–66 [<xref rid=""B25-genes-15-01107"" ref-type=""bibr"">25</xref>], and medical issues and epilepsy in smaller numbers in Norway [<xref rid=""B26-genes-15-01107"" ref-type=""bibr"">26</xref>,<xref rid=""B27-genes-15-01107"" ref-type=""bibr"">27</xref>]. Because there is a well-established genotype–phenotype relationship in RTT [<xref rid=""B28-genes-15-01107"" ref-type=""bibr"">28</xref>], the hypothesis has been proposed that individuals with <italic toggle=""yes"">MECP2</italic> variants associated with overall milder involvement, (R133C, R294X, R306C, and C-terminal truncations) would demonstrate greater overall survival [<xref rid=""B28-genes-15-01107"" ref-type=""bibr"">28</xref>]. The corollary to this is that individuals with more severe variants (R106W, R168X, R255X, R270X and large deletions) would be more likely to succumb earlier such that the percentage of those with mild vs. severe mutations would change with increasing age. Among the milder variants, greater maintenance of ambulation and purposeful hand function and lesser difficulties with seizures and scoliosis had been noted previously across the age spectrum [<xref rid=""B28-genes-15-01107"" ref-type=""bibr"">28</xref>]. Although previous work evaluating the association between longevity and <italic toggle=""yes"">MECP2</italic> variants did not identify such an association [<xref rid=""B29-genes-15-01107"" ref-type=""bibr"">29</xref>], the increased survival observed in the US Rett syndrome and RTT-related Disorders Natural History Study (RNHS), comprising sixteen years of longitudinal data from over 1200 people with RTT, prompted a further evaluation of this hypothesis. Additionally, we sought to evaluate whether clinical features were stable or continued to change in older individuals with RTT.   Prolonged survival of individuals with RTT has been known for more than fifteen years [<xref rid=""B8-genes-15-01107"" ref-type=""bibr"">8</xref>], but the specific features of those surviving past thirty years has received scant attention. The RNHS evaluated more than 1600 girls and women with RTT over the past 16 years and among this group we analyzed 1253 with classic RTT; 1143 were under 30 yo at the last visit (mean age 13.9 yo), while 110 were ≥30 yo at their last visit (mean age 39.4 yo). The presumption was that maintenance of ambulation and purposeful hand function and lesser difficulties with seizures and scoliosis associated with specific point mutations (R133C, R294X, R306C and CTT) would influence the likelihood of longevity preferentially. Contrary to our expectation, we did not see a notable difference in the distribution of specific point mutations between the younger and older cohorts, arguing against increased survival specifically in individuals with mild mutations. In other words, older age people with RTT were not dominated by mild <italic toggle=""yes"">MECP2</italic> mutations or overall decreased severity. Additionally, no difference in overall severity was noted between these two groups. However, an ongoing progression of clinical features with worsening functional skills loss and motor features but improvement in nonverbal communication with age was observed. Overall, this indicates a further need to improve our understanding of age-related progression in RTT. Other factors must underlie the inability to support our initial hypotheses. Improved nutrition, better management of epilepsy, pulmonary, and gastrointestinal issues, consistent physical, occupational, and communication therapies, and better attention to orthopedic issues such as scoliosis and joint deformities all promote better health and could be a reason for improved longevity in all variant groups. Further, overall increase in experience of child neurologists, geneticists, and primary care physicians with RTT has advanced the care of these issues during the past twenty or more years. The improvement in care in these domains could be the explanation for prolongation of survival and are areas for further research in the future. Environmental conditions could also be important factors affecting longevity. Most individuals with RTT in the US are cared for in their own homes where enrichment is more likely. Nevertheless, once individuals with developmental issues such as RTT age out of school-based programs, typically at age 22 years, their ability to access programs that increase socialization and provide quality therapeutic programs becomes increasingly more difficult. Differences in access to these programs represent another possible reason for better survival. Indeed, animal studies have shown that clear differences in outcome are related to the quality and quantity of environmental factors including environmental enrichment and socialization [<xref rid=""B33-genes-15-01107"" ref-type=""bibr"">33</xref>,<xref rid=""B34-genes-15-01107"" ref-type=""bibr"">34</xref>,<xref rid=""B35-genes-15-01107"" ref-type=""bibr"">35</xref>]. Although evidence on the role of other genetic factors is lacking, these could be at play as well. While it had been thought that clinical features are stable after 30 yo in RTT, progressive worsening of functional skills such as hand use, ambulation, and speech, and worsening of features such as chewing, feeding, dystonia, dyskinesia, and decreased sustained interest may occur. However, this is accompanied by stability in many clinical domains such as epilepsy and improvements in nonverbal skills. It is important for clinicians and caregivers to recognize the progression of these clinical features with age. Awareness of this important aspect is vital for discussions with families both at the time of diagnosis when young, but also during transition of care from pediatricians and pediatric subspecialists to their adult counterparts. Knowing that these RTT women can live long lives means our communities need to keep focused on providing high-quality medical and allied health needs and ensuring enrichment programs remain accessible throughout their lives. Importantly, as therapies become available, caregivers and providers should ensure these individuals have access to any new therapeutic modalities. Indeed, the recent approval of trofinetide (Daybue) offers a specific oral therapy for individuals with RTT [<xref rid=""B36-genes-15-01107"" ref-type=""bibr"">36</xref>,<xref rid=""B37-genes-15-01107"" ref-type=""bibr"">37</xref>]. Other agents are currently under study and two gene therapy programs (Taysha Gene Therapies-NCT05606614 and Neurogene-NCT05898620) have now begun. Limitations to this study are noted. While representing the largest older cohort to date, the overall number of people evaluated in the older cohort is still relatively small and there remains a need for further characterization of the longitudinal progression with age in RTT. Additionally, there may be an ascertainment bias for people who have RTT and are ≥30 yo, because the disease was not recognized as a unique disorder until after the publication by Hagberg et al. in 1983 [<xref rid=""B2-genes-15-01107"" ref-type=""bibr"">2</xref>], and widespread awareness of the disorder only emerged after the discovery of its genetic basis in 1999 [<xref rid=""B3-genes-15-01107"" ref-type=""bibr"">3</xref>]. Thus, the majority of people who currently are identified with the diagnosis are under 30 years old. This issue is further compounded by the fact that the awareness of RTT is mainly concentrated in pediatric providers, with adult providers having limited knowledge of RTT and therefore less likely to make the diagnosis of RTT in older individuals. Additionally, the people with RTT ≥30 yo who were evaluated in this study may not reflect the entire spectrum of the affected population in this age range, as they may have multiple other factors that allowed participation in this study, such as higher family socio-economic status, living near a tertiary academic center with access to diagnostic and research opportunities and overall better health. Our ability to capture all individuals with RTT in future “real-world” clinical studies will permit better evaluation of these factors. Finally, a noted limitation of this study is that it only includes information obtained from people living in a high-resource country with access to advanced medical care. As RTT is caused by spontaneous, de novo genetic variants in RTT, it occurs with equal frequency across ethnic populations and geographical areas. However, differences in access to medical care and awareness of the disorder in under resourced countries limit our knowledge of the disorder in these countries and the ability to generalize the results presented here to those regions.",N/A,22 8 2024
Burden of illness in Rett syndrome: initial evaluation of a disorder-specific caregiver survey,,"Rett Syndrome (RTT; OMIM 312750) is a rare X-linked neurodevelopmental disorder that occurs predominantly in girls and women with an incidence of approximately 1 in 10,000 female births worldwide [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR1"">1</xref>, <xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR2"">2</xref>]. Most individuals with RTT (> 96%) carry a pathogenic variant in the methyl-CpG-binding protein 2 (<italic toggle=""yes"">MECP2</italic>) gene, which encodes the transcriptional regulator MeCP2 [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR3"">3</xref>, <xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR4"">4</xref>]. The disorder is characterized by progression of neurologic impairment throughout development into adulthood [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR5"">5</xref>, <xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR6"">6</xref>]. Most individuals with RTT appear to develop normally until around 6–18 months of age, after which they experience a period of regression characterized by loss of spoken language and fine motor skills. This regression, in conjunction with impairment in ambulation and development of hand stereotypic movements, constitute the core diagnostic features of the disorder [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR5"">5</xref>]. Recovery of language and fine motor skills is limited as is the further development of gross motor skills [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR5"">5</xref>, <xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR6"">6</xref>]. In addition to these impairments, other neurologic and systemic manifestations frequently develop [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR7"">7</xref>]; these include seizures [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR8"">8</xref>], sleep problems [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR9"">9</xref>], breathing abnormalities [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR10"">10</xref>], aberrant behaviors [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR11"">11</xref>], musculoskeletal abnormalities (e.g., scoliosis) [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR12"">12</xref>, <xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR13"">13</xref>], and gastrointestinal dysfunction [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR14"">14</xref>]. Although the clinical manifestations of RTT reach relative stability after childhood, further decline in multiple functions may become evident at older ages. Adulthood is a period characterized by limited motor (e.g., emergence of Parkinsonian features) and communication abilities, as well as for the development of internalizing behavioral abnormalities (e.g., depression-like symptoms) [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR11"">11</xref>, <xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR15"">15</xref>–<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR17"">17</xref>]. Thanks to advances in medical and allied health care, including better recognition of factors affecting morbidity and mortality, many individuals with RTT survive into their 50 s [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR18"">18</xref>–<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR20"">20</xref>]. However, ongoing functional deficits and comorbidities experienced may pose significant physical, psychological, social and financial burden on affected individuals and their caregivers. Several studies examining the impact of RTT identified challenges to quality of life of affected individuals [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR21"">21</xref>–<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR23"">23</xref>], their siblings [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR24"">24</xref>, <xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR25"">25</xref>], and their caregivers [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR25"">25</xref>–<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR31"">31</xref>]. These investigations have identified multiple factors affecting outcomes and quality of life in RTT. For affected individuals, these include ability to communicate and ambulate, feeding skills, age of onset of hand stereotypies, severity of seizures, sleep problems and behavioral abnormalities [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR21"">21</xref>–<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR23"">23</xref>, <xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR32"">32</xref>–<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR36"">36</xref>]. The impact on the caregiver’s physical and mental well-being is dependent on, among others, the severity of the child’s physical and behavioral impairments, in particular feeding difficulties; caregiver age and demands; financial challenges; and challenges to family functioning [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR25"">25</xref>–<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR28"">28</xref>, <xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR31"">31</xref>]. Findings on maternal mental health suggest an increased risk of anxiety but they are not conclusive about depression [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR25"">25</xref>–<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR27"">27</xref>]. Of interest is the observation that caregiver mental health is more affected than physical quality of life, and that this profile does not change over a 5-year period [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR28"">28</xref>]. A small study on siblings of girls and women with RTT showed relatively good psychological adjustment, in comparison with population norms [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR24"">24</xref>], while another larger investigation, contrasting the impact with that on siblings of children with Down syndrome, found both benefits and disadvantages for the RTT group [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR24"">24</xref>, <xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR25"">25</xref>]. Despite this increasing literature, many questions remain about the burden of RTT on affected individuals and their families. Previous studies have applied standardized instruments (e.g., Child Health Questionnaire 50) which are not validated for evaluating a population like RTT, with severe communication, motor impairments and other unique clinical features (e.g., “Rett episodes”). Moreover, many surveys have been implemented with relatively small caregiver samples that may not have captured the population-level variability of the disorder and familial experience. Recently, domains of quality of life important for children [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR37"">37</xref>] and adults with RTT have been explored [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR38"">38</xref>]. Accordingly, new instruments and analytical strategies are being developed to investigate the impact of RTT on individuals [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR37"">37</xref>, <xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR39"">39</xref>] and their caregivers [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR40"">40</xref>]. One of these initiatives, reported in the present study, was to implement a comprehensive, large-scale, international study to investigate RTT specific issues. To accomplish these goals, RTT stakeholders representing affected families, clinicians, researchers, and drug developers, in the USA, Europe, and Australia, joined efforts in a “Burden of Illness” project. Here, we report initial results from the caregiver survey on BOI in females with RTT to identify (1) problems (core features, functional impairments, comorbidities) of greater frequency and impact, (2) relationships between severity of a problem, as assessed by caregivers, and its impact on individuals and caregivers, (3) agreement between impact on affected individual and impact on caregiver, and (4) roles of age, clinical type, and country of residence on BOI in RTT.   Rett syndrome (RTT) is a severe neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by a wide and variable range of neurologic impairments and comorbidities, the severity of which can accumulate over time. This study presents an initial overview of BOI in girls and women with RTT. Through an international collaboration of multiple stakeholders, which developed and implemented a caregiver survey targeting 22 RTT-characteristic problems across a large international sample, we were able to identify the most impactful problems, their differential effect on affected individuals and caregivers, and their relationship with clinical severity as estimated by caregivers. We found that among the most frequent, severe and impactful problems were those related to the core features of RTT and related impairments, namely hand function, hand stereotypies, communication and motor impairments, and self-care. We also demonstrated that many problems, particularly those that are episodic in nature (e.g., sleep difficulties, seizures, pain, and behavioral abnormalities), have disproportionately greater impact than severity, affecting caregivers more than individuals with RTT. In the main, these profiles of BOI were not influenced by the affected individuals’ age, clinical type, or country of residence. Previous studies on quality of life of individuals with RTT and their caregivers have identified multiple factors affecting outcomes. Ability to ambulate, feeding skills, severity of seizures, sleep problems and behavioral abnormalities have impact on quality of life of individuals with RTT [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR21"">21</xref>–<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR23"">23</xref>]. Greater severity of child’s impairments, caregiver age and demands, and family function and financial challenges also play a role in caregivers’ physical and mental well-being [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR25"">25</xref>–<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR29"">29</xref>, <xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR31"">31</xref>]. While these data are extremely valuable, to our knowledge, no study has examined the differential impacts of features characteristic to RTT on affected individuals and their caregivers or the relationship between problem severity and quality of life. Furthermore, the considerable phenotypical variability of RTT [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR5"">5</xref>, <xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR46"">46</xref>, <xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR47"">47</xref>] makes analysis of large subject samples, as the one employed in this study, imperative in order to obtain representative and reproducible findings. Problems related to the core diagnostic features of RTT [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR5"">5</xref>], involving communication, fine motor, and gross motor function, as well as self-care, were among the most frequent, severe and impactful manifestations. Our analyses demonstrated an expected interdependence between severity and impact scores, due to the fact that all scoring was conducted by caregivers who were assessing the affected children and themselves. Nonetheless, there was significantly greater impact than severity on both core features (i.e., hand stereotypies, nonverbal self-expression) and common symptoms of mild to moderate severity (e.g., gastroesophageal reflux, sleep difficulties, behavioral abnormalities). This was a novel finding that emphasizes that clinical severity, as estimated by caregivers, may underestimate BOI. Verbal self-expression and self-care seemed to be less impactful than severe, although their overall level of impact and severity were high. Other distinctive RTT manifestations that were particularly impactful on caregivers included seizures, Rett episodes, and pain. As with sleep difficulties and behavioral abnormalities, they were characterized by relatively lower frequency or severity than other problems but also by an episodic nature. Despite this, in evaluations covering only the previous month, caregivers reported they were markedly affected by the occurrence of these problems. Whether their unpredictability contributes to their marked impact is unknown; however, these results agree with informal clinic observations. Our findings also highlight the importance of relatively recently investigated problems in RTT, such as sleep and non-autistic behavioral difficulties [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR9"">9</xref>, <xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR11"">11</xref>, <xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR48"">48</xref>–<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR51"">51</xref>]. They are also in line with studies of individuals with other neurodevelopmental disorders which show that sleep difficulties in children can exacerbate parents’ existing strain and fatigue, adversely affecting their mental health and parenting [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR30"">30</xref>, <xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR52"">52</xref>, <xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR53"">53</xref>]. The BOI profiles reported here are also in agreement with a recent investigation on top caregiver concerns in RTT, which reported communication, seizures, walking/balance issues, lack of hand use, and constipation as top concerns for caregivers of individuals with classic RTT [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR54"">54</xref>]. Comparisons of impact on individuals and caregivers demonstrated that the latter appear to be more affected by many of the RTT-characteristic problems evaluated in this project. Caregiver’s role in providing daily care, sometimes representing all essential needs of daily living, can be affected by seemingly milder impairments that add emotional, and physical burden and limit time availability for other activities [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR21"">21</xref>, <xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR30"">30</xref>, <xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR40"">40</xref>]. Our findings are in correspondence to previous studies on morbidity and mortality [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR19"">19</xref>, <xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR20"">20</xref>] and quality of life of affected individuals and caregivers [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR21"">21</xref>–<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR23"">23</xref>, <xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR25"">25</xref>–<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR28"">28</xref>, <xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR31"">31</xref>, <xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR40"">40</xref>] but insights into the wide range of problems and the relative independence of impact from clinical severity for some problems is novel. Indeed, even RTT-characteristic problems that are mild in severity can place a disproportionate burden on affected individuals and, particularly, on their caregivers. Interestingly, the profiles of severity and impact reported for the total subject sample were to large extent replicated in analyses of age, clinical type, and country of residence groups. For instance, the greater impact of seizures on caregivers of younger than older individuals and those residing in the USA may reflect different levels of tolerance for this unpredictable type of symptom. Despite the large subject sample and multiple countries of origin, our data had limitations. Approximately one third of the submitted entries were determined to be invalid at the initial data quality control phase. This problem is inherent to conducting anonymous online surveys. Among them, assessment of problem severity by caregivers did not follow specific guidelines, there was limited verification of caregivers’ understanding of the survey or of the accuracy of responses about clinical type or genetic variants, and there were structural inconsistencies in the survey (e.g., item severity assessed through 5–7 options). Although analyses included age, clinical type, and country of residence groups, some subgroups were relatively small in size (i.e., adolescents, individuals with atypical RTT, Australian sample), which could prevent the replication of some findings. We acknowledge that we did not have data on specific <italic toggle=""yes"">MECP2</italic> pathogenic variants, which are known to influence clinical severity but whose effects on impact are not yet known. Additionally, this international survey included caregivers from a range of communities with disparate degrees of exposure to families with children impacted by other serious disorders. Thus, their perception of severity will undoubtably be relative to their specific experience. Therefore, the present report should be considered as an initial overview analysis of BOI in RTT. We expect that follow-up studies will address some of the abovementioned issues by expanding the current analyses. For instance, investigating the role of treatments and their outcomes, healthcare resource utilization, and other factors on RTT burden. Additional collected data on impact on caregiver (health, relationships, financial impact) would further delineate groups particularly impacted by the clinical manifestations of RTT. This large-scale study of BOI in RTT demonstrated that the most impactful problems were those related to the core features of the disorder and that even mildly severe clinical manifestations can disproportionately impact affected individuals and their caregivers. Future analyses should explore the influence of other factors such as clinical evolution, treatment outcomes, and access to healthcare services. Similar analyses from the healthcare provider perspective should also expand our understanding of BOI in RTT. ",N/A,13 8 2024
Early differential impact of MeCP2 mutations on functional networks in Rett syndrome patient-derived human cerebral organoids,"Human cerebral organoids derived from induced pluripotent stem cells can recapture early developmental processes and reveal changes involving neurodevelopmental disorders. Mutations in the X-linked methyl-CpG binding protein 2 (MECP2) gene are associated with Rett syndrome, and disease severity varies depending on the location and type of mutation. Here, we focused on neuronal activity in Rett syndrome patient-derived organoids, analyzing two types of MeCP2 mutations – a missense mutation (R306C) and a truncating mutation (V247X) - using calcium imaging with three-photon microscopy. Compared to isogenic controls, we found abnormal neuronal activity in Rett organoids and altered network function based on graph theoretic analyses, with V247X mutations impacting functional responses and connectivity more severely than R306C mutations. These changes paralleled EEG data obtained from patients with comparable mutations. Labeling DLX promoter-driven inhibitory neurons demonstrated differences in activity and functional connectivity of inhibitory and excitatory neurons in the two types of mutation. Transcriptomic analyses revealed HDAC2-associated impairment in R306C organoids and decreased GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor expression in excitatory neurons in V247X organoids. These findings demonstrate mutation-specific mechanisms of vulnerability in Rett syndrome and suggest targeted strategies for their treatment.","Rett syndrome (RTT) is a progressive neurodevelopmental disorder that is primarily caused by mutations in the X-linked gene encoding methyl-CpG binding protein 2 (MeCP2) and that predominantly affects girls<sup><xref rid=""R1"" ref-type=""bibr"">1</xref>,<xref rid=""R2"" ref-type=""bibr"">2</xref></sup>. Symptoms typically appear first between 6–18 months of age, and include the loss of purposeful hand skills, decline of speech and social engagement, motor abnormalities, and cognitive impairments<sup><xref rid=""R3"" ref-type=""bibr"">3</xref></sup>. Disease severity can vary significantly among individuals due to the variation of MeCP2 mutations (which include missense and nonsense/truncating mutations) <sup><xref rid=""R4"" ref-type=""bibr"">4</xref>–<xref rid=""R7"" ref-type=""bibr"">7</xref></sup>, and while 863 unique mutations have been identfied, eight mutations constitute more than 60% of documented cases<sup><xref rid=""R8"" ref-type=""bibr"">8</xref>,<xref rid=""R9"" ref-type=""bibr"">9</xref></sup>. MeCP2 can directly bind DNA selectively through its N-terminal methyl-CpG binding domain (MBD) and recruit other corepressors or coactivators such as Sin3a, HDAC1, HDAC2, or CREB1 through its C-terminal transcriptional repression domain (TRD), resulting in the regulation of a large number of downstream genes <sup><xref rid=""R10"" ref-type=""bibr"">10</xref>,<xref rid=""R11"" ref-type=""bibr"">11</xref></sup>. In the past two decades, studies exploring mutations of the MBD (or using MeCP2 null <italic toggle=""yes"">MeCP2</italic><sup><italic toggle=""yes"">−/−</italic></sup> and <italic toggle=""yes"">Mecp2</italic><sup><italic toggle=""yes"">-/Y</italic></sup> mice) have revealed effects of altered MeCP2 affinity to CpG binding regions and their consequences<sup><xref rid=""R12"" ref-type=""bibr"">12</xref>–<xref rid=""R14"" ref-type=""bibr"">14</xref></sup>. Compared to MeCP2 null and MBD mutations, the impact of the C-terminus is considered to be milder. One such mutation, MeCP2[R306C], in the NCoR-interaction domain (NID) within the TRD, does not affect affinity to the CpG binding domain but abolishes interactions between the NCoR corepressor complex and HDAC3 <sup><xref rid=""R15"" ref-type=""bibr"">15</xref>,<xref rid=""R16"" ref-type=""bibr"">16</xref></sup>. Disease severity has also been linked to mutation type in addition to location in the gene<sup><xref rid=""R5"" ref-type=""bibr"">5</xref></sup>. One of the most common truncating mutations in the MBD, MeCP2[R168X], has been associated with severe symptoms<sup><xref rid=""R17"" ref-type=""bibr"">17</xref></sup>. On the other hand, a frequent missense mutation also in the MBD, MeCP2[T158M], has been associated with lesser disease severity <sup><xref rid=""R18"" ref-type=""bibr"">18</xref>,<xref rid=""R19"" ref-type=""bibr"">19</xref></sup>. Overall, milder disease severity has been described in Rett patients carrying missense mutations, and the effects of the missense R306C mutation in the NID/TRD have been reported as less functionally deleterious compared to nonsense or truncating mutations in the TRD<sup><xref rid=""R20"" ref-type=""bibr"">20</xref></sup>. Understanding the relationship between mutation types of MeCP2 and disease severity is important for understanding molecular mechanisms underlying the pathology of Rett syndrome as well as developing targeted treatment strategies. Cerebral organoids derived from human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSC) have emerged as powerful experimental systems for their ability to recapitulate early human neurodevelopmental processes<sup><xref rid=""R21"" ref-type=""bibr"">21</xref>,<xref rid=""R22"" ref-type=""bibr"">22</xref></sup>. This novel <italic toggle=""yes"">in vitro</italic> approach allows us to expand our current understanding of development which is mostly constructed from studies with human individuals, animal experiments with rodents, and conventional 2D cell cultures <italic toggle=""yes"">in vitro</italic>. Importantly, patient-derived organoids facilitate analyses of pathological mechanisms underlying not only anatomical alterations<sup><xref rid=""R23"" ref-type=""bibr"">23</xref>–<xref rid=""R25"" ref-type=""bibr"">25</xref></sup> but also their neuronal functionality and developmental dynamics<sup><xref rid=""R26"" ref-type=""bibr"">26</xref></sup>. The ability to prepare cerebral organoids from Rett syndrome patients with different mutation types offers the opportunity to directly study the effects of mutations on early developmental events, especially functional networks, and potentially relate disease severity to early occurring misfunction. In this study, we investigated how two different MeCP2 mutations – the 916C>T / R306C missense mutation and 705delG / V247X truncating mutation, both located near each other in the TRD, with R306C in the NID and V247X just outside it - differentially impact the structure and function of developing neuronal networks. We carried out imaging-based quantification of patient-derived cerebral organoids carrying these two mutations and their isogenic controls using three-photon and two-photon microscopy, employing genetically encoded Ca<sup>2+</sup> indicators (GCaMP6f and jRGECO1a) along with label-free third-harmonic generation (THG) imaging and additional labeling techniques to identify specific types of neurons. We analyzed the responses and functional connectivity of neurons, including that of inhibitory/excitatory neurons, in MeCP2 mutant and isogenic control organoids and discovered systematic differences in response features between mutation types. Differences in connection patterns were also revealed by network-based analyses based on graph theory. Interestingly, these differences resembled changes observed in EEG data from human patients with comparable mutations, suggesting early developmental origins of brain-wide connectivity. scRNAseq and bulk RNAseq enabled the characterization of different gene expression patterns in the organoids, reinforcing the hypothesis that distinct molecular pathways were affected by different mutations. Specifically, these analyses indicated that inhibitory-to-excitatory connections (GABA-GABRA2/4 and neurexin-neuroligin complex) were affected in V247X organoids whereas HDAC2 gene expression was altered in R306C organoids. These findings suggested mutation-specific strategies for restoring functional responses, and application of specific agents indeed rescued neuronal activity-based connectivity in the two types of organoid.  In this paper, we describe altered functional connectivity of neurons and transcriptional changes in Rett syndrome patient-derived organoids carrying MeCP2[R306C] and [V247X] mutations. Our findings demonstrate that cerebral organoids can recapture developmental maturation of multiple neuron classes (<xref rid=""F1"" ref-type=""fig"">Figs. 1</xref>, <xref rid=""F5"" ref-type=""fig"">5</xref>) along with their alteration by MeCP2 mutations. The two mutations that we examined, both in the TRD, led to some similar but importantly several different outcomes from morphological (<xref rid=""F1"" ref-type=""fig"">Fig. 1</xref>), functional (<xref rid=""F2"" ref-type=""fig"">Figs. 2</xref>, <xref rid=""F3"" ref-type=""fig"">3</xref>) and transcriptomic (<xref rid=""F5"" ref-type=""fig"">Fig. 5</xref>) perspectives. V247X mutant organoids , but not R306C mutant organoids, were significantly larger and exhibited enhanced proliferation of neural progenitor cells (<xref rid=""F1"" ref-type=""fig"">Fig. 1</xref>), confirming previous reports of V247X organoids showing expanded size and rosettes <sup><xref rid=""R40"" ref-type=""bibr"">40</xref></sup>. We used a Ca<sup>2+</sup> sensor together with three-photon microscopy to show that neurons in both R306C and V247X mutant organoids exhibited lower average spike frequency and reduced synchronicity compared to the isogenic pair, indicating disruptions in synaptic connections (<xref rid=""F2"" ref-type=""fig"">Fig. 2</xref>). These data are consistent with previous reports of altered neuronal activity in RTT organoids <sup><xref rid=""R26"" ref-type=""bibr"">26</xref></sup>. Graph theory-based functional network analyses demonstrated a greater number of connections per neuron in organoids with both RTT mutations (<xref rid=""F3"" ref-type=""fig"">Fig. 3</xref>). These analyses revealed altered functional connectivity and network structures, characterized by changes in the local clustering coefficient and small world propensity (SWP); SWP was highly reduced in R306C organoids compared to controls (<xref rid=""F3"" ref-type=""fig"">Fig. 3</xref>). Network analyses of human functional brain activity data has shown that neurons may be efficiently linked by local and long-range connections to represent robust and globally efficient processing<sup><xref rid=""R27"" ref-type=""bibr"">27</xref></sup>. Our findings demonstrate that even cerebral organoids have small world structure, indicating organized rather than random connectivity, and mutant organoids display disruption of small-world propensity. Additionally, third harmonic generation (THG) imaging allowed us to visualize the laminar structure of organoids alongside Ca<sup>2+</sup> activity, demonstrating that intra-layer functional connectivity of neurons was more abundant than inter-layer connectivity in control organoids. However, this trend weakened in RTT mutant organoids, especially with the V247X mutation (<xref rid=""F4"" ref-type=""fig"">Fig. 4</xref>). Bulk RNAseq and scRNAseq results followed by NeuronChatDB analysis showed altered gene expression of HDAC2 in neurons in R306C organoids and impaired GABA-A receptor expression in excitatory neurons in V247X organoids (<xref rid=""F5"" ref-type=""fig"">Fig. 5</xref>). Treatment with an HDAC2 selective inhibitor and a GABA agonist respectively in the two organoid mutations restored neuronal functionality, including spike frequency and SWPs (<xref rid=""F5"" ref-type=""fig"">Fig. 5N</xref>, <xref rid=""F5"" ref-type=""fig"">O</xref>). HDAC2 is an important transcriptional co-repressor with MECP2, and the R306C mutation has been shown to disrupt the interaction between another class 1 HDAC, HDAC3, and the NCoR interaction domain <sup><xref rid=""R41"" ref-type=""bibr"">41</xref></sup>. This disruption may lead to abnormal HDAC2 gene expression<sup><xref rid=""R42"" ref-type=""bibr"">42</xref></sup>, which has previously been implicated in neurodegeneration and brain aging, such as Alzheimer’s disease <sup><xref rid=""R43"" ref-type=""bibr"">43</xref>–<xref rid=""R45"" ref-type=""bibr"">45</xref></sup>. Restoration of HDAC2 levels has been shown to improve neuronal maturation and reduce amyloid-beta peptide along with restoring mitochondrial dynamics<sup><xref rid=""R46"" ref-type=""bibr"">46</xref></sup>. Although further assessment is necessary, our result suggest that selective restoration of HDAC2 could be one of the strategies for restoring phenotypes in R306C and other Rett syndrome mutations that target similar mechanisms. The V247X mutation causes upregulation of specific miRNAs, especially miR-199 and miR-214, in organoids<sup><xref rid=""R40"" ref-type=""bibr"">40</xref></sup>, by mechanisms that include aberrant BMP4 and SMAD signaling<sup><xref rid=""R9"" ref-type=""bibr"">9</xref></sup>. Local miRNA-dependent translational regulation of GABA-A receptor subunits has been described<sup><xref rid=""R47"" ref-type=""bibr"">47</xref></sup>, and could represent a mechanism by which V247X mutation-dependent miRNAs downregulate GABA-A receptors. By labeling DLX-promoter driven inhibitory neurons with EGFP and using jRGECO1a as a Ca<sup>2+</sup> indicator, along with fast-scan two-photon microscopy, we identified responses of inhibitory (DLX<sup>+</sup>) and putative excitatory (DLX<sup>-</sup>) neurons (<xref rid=""F6"" ref-type=""fig"">Fig. 6</xref>). Excitatory-inhibitory connectivity exhibited reduced strength while excitatory-excitatory connectivity increased in V247X organoids compared to isogenic controls, whereas no significant differences in connectivity were observed in R306C organoids. Additionally, scRNAseq and NeuronChatDB analysis revealed reduction of I to E connection strength via downregulation of <italic toggle=""yes"">GABRA2</italic> and <italic toggle=""yes"">GABRA4</italic> in excitatory neurons and impairment of GABA-GABRA and NRX-NLGN signaling pathways, which may trigger altered network connectivity and small world propensity in V247X organoids. CellChatDB analysis revealed that astrocyte-to-excitatory neuron communication in V247X organoids was significantly deficient. Specific signaling pathways involving <italic toggle=""yes"">NRG3-ERBB4, NRXN3-NLGN1,</italic> and <italic toggle=""yes"">Glu-SLC1A2/3-GLS to GRIAs</italic> were disrupted, which are fundamental for astrocyte-neuron adhesion and glutamate regulation at the synapse<sup><xref rid=""R39"" ref-type=""bibr"">39</xref>,<xref rid=""R48"" ref-type=""bibr"">48</xref></sup>. These findings add to the evidence that astrocytes have critical and diverse roles in the pathophysiology of Rett Syndrome<sup><xref rid=""R49"" ref-type=""bibr"">49</xref>–<xref rid=""R51"" ref-type=""bibr"">51</xref></sup>, and our findings suggest that the effects may be mutation-specific. Preliminary EEG data from human patients carrying truncating [R255X and R270X] or missense [R306C] mutations in the TRD indicated that SWPs were altered compared to age-matched controls in manner similar to changes observed in organoids with truncating (V247X) or missense (R306C) mutations in the TRD, suggesting that large-scale connectivity changes in Rett syndrome patients may originate in early development (<xref rid=""SD1"" ref-type=""supplementary-material"">Fig. S4</xref> and <xref rid=""SD1"" ref-type=""supplementary-material"">S5</xref>). SWP derived from fMRI measurements is also disrupted in schizophrenia patients <sup><xref rid=""R52"" ref-type=""bibr"">52</xref></sup>. Further investigation is essential to understand how changes in E-I balance associated with altered synaptic connectivity in MeCP2 mutations contribute to altered local and long-range networks in cerebral organoids and human subjects. Our utilization of a cerebral organoid model, combined with multiphoton imaging using Ca<sup>2+</sup> tracers and cell-specific labeling and transcriptomic analyses, demonstrates a valuable tool for studying the early development of neuronal activity and networks in neurodevelopmental disorders. These findings hold promise for understanding mutation-specific mechanisms of Rett syndrome, and developing targeted mutation-specific therapeutics  ",N/A,10 8 2024
"Altered activity of mPFC pyramidal neurons and parvalbumin-expressing interneurons during social interactions in a <italic toggle=""yes"">Mecp2</italic> mouse model for Rett syndrome","Social memory impairments in <italic toggle=""yes"">Mecp2</italic> knockout (KO) mice result from altered neuronal activity in the monosynaptic projection from the ventral hippocampus (vHIP) to the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC). The hippocampal network is hyperactive in this model for Rett syndrome, and such atypically heightened neuronal activity propagates to the mPFC through this monosynaptic projection, resulting in altered mPFC network activity and social memory deficits. However, the underlying mechanism of cellular dysfunction within this projection between vHIP pyramidal neurons (PYR) and mPFC PYRs and parvalbumin interneurons (PV-IN) resulting in social memory impairments in <italic toggle=""yes"">Mecp2</italic> KO mice has yet to be elucidated. We confirmed <italic toggle=""yes"">social memory</italic> (but not <italic toggle=""yes"">sociability</italic>) deficits in <italic toggle=""yes"">Mecp2</italic> KO mice using a new 4-chamber social memory arena, designed to minimize the impact of the tethering to optical fibers required for simultaneous <italic toggle=""yes"">in vivo</italic> fiber photometry of Ca<sup>2+</sup>-sensor signals during social interactions. mPFC PYRs of wildtype (WT) mice showed increases in Ca<sup>2+</sup> signal amplitude during explorations of a novel toy mouse and interactions with both familiar and novel mice, while PYRs of <italic toggle=""yes"">Mecp2</italic> KO mice showed smaller Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals during interactions only with live mice. On the other hand, mPFC PV-INs of <italic toggle=""yes"">Mecp2</italic> KO mice showed larger Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals during interactions with a familiar cage-mate compared to those signals in PYRs, a difference absent in the WT mice. These observations suggest atypically heightened inhibition and impaired excitation in the mPFC network of <italic toggle=""yes"">Mecp2</italic> KO mice during social interactions, potentially driving their deficit in social memory.","Atypical social behaviors are characteristic of many neuropsychiatric disorders, including schizophrenia and neurodevelopmental disorders with autistic features (<xref rid=""R7"" ref-type=""bibr"">Brumback et al., 2018</xref>; <xref rid=""R25"" ref-type=""bibr"">Horiai et al., 2020</xref>; <xref rid=""R47"" ref-type=""bibr"">O’Tuathaigh et al., 2007</xref>; <xref rid=""R51"" ref-type=""bibr"">Piskorowski et al., 2016</xref>; <xref rid=""R59"" ref-type=""bibr"">Tao et al., 2022</xref>). Various brain regions have been associated with social behaviors (<xref rid=""R5"" ref-type=""bibr"">Bicks et al., 2020</xref>; <xref rid=""R11"" ref-type=""bibr"">Chen and Hong, 2018</xref>; <xref rid=""R21"" ref-type=""bibr"">Gunaydin et al., 2014</xref>; <xref rid=""R29"" ref-type=""bibr"">Ko, 2017</xref>; <xref rid=""R44"" ref-type=""bibr"">Montagrin et al., 2018</xref>), including the preference to interact with novel conspecifics over inanimate objects (i.e. sociability, social preference) and the memory of those conspecifics (i.e. social memory) (<xref rid=""R13"" ref-type=""bibr"">Chiang et al., 2018</xref>; <xref rid=""R48"" ref-type=""bibr"">Okuyama, 2018</xref>). However, the specific neuronal subtypes involved and their modulation remain to be fully uncovered. The hippocampus is well-known for its role in various types of memory (<xref rid=""R4"" ref-type=""bibr"">Benoy et al., 2018</xref>), including social memory. Pyramidal neurons (PYR) in area CA2 of the dorsal hippocampus (dHIP) and their projections to area CA1 of the ventral hippocampus (vHIP) are necessary for social memory (<xref rid=""R24"" ref-type=""bibr"">Hitti and Siegelbaum, 2014</xref>; <xref rid=""R43"" ref-type=""bibr"">Meira et al., 2018</xref>), while ventral CA3 PYRs are also implicated in social memory (<xref rid=""R13"" ref-type=""bibr"">Chiang et al., 2018</xref>). In addition to these intra-hippocampal connections, PYRs from ventral CA1 and subiculum that project to the nucleus accumbens (NAc) shell are also necessary for social memory (<xref rid=""R49"" ref-type=""bibr"">Okuyama et al., 2016</xref>). We recently demonstrated that either exciting or inhibiting PYRs in ventral CA1 that project to the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) using chemogenetics impairs social memory, without affecting sociability (<xref rid=""R50"" ref-type=""bibr"">Phillips et al., 2019</xref>). Overall neuronal spiking activity within the mPFC network increases during social approach behaviors (<xref rid=""R33"" ref-type=""bibr"">Lee et al., 2016</xref>), and specific mPFC PYR ensembles that either increase or decrease their spiking activity during social interactions remain stable over repeated testing sessions (<xref rid=""R35"" ref-type=""bibr"">Liang et al., 2018</xref>). Moreover, a proper balance of excitatory and inhibitory synaptic inputs onto mPFC excitatory PYRs is crucial for sociability: selective optogenetic manipulation of either PYRs or their inhibitory inputs from local GABAergic interneurons (INs) results in reversible sociability deficits in mice (<xref rid=""R64"" ref-type=""bibr"">Yizhar et al., 2011</xref>). Likewise, optogenetic stimulation of parvalbumin (PV) expressing INs in the mPFC can partially rescue the social memory deficits caused by optogenetic inhibition of vHIP neurons (<xref rid=""R57"" ref-type=""bibr"">Sun et al., 2020</xref>). Additionally, either optogenetic or chemogenetic stimulation of mPFC PV-INs rapidly triggers social approaches, promoting sociability, as well as rescuing impaired sociability caused by social isolation during adolescence (<xref rid=""R5"" ref-type=""bibr"">Bicks et al., 2020</xref>). These findings suggest a critical role of proper mPFC network activity in sociability and social memory, specifically when modulated by PV-INs. Among monogenetic neurodevelopmental disorders with autistic features, Rett syndrome (RTT) is a debilitating condition that presents with a multitude of neurological and psychiatric signs and symptoms, including motor control deficits, breathing irregularities, anxiety, panic attacks, seizures, autistic features, speech problems, and intellectual disability (<xref rid=""R10"" ref-type=""bibr"">Chahrour and Zoghbi, 2007</xref>; <xref rid=""R22"" ref-type=""bibr"">Haas, 1988</xref>; <xref rid=""R32"" ref-type=""bibr"">Le Bras, 2022</xref>). RTT primarily affects females, occurring in approximately 1 in 10,000 births (<xref rid=""R3"" ref-type=""bibr"">Armstrong, 2005</xref>; <xref rid=""R31"" ref-type=""bibr"">Laurvick et al., 2006</xref>). Initially, individuals with RTT develop typically until 6–18 months of age, when they begin to regress in cognitive skills and language, accompanied by the onset of multiple neuropsychiatric symptoms (<xref rid=""R20"" ref-type=""bibr"">Glaze et al., 2010</xref>; <xref rid=""R23"" ref-type=""bibr"">Hagberg et al., 1983</xref>). The majority of classic RTT cases are caused by mutations in the X-linked gene <italic toggle=""yes"">MECP2</italic> (<xref rid=""R2"" ref-type=""bibr"">Amir et al., 1999</xref>). Methyl-CpG binding protein 2 (MeCP2) is a nuclear protein that binds to methylated DNA, functioning as a transcriptional modulator (<xref rid=""R60"" ref-type=""bibr"">Tillotson and Bird, 2020</xref>). Mice deficient in <italic toggle=""yes"">Mecp2</italic> exhibit multiple neurological phenotypes that are analogous to signs and symptoms observed in RTT individuals (<xref rid=""R12"" ref-type=""bibr"">Chen et al., 2001</xref>). Of relevance to seizure disorders and intellectual disability in RTT individuals, disinhibition of principal excitatory neurons in hippocampal area CA3 causes hippocampal network hyperactivity in <italic toggle=""yes"">Mecp2</italic> knockout (KO) mice (<xref rid=""R8"" ref-type=""bibr"">Calfa et al., 2011</xref>; <xref rid=""R9"" ref-type=""bibr"">Calfa et al., 2015</xref>), which leads to enhanced excitatory synaptic transmission that occludes long-term potentiation at CA3-CA1 synapses (<xref rid=""R34"" ref-type=""bibr"">Li et al., 2016</xref>), likely contributing to the seizure phenotype in mice (<xref rid=""R14"" ref-type=""bibr"">D’Cruz et al., 2010</xref>; <xref rid=""R61"" ref-type=""bibr"">Wither et al., 2018</xref>; <xref rid=""R66"" ref-type=""bibr"">Zhang et al., 2008</xref>) and RTT individuals (<xref rid=""R20"" ref-type=""bibr"">Glaze et al., 2010</xref>). Similarly, brainstem nuclei responsible for breathing control also show hyperactivity due to atypically heightened excitatory synaptic transmission (<xref rid=""R18"" ref-type=""bibr"">Dhingra et al., 2013</xref>; <xref rid=""R26"" ref-type=""bibr"">Katz et al., 2009</xref>). Conversely, cortical networks show hypoactivity due to either enhanced inhibition or reduced excitation (<xref rid=""R16"" ref-type=""bibr"">Dani et al., 2005</xref>; <xref rid=""R19"" ref-type=""bibr"">Durand et al., 2012</xref>), including the mPFC (<xref rid=""R50"" ref-type=""bibr"">Phillips et al., 2019</xref>; <xref rid=""R53"" ref-type=""bibr"">Sceniak et al., 2016</xref>). Despite such local hypoactivity in the mPFC, stimulation of afferent inputs from the vHIP evokes larger, longer, and more widespread depolarizations in the mPFC of <italic toggle=""yes"">Mecp2</italic> KO mice, which is accompanied by social memory deficits, without affecting sociability (<xref rid=""R50"" ref-type=""bibr"">Phillips et al., 2019</xref>). Furthermore, chemogenetic inhibition of mPFC-projecting vHIP PYRs for 3 weeks normalized vHIP-driven mPFC activity and improved social memory (<xref rid=""R50"" ref-type=""bibr"">Phillips et al., 2019</xref>), suggesting that heightened hippocampal activity due to CA3 disinhibition spreads to the mPFC via this monosynaptic excitatory long-range projection. These vHIP afferent axons synapse on mPFC PYRs (<xref rid=""R17"" ref-type=""bibr"">Dembrow et al., 2015</xref>; <xref rid=""R36"" ref-type=""bibr"">Little and Carter, 2012</xref>; <xref rid=""R38"" ref-type=""bibr"">Liu and Carter, 2018</xref>; <xref rid=""R50"" ref-type=""bibr"">Phillips et al., 2019</xref>), as well as onto different subclasses of GABAergic INs, including those expressing PV, somatostatin (SOM), calretinin (CR), and cholecystokinin (CCK) (<xref rid=""R38"" ref-type=""bibr"">Liu and Carter, 2018</xref>; <xref rid=""R39"" ref-type=""bibr"">Liu et al., 2020b</xref>; <xref rid=""R41"" ref-type=""bibr"">Marek et al., 2018</xref>; <xref rid=""R50"" ref-type=""bibr"">Phillips et al., 2019</xref>), with the fraction of vHIP axons synapsing onto PV-INs and pyramidal tract PYRs showing the most significant differences between <italic toggle=""yes"">Mecp2</italic> KO mice and their littermate wildtype (WT) controls (<xref rid=""R50"" ref-type=""bibr"">Phillips et al., 2019</xref>). Consistent with the role and engagement of the mPFC during social behaviors (<xref rid=""R33"" ref-type=""bibr"">Lee et al., 2016</xref>; <xref rid=""R35"" ref-type=""bibr"">Liang et al., 2018</xref>; <xref rid=""R64"" ref-type=""bibr"">Yizhar et al., 2011</xref>), <italic toggle=""yes"">Mecp2</italic> KO mice show deficits in social memory that are rescued by chemogenetic inhibition of mPFC-projecting ventral CA1 PYRs (<xref rid=""R50"" ref-type=""bibr"">Phillips et al., 2019</xref>). Here, we used fiber photometry of intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals as surrogates of neuronal spiking activity, and show that mPFC PYRs of WT mice have increased amplitude of activity at the onset of explorations of a toy mouse, and interactions with both familiar and novel mice, while PYRs of <italic toggle=""yes"">Mecp2</italic> KO mice showed smaller Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals only during interactions with live mice. On the other hand, mPFC PV-INs of <italic toggle=""yes"">Mecp2</italic> KO mice showed larger Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals during interactions with a familiar cage-mate compared to those signals in PYRs, a difference absent in WT mice. These observations indicate atypically heightened inhibition from a specific subclass of PYR-targeting GABAergic IN (i.e. PV-INs), as well as impaired excitatory PYR activity in the mPFC of <italic toggle=""yes"">Mecp2</italic> KO mice during social interactions, potentially driving their deficit in social memory. Understanding the dynamic interplay between PYRs and different classes of GABAergic INs in the mPFC that are targets of vHIP inputs during social interactions is crucial for developing rational therapies for RTT and other neurodevelopmental disorders with social memory deficits, including those with autistic features.  The initial validation of our new 4-chamber social arena was done using naive untethered male WT mice (<xref rid=""F1"" ref-type=""fig"">Fig. 1</xref>). All other experiments (<xref rid=""F2"" ref-type=""fig"">Figs. 2</xref>–<xref rid=""F6"" ref-type=""fig"">6</xref>) were performed in <italic toggle=""yes"">Mecp2</italic> KO mice crossed with PV-Cre mice (referred to as <italic toggle=""yes"">Mecp2</italic> KO::PV-Cre) and their WT littermates (referred to as WT::PV-Cre), all of which expressed Ca<sup>2+</sup> sensors in either mPFC PYRs or PV-INs, and had fiber-optic cannulas implanted in the mPFC for fiber photometry of intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> sensors during behavioral tasks in the novel 4-chamber social arena. Here, we report our findings of spiking activity from glutamatergic excitatory pyramidal neurons (PYRs) and parvalbumin (PV)-expressing GABAergic inhibitory interneurons (PV-INs) in the mPFC of mice performing social behaviors in a new 4-chamber arena. We performed single-color photometry of the green-shifted Ca<sup>2+</sup> sensor jGCaMP8 expressed in either PYRs or PV-INs of different mice, as well as dual-color photometry of jGCaMP8m expressed in PYRs and red-shifted jRGECO expressed in PV-INs. We compared the spiking activity of mPFC PYRs and PV-INs in WT::PV-Cre mice during exploration of a toy mouse, a novel mouse, and a familiar cage-mate, to the activity of those neuronal cell types in <italic toggle=""yes"">Mecp2</italic> KO::PV-Cre mice, an experimental model for the monogenic autism disorder Rett syndrome. We first confirmed that our new 4-chamber social assay (modified from <xref rid=""R30"" ref-type=""bibr"">Krueger-Burg et al., 2016</xref>) yields results in untethered WT mice that are similar to those obtained with the classical linear 3-chamber social arena (<xref rid=""R45"" ref-type=""bibr"">Moy et al., 2004</xref>). Using the new 4-chamber social assay, we also confirmed the selective deficit in <italic toggle=""yes"">social memory</italic> of <italic toggle=""yes"">Mecp2</italic> KO mice first described in untethered naive mice using a linear 3-chamber arena (<xref rid=""R50"" ref-type=""bibr"">Phillips et al., 2019</xref>). We recorded spiking activity from mPFC neurons during a social task because of its role in social motivation and recognition in the human and rodent brain (<xref rid=""R28"" ref-type=""bibr"">Kim et al., 2015</xref>). We focused on PYRs and PV-INs in the mPFC due to their established roles in social behaviors and maintaining a proper excitation-inhibition balance at the network level (<xref rid=""R5"" ref-type=""bibr"">Bicks et al., 2020</xref>; <xref rid=""R35"" ref-type=""bibr"">Liang et al., 2018</xref>; <xref rid=""R57"" ref-type=""bibr"">Sun et al., 2020</xref>; <xref rid=""R64"" ref-type=""bibr"">Yizhar et al., 2011</xref>). We found that most mPFC PYRs in WT::PV-Cre mice increase their spiking activity during explorations of a familiar cage-mate mouse and a novel mouse. In contrast, most mPFC PYRs in <italic toggle=""yes"">Mecp2</italic> KO::PV-Cre mice did not change their activity during toy mouse exploration or interactions with a familiar mouse. Furthermore, the temporal spread of their activity during interactions with a novel mouse suggests longer desynchronized spiking epochs compared to the briefer and synchronous patterns of mPFC PYRs in WT::PV-Cre mice. Such atypical spiking pattern may reflect and/or originate from the network hypoactivity of the mPFC in <italic toggle=""yes"">Mecp2</italic> KO::PV-Cre mice, reported to result from either fewer excitatory inputs between PYRs (as in primary somatosensory cortex and mPFC) (<xref rid=""R16"" ref-type=""bibr"">Dani et al., 2005</xref>; <xref rid=""R53"" ref-type=""bibr"">Sceniak et al., 2016</xref>) or more abundant inhibitory inputs onto PYRs, as in primary visual cortex (<xref rid=""R19"" ref-type=""bibr"">Durand et al., 2012</xref>). Supporting this notion, <italic toggle=""yes"">in vivo</italic> Ca<sup>2+</sup> imaging from mPFC PYRs in female <italic toggle=""yes"">Mecp2</italic> heterozygous mice carrying head-mounted miniscopes also revealed a lower spiking frequency during social interactions than in WT mice (<xref rid=""R62"" ref-type=""bibr"">Xu et al., 2022</xref>). mPFC PV-INs in WT::PV-Cre mice increase their spiking activity during the first exposure to a familiar cage-mate mouse during the <italic toggle=""yes"">sociability</italic> phase, but not the second exposure during the <italic toggle=""yes"">social memory</italic> phase and during explorations of a novel mouse. In contrast, mPFC PV-INs in <italic toggle=""yes"">Mecp2</italic> KO::PV-Cre mice increase their activity prior to onset of interactions with a familiar cage-mate mouse. Moreover, the temporal spread of their activity during interactions with a cage-mate mouse suggests longer desynchronized spiking patterns compared to the activity of PV-INs in WT::PV-Cre mice, as well as PYR in <italic toggle=""yes"">Mecp2</italic> KO::PV-Cre mice. In addition, the activity of PV-INs of <italic toggle=""yes"">Mecp2</italic> KO::PV-Cre mice remains unaltered during interactions with a novel mouse, which may result from altered inputs from ventral hippocampal projections known to contribute to social memory (<xref rid=""R50"" ref-type=""bibr"">Phillips et al., 2019</xref>; <xref rid=""R57"" ref-type=""bibr"">Sun et al., 2020</xref>). Excitatory projections from the ventral hippocampus to the mPFC, known to modulate social memory (<xref rid=""R50"" ref-type=""bibr"">Phillips et al., 2019</xref>), may propagate the hyperactivity of the hippocampal network in <italic toggle=""yes"">Mecp2</italic> KO mice (<xref rid=""R8"" ref-type=""bibr"">Calfa et al., 2011</xref>; <xref rid=""R9"" ref-type=""bibr"">Calfa et al., 2015</xref>; <xref rid=""R14"" ref-type=""bibr"">D’Cruz et al., 2010</xref>; <xref rid=""R34"" ref-type=""bibr"">Li et al., 2016</xref>; <xref rid=""R61"" ref-type=""bibr"">Wither et al., 2018</xref>; <xref rid=""R66"" ref-type=""bibr"">Zhang et al., 2008</xref>) to the mPFC microcircuit, further disrupting its network imbalance (<xref rid=""R53"" ref-type=""bibr"">Sceniak et al., 2016</xref>). Indeed, chemogenetic inhibition of mPFC-projecting ventral CA1 PYRs restored social memory preference in <italic toggle=""yes"">Mecp2</italic> KO mice (<xref rid=""R50"" ref-type=""bibr"">Phillips et al., 2019</xref>). Consistently, stimulation of mPFC PV-INs or inhibition of VIP-INs that synapse onto them also restored social memory (<xref rid=""R57"" ref-type=""bibr"">Sun et al., 2020</xref>). On the other hand, inhibition of mPFC PV-INs during a social assay increased PYR activity and improved social discrimination in female <italic toggle=""yes"">Mecp2</italic> heterozygous mice (<xref rid=""R62"" ref-type=""bibr"">Xu et al., 2022</xref>), suggesting that modulation of mPFC inhibition can partially restore proper mPFC function also in female Rett mice, whose brains are a mosaic of MeCP2-expressing and MeCP2-lacking neurons due to random X-chromosome inactivation (<xref rid=""R6"" ref-type=""bibr"">Braunschweig et al., 2004</xref>). Together, these studies support the notion that proper network balance in the mPFC is essential for social memory, and its alteration in Rett mice contributes to their social behavior deficits. In addition to characterizing spiking activity of mPFC PYRs and PV-INs in different mice performing the same social behavior test, we also recorded simultaneously from them in the same mouse by dual-color fiber photometry of Ca<sup>2+</sup> sensors with non-overlapping excitation and emission spectra (<xref rid=""R1"" ref-type=""bibr"">Akerboom et al., 2013</xref>; <xref rid=""R58"" ref-type=""bibr"">Suthard et al., 2024</xref>). These experiments confirmed that mPFC PYRs and PV-INs of WT::PV-Cre mice increase their spiking activity <underline>prior</underline> to both toy exploration and cage-mate interactions in the <italic toggle=""yes"">sociability</italic> phase, while PV-INs increase their activity prior to interactions with a novel mouse in the <italic toggle=""yes"">social memory</italic> phase. In contrast, mPFC PV-INs of <italic toggle=""yes"">Mecp2</italic> KO::PV-Cre mice increase their activity only <underline>during</underline> interactions with a familiar cage-mate, without any changes during toy exploration or interactions with a novel mouse. Similarly, mPFC PYRs of <italic toggle=""yes"">Mecp2</italic> KO::PV-Cre mice lacked changes in activity during toy exploration or interactions with a cage-mate or a novel mouse, further confirming observations from single-color fiber photometry recordings of mPFC PYRs and PV-INs in different mice. A limitation of the approach we followed here is that photometry of ‘bulk’ fluorescence signals from Ca<sup>2+</sup> sensors reports population responses, akin multiunit extracellular recordings, and not all mPFC neurons change their spiking activity during social interactions, with different PYRs that either increase or decrease their activity (<xref rid=""R35"" ref-type=""bibr"">Liang et al., 2018</xref>; <xref rid=""R68"" ref-type=""bibr"">Zhao et al., 2022</xref>). The large difference in the numbers and spatial distribution of PYRs and PV-INs in the mPFC further complicates the interpretation of population Ca<sup>2+</sup> photometry recordings. Another limitation is that the red-shifted jRGECO Ca<sup>2+</sup> sensor is reported to ‘photoswitch’ when illuminated with blue light, which was necessary to excite jGCaMP8 during dual-color photometry recordings (<xref rid=""R1"" ref-type=""bibr"">Akerboom et al., 2013</xref>; <xref rid=""R15"" ref-type=""bibr"">Dana et al., 2016</xref>; <xref rid=""R55"" ref-type=""bibr"">Shaner et al., 2008</xref>; <xref rid=""R56"" ref-type=""bibr"">Shen et al., 2018</xref>). Collectively, we found that the dynamic interplay of PYRs and PV-INs in the mPFC of WT mice is altered in <italic toggle=""yes"">Mecp2</italic> KO, which underscores the critical role of proper mPFC network balance for proper social behaviors.

Using Precision Medicine to Disentangle Genotype–Phenotype Relationships in Twins with Rett Syndrome: A Case Report,"Rett syndrome (RTT) is a paediatric neurodevelopmental disorder spanning four developmental stages. This multi-system disorder offers a unique window to explore genotype–phenotype relationships in a disease model. However, genetic prognosticators of RTT have limited clinical value due to the disorder’s heterogeneity on multiple levels. This case report used a precision medicine approach to better understand the clinical phenotype of RTT twins with an identical pathogenic <italic toggle=""yes"">MECP2</italic> mutation and discordant neurodevelopmental profiles. Targeted genotyping, objective physiological monitoring of heart rate variability (HRV) parameters, and clinical severity were assessed in a RTT twin pair (5 years 7 months old) with an identical pathogenic <italic toggle=""yes"">MECP2</italic> mutation. Longitudinal assessment of autonomic HRV parameters was conducted using the Empatica E4 wristband device, and clinical severity was assessed using the RTT-anchored Clinical Global Impression Scale (RTT-CGI) and the Multi-System Profile of Symptoms Scale (MPSS). Genotype data revealed impaired BDNF function for twin A when compared to twin B. Twin A also had poorer autonomic health than twin B, as indicated by lower autonomic metrics (autonomic inflexibility). Hospitalisation, RTT-CGI-S, and MPSS subscale scores were used as measures of clinical severity, and these were worse in twin A. Treatment using buspirone shifted twin A from an inflexible to a flexible autonomic profile. This was mirrored in the MPSS scores, which showed a reduction in autonomic and cardiac symptoms following buspirone treatment. Our findings showed that a combination of a co-occurring <italic toggle=""yes"">rs6265 BDNF</italic> polymorphism, and worse autonomic and clinical profiles led to a poorer prognosis for twin A compared to twin B. Buspirone was able to shift a rigid autonomic profile to a more flexible one for twin A and thereby prevent cardiac and autonomic symptoms from worsening. The clinical profile for twin A represents a departure from the disorder trajectory typically observed in RTT and underscores the importance of wider genotype profiling and longitudinal objective physiological monitoring alongside measures of clinical symptoms and severity when assessing genotype–phenotype relationships in RTT patients with identical pathogenic mutations. A precision medicine approach that assesses genetic and physiological risk factors can be extended to other neurodevelopmental disorders to monitor risk when genotype–phenotype relationships are not so obvious.","Rett syndrome (RTT), a debilitating paediatric neurodevelopmental disorder, presents with a variety of symptoms spanning across four stages [<xref rid=""B1-cimb-46-00497"" ref-type=""bibr"">1</xref>]. There is no cure for RTT. However, this multi-system disorder offers a unique window of opportunity to explore genotype–phenotype relationships in a disease model. About 90% of reported cases of RTT are due to mutations in the <italic toggle=""yes"">methyl CpG-binding protein 2 gene</italic> (<italic toggle=""yes"">MECP2</italic>), with frameshift and nonsense mutations being the most common [<xref rid=""B2-cimb-46-00497"" ref-type=""bibr"">2</xref>]. While there is some evidence to suggest a genotype–phenotype correlation at the group level [<xref rid=""B3-cimb-46-00497"" ref-type=""bibr"">3</xref>,<xref rid=""B4-cimb-46-00497"" ref-type=""bibr"">4</xref>], RTT can be a clinical diagnosis based on clinical criteria that are independent of molecular profiles [<xref rid=""B5-cimb-46-00497"" ref-type=""bibr"">5</xref>,<xref rid=""B6-cimb-46-00497"" ref-type=""bibr"">6</xref>]. Even though 95% of patients with classic RTT have a pathogenic <italic toggle=""yes"">MECP2</italic> mutation, patients may also present with a pathogenic <italic toggle=""yes"">MECP2</italic> mutation without overt symptoms of RTT [<xref rid=""B7-cimb-46-00497"" ref-type=""bibr"">7</xref>]. In the Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable (FAIR) data set of the 10,968 <italic toggle=""yes"">MECP2</italic> variants examined, 863 were RTT-causing, while 209 were benign variants [<xref rid=""B8-cimb-46-00497"" ref-type=""bibr"">8</xref>]. Reduced levels of MeCP2 can increase the risk of stress-induced mental health disorders in healthy women [<xref rid=""B9-cimb-46-00497"" ref-type=""bibr"">9</xref>]. Additional evidence from a multi-site translational cohort study has also identified <italic toggle=""yes"">MECP2</italic> variants in females with precocious puberty without neurodevelopmental issues [<xref rid=""B10-cimb-46-00497"" ref-type=""bibr"">10</xref>]. The genetic landscape of <italic toggle=""yes"">MECP2</italic> and its associative pathogenicity is complex, with more than 80 genes having been identified to exhibit RTT and RTT-like phenotypes [<xref rid=""B11-cimb-46-00497"" ref-type=""bibr"">11</xref>]. This complexity is further compounded by X chromosome inactivation (XCI), which is suggested to be a driver for the variation in clinical severity in RTT [<xref rid=""B12-cimb-46-00497"" ref-type=""bibr"">12</xref>]. Recent disease modelling of RTT has shown that 3% of the variation in the clinical severity seen in RTT is due to the interplay between paternal XCI and the <italic toggle=""yes"">MECP2</italic> variant [<xref rid=""B13-cimb-46-00497"" ref-type=""bibr"">13</xref>]. When taken together, the evidence strongly suggests that genetic prognosticators in RTT and how they relate to the clinical phenotype should be interpreted carefully [<xref rid=""B14-cimb-46-00497"" ref-type=""bibr"">14</xref>]. Early intervention and holistic management are needed for RTT patients to treat symptoms that are relatively straightforward before they become entrenched, chronic, and severe. Precision medicine considers the individual’s genotype and environment to assist in managing different disorders. This approach may allow for a more accurate prognosis and treatment strategy optimisation focus. In the neurodevelopmental ecosystem, precision medicine has heralded a new era of therapeutics, and a cumulative approach relying on biopsychosocial–ecological, epigenetic, and cellular aspects provides a footing for delivering paediatric precision medicine [<xref rid=""B15-cimb-46-00497"" ref-type=""bibr"">15</xref>]. This framework allows for the implementation of transdiagnostic assessment tools for the longitudinal examination of genetic and physiological risk factors that may extend beyond narrow diagnostic groups [<xref rid=""B16-cimb-46-00497"" ref-type=""bibr"">16</xref>]. Using targeted genotyping and biometric physiological monitoring to examine the propensity of risk allows for a reframing of precision medicine in neurodevelopmental disorders. In the context of RTT, such an approach would be imperative due to the heterogeneity that exists at multiple levels from co-occurring disorders, polypharmacy, and the waxing and waning of symptoms across time as the disorder progresses. Objective physiological monitoring using wearable devices has allowed for examining sleep [<xref rid=""B17-cimb-46-00497"" ref-type=""bibr"">17</xref>] and heart rate variability [<xref rid=""B18-cimb-46-00497"" ref-type=""bibr"">18</xref>,<xref rid=""B19-cimb-46-00497"" ref-type=""bibr"">19</xref>,<xref rid=""B20-cimb-46-00497"" ref-type=""bibr"">20</xref>] in RTT patients. Other approaches have also used thermal imaging of skin temperature [<xref rid=""B21-cimb-46-00497"" ref-type=""bibr"">21</xref>], polysomnographic (PSG) recordings and electrocardiograms [<xref rid=""B22-cimb-46-00497"" ref-type=""bibr"">22</xref>,<xref rid=""B23-cimb-46-00497"" ref-type=""bibr"">23</xref>], and variations between breathing and heart rate [<xref rid=""B24-cimb-46-00497"" ref-type=""bibr"">24</xref>,<xref rid=""B25-cimb-46-00497"" ref-type=""bibr"">25</xref>] during the sleep/wake cycle in RTT patients to study autonomic control. Further, clinical trials are underway, using other RTT biosensors for autonomic symptom tracking [<xref rid=""B26-cimb-46-00497"" ref-type=""bibr"">26</xref>]. While studies on physiological measures can be helpful in developing biomarkers, this approach may be limited if a genetic strategy is not considered. Targeted genotyping combined with objective physiological monitoring may allow for a more robust multimodal approach to study neurodevelopmental disorders, especially when the interplay between genetic mutations and clinical outcomes are not so evident. A multimodal approach may also be better placed to stratify patients with neurodevelopmental disorders according to risk [<xref rid=""B27-cimb-46-00497"" ref-type=""bibr"">27</xref>]. Twin studies can help further understand neurodevelopmental disorders’ aetiology [<xref rid=""B28-cimb-46-00497"" ref-type=""bibr"">28</xref>]. Twin studies are rare in RTT. Previous evidence using videotaped observations from a RTT monozygotic twin has identified neurodevelopment abnormalities before regression [<xref rid=""B29-cimb-46-00497"" ref-type=""bibr"">29</xref>]. Early behavioural interventions may also improve clinical outcomes in twin girls with RTT [<xref rid=""B30-cimb-46-00497"" ref-type=""bibr"">30</xref>]. Another older study described two sisters with identical <italic toggle=""yes"">MECP2</italic> deletions but variable clinical phenotypes [<xref rid=""B31-cimb-46-00497"" ref-type=""bibr"">31</xref>]. While some other twin studies of RTT have been documented [<xref rid=""B29-cimb-46-00497"" ref-type=""bibr"">29</xref>], in the current case report, we assess the discordant clinical phenotype in twins with RTT that have the same pathogenic <italic toggle=""yes"">MECP2</italic> mutation. No study has used paediatric precision medicine that includes targeted genotyping combined with objective longitudinal physiological monitoring of heart rate variability (HRV) parameters to better understand the neurodevelopmental traits across different symptom domains in twins with RTT. The aim of the present case report is to assess whether a precision medicine approach can be used to characterise divergent neurodevelopmental trajectories in twins with RTT, with a view to disentangle the heterogeneity of clinical symptoms and severity.   Our case report used a precision medicine approach to better understand the discordant neurodevelopment phenotypes in twins with RTT having identical pathogenic <italic toggle=""yes"">MECP2</italic> mutations. For the first time, we have demonstrated that a triumvirate of targeted genotyping, longitudinal objective physiological monitoring, and measures of clinical severity in RTT patients can help disentangle clinical outcomes, thereby assisting in clinical risk stratification. We show that twin A has (I) a co-occurring <italic toggle=""yes"">BNDF</italic> mutation, (II) less autonomic flexibility, and (III) poorer clinical outcomes than twin B. These findings are important because they can be extended to other neurodevelopmental disorders to understand clinical outcomes, especially in more clinically vulnerable patients with unclear genotype–phenotype associations. Several outcome measures have been used to assess the clinical severity of RTT. The RTT-CGI has been used in studies of RTT [<xref rid=""B48-cimb-46-00497"" ref-type=""bibr"">48</xref>,<xref rid=""B49-cimb-46-00497"" ref-type=""bibr"">49</xref>,<xref rid=""B50-cimb-46-00497"" ref-type=""bibr"">50</xref>], although some have suggested that the RTT-CGI could be difficult to implement when used more widely, especially when knowledge of RTT is limited [<xref rid=""B51-cimb-46-00497"" ref-type=""bibr"">51</xref>]. In the current case report, the RTT-CGI-S showed that twin A was markedly more impaired than twin B. When honing into the troublesome symptoms, the MPSS revealed that communication, orofacial, autonomic, respiratory, and cardiac problems were more prominent for twin A. Twin A had poor autonomic and cardiac health, as identified by symptom profiling, severity, and HRV parameters. This improved after the initiation of buspirone. The results from the Bayesian inferential methods test also showed that the profile of RTT patients can change over time, with some symptoms improving while others may worsen. Regression is variable in RTT and, hence, the changes following buspirone treatment might not be so obvious. When viewed together, our findings highlight the importance of using an outcome measure to capture symptom change across several clinical domains alongside objective physiological data when assessing clinical severity in RTT and other disorders. Autonomic dysregulation in RTT has been characterised in the literature and is not the focus of the current case report. However, we can further enrich the evidence base by examining a twin with identical <italic toggle=""yes"">MECP2</italic> mutations. In our case report, the measurement of the PNS using RMSSD [<xref rid=""B35-cimb-46-00497"" ref-type=""bibr"">35</xref>,<xref rid=""B36-cimb-46-00497"" ref-type=""bibr"">36</xref>,<xref rid=""B52-cimb-46-00497"" ref-type=""bibr"">52</xref>,<xref rid=""B53-cimb-46-00497"" ref-type=""bibr"">53</xref>] and SNS using SDNN [<xref rid=""B54-cimb-46-00497"" ref-type=""bibr"">54</xref>] demonstrated that twin A had poorer autonomic health than twin B, as indicated by the depressed autonomic metrics. Twin A (pre-buspirone treatment) had autonomic inflexibility and was less likely to adapt to stimuli from demands imposed by the SNS and PNS from concomitant autonomic stressors frequent in RTT, such as pro-arrhythmic (QT prolongation) medications, seizures, infections/sepsis, and medications that cause respiratory depression. Following buspirone treatment, there were statistically significant increases in all HRV parameters for twin A. Patients with RTT are at higher risk of Sudden Unexpected Death in Epilepsy (SUDEP) [<xref rid=""B55-cimb-46-00497"" ref-type=""bibr"">55</xref>], and RMSSD forms part of the SUDEP-7 risk inventory with lower RMSSD scores indicating a risk factor for SUDEP [<xref rid=""B52-cimb-46-00497"" ref-type=""bibr"">52</xref>]. The initiation of buspirone shifted twin A from an inflexible to a more flexible autonomic profile, resulting in a profile more likely to adapt to autonomic stressors. This finding is also mirrored in our MPSS data, which showed a reduction in autonomic and cardiac symptoms following buspirone treatment. When viewed together, although twin A has clinically more RTT severity than twin B, the initiation of buspirone provided a safety net for twin A by preventing the autonomic and cardiac symptoms from becoming worse. When examining the lens of other neurodevelopmental disorders, a meta-analysis has suggested that low HRV and poor vagal control are potential biomarkers in autism spectrum disorder (ASD) [<xref rid=""B56-cimb-46-00497"" ref-type=""bibr"">56</xref>]. It could therefore be surmised that a depressed autonomic imbalance in twin A could be a predictor of poorer neurodevelopmental outcomes, which were in part remedied by buspirone treatment. A recent study suggests autonomic dysregulation during very early infancy could play a key role in the underlying features of ASD symptomatology [<xref rid=""B57-cimb-46-00497"" ref-type=""bibr"">57</xref>] and could add credence to this hypothesis. Buspirone is a partial agonist that has a high affinity for 5-HT<sub>1A</sub> receptors [<xref rid=""B58-cimb-46-00497"" ref-type=""bibr"">58</xref>] and a D2 receptor antagonist [<xref rid=""B59-cimb-46-00497"" ref-type=""bibr"">59</xref>]. It has been used for managing the symptoms seen in neuropsychiatric disorders, spinocerebellar ataxias, and tardive dyskinesia in Parkinson’s disease [<xref rid=""B59-cimb-46-00497"" ref-type=""bibr"">59</xref>]. It may also be helpful for treating behavioural dysregulation following brain injury [<xref rid=""B60-cimb-46-00497"" ref-type=""bibr"">60</xref>], blunting central apnoea’s and improving oxygen saturation in patients with heart failure [<xref rid=""B61-cimb-46-00497"" ref-type=""bibr"">61</xref>], and remission of apneusis in a child with an astrocytoma affecting the respiratory centres of the brain [<xref rid=""B62-cimb-46-00497"" ref-type=""bibr"">62</xref>]. Some previous reports have shown improvements in respiratory dysfunction following buspirone treatment in RTT patients [<xref rid=""B63-cimb-46-00497"" ref-type=""bibr"">63</xref>,<xref rid=""B64-cimb-46-00497"" ref-type=""bibr"">64</xref>,<xref rid=""B65-cimb-46-00497"" ref-type=""bibr"">65</xref>]. Other 5-HT<sub>1A</sub> agonists, such as tandospirone, have also been shown to reduce sleep apnoeic events in an 11-year-old girl with RTT [<xref rid=""B66-cimb-46-00497"" ref-type=""bibr"">66</xref>]. Another study showed mixed improvement following buspirone treatment, compared to topiramate and acetazolamide, for managing irregular breathing in RTT patients [<xref rid=""B67-cimb-46-00497"" ref-type=""bibr"">67</xref>]. Serotonergic (5-hydroxytryptamine, 5-HT) 5-HT<sub>1A</sub> receptors have an important role in anxiety and depression [<xref rid=""B68-cimb-46-00497"" ref-type=""bibr"">68</xref>]. Buspirone augmentation may help in patients with severe depression [<xref rid=""B69-cimb-46-00497"" ref-type=""bibr"">69</xref>]. Indeed, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors such as buspirone have been used for managing anxiety and other behaviour disorders in RTT patients [<xref rid=""B70-cimb-46-00497"" ref-type=""bibr"">70</xref>,<xref rid=""B71-cimb-46-00497"" ref-type=""bibr"">71</xref>]. In RTT, buspirone can also improve the symptoms of Emotional, Behavioural, and Autonomic Dysregulation (EBAD) [<xref rid=""B20-cimb-46-00497"" ref-type=""bibr"">20</xref>]. When viewed together, buspirone seems a promising drug to manage the symptoms of EBAD, such as autonomic dysregulation, breathing problems. or anxiety in RTT. The precise mechanism by which buspirone might improve autonomic flexibility in RTT patients is unknown. The underlying features of EBAD and the associated autonomic dysregulation are complex, and they are therefore unlikely to result from a single unified mechanism. In RTT, evidence points towards a central defect in monoaminergic systems [<xref rid=""B72-cimb-46-00497"" ref-type=""bibr"">72</xref>], and we have suggested previously that defects in serotonergic neurotransmitter systems could be one aspect of better understanding the broad clinical phenotypes in RTT [<xref rid=""B73-cimb-46-00497"" ref-type=""bibr"">73</xref>]. As proposed by others [<xref rid=""B61-cimb-46-00497"" ref-type=""bibr"">61</xref>], acting through pre-synaptic 5-HT<sub>1A</sub> auto-receptors, buspirone modulates the amount of serotonin released from the synaptic cleft. The serotonergic network innervates into the dorsal brainstem, which contains areas critical for cardio-respiratory control, such as the Kölliker–Fuse and solitary tract nuclei [<xref rid=""B72-cimb-46-00497"" ref-type=""bibr"">72</xref>,<xref rid=""B73-cimb-46-00497"" ref-type=""bibr"">73</xref>]. The action of 5-HT on breathing is dependent upon both pre-synaptic and post-synaptic 5-HT neurons associated with respiratory function, and it is suggested that the increase in the firing rate of 5-HT neurons leads to an overall net facilitatory effect on respiration [<xref rid=""B74-cimb-46-00497"" ref-type=""bibr"">74</xref>]. In RTT animal models, 5-HT1A agonists have been shown to reverse the deleterious respiratory phenotype [<xref rid=""B75-cimb-46-00497"" ref-type=""bibr"">75</xref>]. Buspirone might help regulate the altered serotonergic tone in RTT and improve the functioning of 5-HT neuronal networks. This premise might be more critical for RTT patients with co-occurring <italic toggle=""yes"">BDNF</italic> polymorphisms because evidence has shown that BDNF is crucial for the proper functioning of the serotonergic neurotransmitter system [<xref rid=""B76-cimb-46-00497"" ref-type=""bibr"">76</xref>] and is dysregulated in Kölliker–Fuse nuclei in infants with unexplained sudden death [<xref rid=""B77-cimb-46-00497"" ref-type=""bibr"">77</xref>]. We have suggested that BDNF dysregulation disrupts the neuronal firing in critical regions of the brainstem in RTT, which are important for cardiorespiratory autonomic function [<xref rid=""B73-cimb-46-00497"" ref-type=""bibr"">73</xref>]. By strengthening post-synaptic inhibition, the net effect of buspirone in RTT could be used to suppress the activation of respiratory neurons, which in turn would normalise the dysregulated inspiratory and expiratory neurons [<xref rid=""B66-cimb-46-00497"" ref-type=""bibr"">66</xref>] in the brainstem and improve breathing. Buspirone might therefore help to limit the autonomic stress on an already weakened autonomic system, as was seen for twin A, which had a co-occurring <italic toggle=""yes"">rs6265</italic> BDNF polymorphism that is associated with a reduced secretion of BDNF from neurons and impaired BDNF signalling [<xref rid=""B47-cimb-46-00497"" ref-type=""bibr"">47</xref>,<xref rid=""B78-cimb-46-00497"" ref-type=""bibr"">78</xref>]. By regulating autonomic stress, buspirone could therefore safeguard against the triggers that cause EBAD to worsen (such as deteriorating cardiac and respiratory symptoms). Buspirone as an adjunct with other medication(s) might therefore be sufficient to impact the quality of life and/or improve the long-term outcomes for RTT patients at higher risk of EBAD. However, this case report involves only one pair of twins, which limits the generalizability of the findings, and this hypothesis would need to be evaluated in a much larger sample. Brain development is dependent on <italic toggle=""yes"">BDNF</italic> function [<xref rid=""B79-cimb-46-00497"" ref-type=""bibr"">79</xref>]. In RTT, <italic toggle=""yes"">BDNF</italic> dysregulation has previously been described [<xref rid=""B80-cimb-46-00497"" ref-type=""bibr"">80</xref>]; however, it is still unclear how <italic toggle=""yes"">MECP2</italic> might regulate <italic toggle=""yes"">BDNF</italic> expression in RTT. Transcript levels of <italic toggle=""yes"">BDNF</italic> vary in the brain of RTT patients [<xref rid=""B81-cimb-46-00497"" ref-type=""bibr"">81</xref>], and post-mortem brain samples from four RTT patients have shown no discernible differences in BDNF immunolabelling compared to controls [<xref rid=""B82-cimb-46-00497"" ref-type=""bibr"">82</xref>]. While animal models are helpful, they are unable to provide a robust framework for <italic toggle=""yes"">MECP2</italic> and <italic toggle=""yes"">BDNF</italic> regulation in patients. Earlier evidence has indicated that <italic toggle=""yes"">BDNF</italic> is a gene target for <italic toggle=""yes"">MECP2</italic> [<xref rid=""B83-cimb-46-00497"" ref-type=""bibr"">83</xref>]. The <italic toggle=""yes"">rs6265 BDNF</italic> polymorphism seems to be a common polymorphism in RTT [<xref rid=""B84-cimb-46-00497"" ref-type=""bibr"">84</xref>] and is suggested to be a disease modifier in RTT patients [<xref rid=""B84-cimb-46-00497"" ref-type=""bibr"">84</xref>,<xref rid=""B85-cimb-46-00497"" ref-type=""bibr"">85</xref>], although there is some conflicting evidence [<xref rid=""B86-cimb-46-00497"" ref-type=""bibr"">86</xref>]. More recently, a bioinformatic meta-analysis using weighted gene correlation network analysis (WGCNA) examined dysregulated genes across an enriched data set and showed that <italic toggle=""yes"">BDNF</italic> is downregulated in RTT [<xref rid=""B87-cimb-46-00497"" ref-type=""bibr"">87</xref>]. Because brain development depends on BDNF function, it is not surprising that <italic toggle=""yes"">BDNF</italic> impairment is implicated in some of the psychopathology observed in different neurodevelopmental disorders [<xref rid=""B79-cimb-46-00497"" ref-type=""bibr"">79</xref>]. Indeed, some evidence also suggests a link between <italic toggle=""yes"">BDNF</italic> polymorphisms and an increased risk for anxiety and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) [<xref rid=""B79-cimb-46-00497"" ref-type=""bibr"">79</xref>]. It is therefore entirely plausible that in the presence of an identical pathogenic <italic toggle=""yes"">MECP2</italic> mutation, a co-occurring <italic toggle=""yes"">rs6265 BDNF</italic> polymorphism that negatively impacts upon BDNF secretion and signalling could lead to a more deleterious impact on brain functioning and, hence, poorer clinical outcomes for twin A. Individualised care is vital for the wellbeing of patients with RTT, and enriched environments can help to improve outcomes in some neurodevelopmental disorders [<xref rid=""B88-cimb-46-00497"" ref-type=""bibr"">88</xref>]. Twin A spent more time in hospital, and it is likely that the associated consequences of hospitalisation for twin A are a driver for worse clinical outcomes. In RTT, environmental enrichment can improve functional outcomes, possibly through the strengthening of neuronal pathways dependent upon BDNF function [<xref rid=""B84-cimb-46-00497"" ref-type=""bibr"">84</xref>]. Our previous evidence synthesis has also indicated that sensory issues can worsen the autonomic profile in RTT [<xref rid=""B89-cimb-46-00497"" ref-type=""bibr"">89</xref>]. When taken together, environmental factors should be considered when examining the divergent clinical profiles of twins A and B. This case report illustrates the impact of precision medicine on the assessment of neurodevelopmental outcomes in RTT. When disease-related genotype–phenotype prognosticators are limited, a multimodal approach that incorporates targeted genotyping and longitudinal physiological monitoring can help disentangle complex clinical symptoms and severity profiles in RTT. We showed that a combination of a co-occurring <italic toggle=""yes"">rs6265 BDNF</italic> polymorphism and autonomic inflexibility led to a poorer clinical outcome for twin A. Using buspirone, we were also able to shift a rigid autonomic profile to a more flexible one for twin A and thereby prevent the cardiac and autonomic symptoms from worsening. In RTT, <italic toggle=""yes"">BDNF</italic> is downregulated [<xref rid=""B87-cimb-46-00497"" ref-type=""bibr"">87</xref>]. While this case report does not explore the ramifications of <italic toggle=""yes"">BDNF</italic> downregulation and its neurobiological underpinnings, <italic toggle=""yes"">BDNF</italic> is likely pleiotropic and affects phenotypic traits dependent on environmental and mental health factors. Therefore, co-occurring <italic toggle=""yes"">BDNF</italic> impairment in RTT could have a far-reaching impact on clinical phenotypes and clinical outcomes. In summary, precision medicine that uses a triumvirate of targeted genotyping, longitudinal objective physiological monitoring, and measures of clinical severity have allowed us to unravel discordant symptom profiles in twins with RTT with an identical pathogenic <italic toggle=""yes"">MECP2</italic> mutation. There could also be a case for a more streamlined approach to developing targeted genotype panels, as previously suggested [<xref rid=""B90-cimb-46-00497"" ref-type=""bibr"">90</xref>]. Targeted genotyping of RTT patients would be quicker and more cost-effective. These aspects are important given that in the UK, barriers to implement genotyping in mental healthcare include cost, lack of knowledge about genotyping, and concerns about how it could be incorporated into the current clinical care workflows [<xref rid=""B91-cimb-46-00497"" ref-type=""bibr"">91</xref>]. Our precision medicine approach, while still in its infancy, can be extended to other areas and would allow clinicians to make informed choices regarding the severity of the illness and the treatment pathway, ultimately leading to improvements in patient care. Nevertheless, this approach must be validated in a larger data set. While the assessment of HRV parameters suggests autonomic inflexibility in twin A compared to twin B, it would be premature to suggest that this pattern would be relevant to the broader RTT population. A much larger sample using biometric sensor-based physiological monitoring would be required to explore the magnitude of awake and sleep longitudinal autonomic disturbances in RTT and how they might influence on clinical outcomes. While twin A had a higher frequency of problems across different symptom domains, symptom frequency using the MPSS would also need to be examined alongside autonomic HRV parameters in a larger sample to better understand group data regarding HRV parameters and clinical severity profiles. The zygosity of the twins was reported in the medical notes by parents. However, we were unable to confirm the zygosity of the twins genetically.",N/A,02 8 2024
Characterizing the journey of Rett syndrome among females in the United States: a real-world evidence study using the Rett syndrome natural history study database,,"Rett syndrome (RTT) is a severe neurodevelopmental disorder that occurs almost exclusively in females, with an estimated incidence of 1 out of every 10,000 to 15,000 live female births worldwide [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR1"">1</xref>–<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR3"">3</xref>]. RTT is clinically diagnosed as classic or atypical based on the manifestation of key clinical symptoms [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR2"">2</xref>], with an average age at diagnosis of 2.5 years [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR2"">2</xref>]. In 90–95% of individuals with classic RTT, the disorder is caused by a spontaneous mutation in the <italic toggle=""yes"">MECP2</italic> gene on the X chromosome [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR2"">2</xref>, <xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR3"">3</xref>]. There are four main criteria required for diagnosing classic RTT, including the partial or complete loss of acquired purposeful hand skills, the partial or complete loss of spoken language, stereotypic hand movements, and gait abnormalities [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR2"">2</xref>]. At least two of the four main criteria are required to diagnose atypical RTT, in addition to at least five of 11 supportive criteria [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR2"">2</xref>, <xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR4"">4</xref>].  Despite an estimated survival of over 70% at 45 years of age [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR5"">5</xref>], RTT is associated with substantial clinical and humanistic burden that translates to poor quality of life (QoL) [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR2"">2</xref>, <xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR6"">6</xref>]. Individuals with RTT often require lifelong care due to a range of symptoms, stemming from neurological, gastrointestinal, cardiac, endocrine, and orthopedic disorders [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR5"">5</xref>, <xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR7"">7</xref>]. However, there is limited longitudinal data describing how the severity of RTT changes over time, underscoring a much-needed area of research. Until recently, treatment options for RTT were limited to symptom management and supportive care for daily activities [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR2"">2</xref>, <xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR4"">4</xref>, <xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR8"">8</xref>]. To promote childhood development, consensus guidelines recommend early referral to physical, occupational, and speech language therapists, as well as establishment of an individualized education program [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR2"">2</xref>]. Anticonvulsants may be used to treat seizures, and maintaining a healthy body mass and monitoring for scoliosis become important considerations as individuals reach late childhood [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR2"">2</xref>].  In March 2023, the United States (US) Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved trofinetide as the first pharmaceutical therapy for RTT [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR9"">9</xref>, <xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR10"">10</xref>]. With the advent of trofinetide for treatment of RTT, a comprehensive understanding of the characteristics and disease journey of individuals with RTT is needed to elucidate on present unmet needs and inform the integration of novel therapies into the current treatment paradigm for RTT. The overarching aim of this study was to characterize females with classic or atypical RTT in the US with respect to their demographic and clinical profiles, and to describe their disease journey with respect to longitudinal patterns of treatment, RTT-related outcomes, and changes in disease severity.   In this retrospective real-world study, we used registry data from the 5211 RHNS study to gain insights into the disease journey of females with RTT in the US with respect to longitudinal treatment patterns, RTT-related outcomes, and changes in disease severity. Our findings suggest that individuals with RTT experience high disease burden, irrespective of RTT type and age group, as evidenced by the high use of supportive therapies, the need for a hospital or emergency room visit in nearly half of all individuals, and the increasing trend in motor-behavioral dysfunction observed over time. To our knowledge, this is the first real-world study to evaluate changes in RTT severity over time, as measured by the CSS and MBA scale. These findings help advance the understanding of short-term changes in RTT severity across RTT type and age group. In this study, most individuals with RTT required supportive therapy, with more use observed in pediatric individuals than adult individuals. These findings are consistent with a recent real-world administrative healthcare claims study of females with RTT, which found that nearly 60% of the overall RTT cohort relied on pharmacologic and supportive therapies to manage symptoms, and the use of supportive therapies was highest during early childhood (3–4 years of age) and decreased markedly by 18 years of age [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR16"">16</xref>]. The most used pharmacological therapies in this study were prokinetic agents and antiepileptic drugs, which aligns with the high rates of gastrointestinal manifestations and epilepsy reported in this population. In one survey of 983 parents of females with RTT in the North American RTT database, 92% reported symptoms of gastrointestinal dysmotility [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR17"">17</xref>], while epilepsy has been estimated to occur in 60–80% of individuals with RTT [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR18"">18</xref>]. As the registry data used in this study spanned up to July 2021, prior to the FDA approval of trofinetide in March 2023 [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR9"">9</xref>, <xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR10"">10</xref>], future real-world evidence studies that encompass data following the approval of trofinetide or other novel therapies are warranted to shed light on its integration into the treatment paradigm for RTT, and its impact on pharmacologic and supportive therapies currently used to manage RTT symptoms. Despite the heavy reliance on pharmacologic and supportive therapies, nearly half of all individuals in our study required a hospital or emergency room visit during the follow-up period. While comparable literature is limited, a previous survey study of 399 individuals with RTT from the International Rett Syndrome Phenotype Database (InterRett) database (95.5% female and 82.2% from the US) found that 21.4% of individuals experienced a hospital admission for lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI) over the previous 5 years [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR19"">19</xref>], a figure that is likely lower due to the capture of LRTI-related hospital admissions rather than all-cause hospital or emergency room visits. Moreover, a higher frequency of hospital or emergency room visits was observed in individuals with classic RTT relative to atypical RTT and in pediatric individuals relative to adult individuals. A registry-based study in Australia similarly observed a higher frequency of hospital admissions in individuals with RTT between the ages of 0–17 years relative to individuals with RTT more than 17 years of age (0–7 years: 22.2%, 8–12 years: 23.7%, 13–17 years: 18.0%, > 17 years: 9.1%) [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR20"">20</xref>], although these findings are not directly comparable to our frequency estimate given that emergency room visits could not be distinguished from hospital visits in this study. As the present study was unable to separately assess the frequency of emergency room visits and hospital visits, an understanding of the severity of healthcare encounters experienced by individuals in this study is limited. In this study, approximately 14% of individuals with RTT underwent incident g-tube surgery during the follow-up period, with a greater incidence in pediatric individuals than adult individuals. Although literature on the incidence of g-tube surgery in individuals with RTT is sparse, prior literature have reported a prevalence of g-tube surgery between 28.0 and 30.3% [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR17"">17</xref>, <xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR21"">21</xref>], which aligns with the prevalence of g-tube surgery that can be delineated from our study given that 153 (33.6%) individuals had a g-tube surgery at baseline or during the study period. The need for invasive g-tube surgery to alleviate feeding difficulties among individuals with RTT, particularly younger individuals, further underscores the considerable burden associated with this disease [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR21"">21</xref>].  Mortality in the present study was rare and aligns with prior literature that reported death in 4.3% of individuals with classic and atypical RTT in the RNHS over a 9-year observation period, with survival exceeding 70% at 45 years of age [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR5"">5</xref>]. The low mortality rates observed in this study may have been driven by the larger representation of pediatric individuals in the overall RTT sample (79.8%) and right-censoring of the RNHS data. Although death during the study was ascertained from death certificates in the RNHS [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR5"">5</xref>], deaths among individuals who withdrew from the study or that occurred after the completion of the study were not systematically captured. As such, mortality rates from this study may be underestimated. Future studies could assess cause-specific mortality in RTT, which is often unknown but has been presumed to be related to cardio-respiratory issues [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR5"">5</xref>], and evaluate the potential value of novel treatments for addressing events that are known drivers of mortality in RTT, such as aspiration. Together, our findings underscore an unmet need for improved symptom management earlier on in the lifespan of individuals with RTT to reduce the burden of this disease and potentially increase survival at older ages. Future studies could assess how novel treatments may impact healthcare resource use and mortality among individuals with RTT, and whether these outcomes vary by type of RTT or individuals’ age. A novel aspect of this study was the assessment of the change in RTT severity per year. Among the overall study sample and in individuals with classic RTT, motor-behavioral dysfunction significantly increased per year. Furthermore, both clinical severity and motor-behavioral dysfunction significantly increased per year among pediatric individuals with RTT. Although not unexpected, these findings highlight the increasing burden of RTT over time. Prior literature investigating individuals with RTT aged 5–18 years in the RNHS identified a significant association between clinical impairment in RTT, as measured by the CSS and MBA, and poor physical QoL [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR6"">6</xref>], suggesting that increasing clinical severity and motor-behavioral dysfunction have important negative impacts on individual’s QoL. Due to missing data for clinical measures, longer-term assessments of CSS and MBA scores among individuals with RTT were not feasible, and the annual change in RTT severity estimated by our models was limited to 2 years of data. While our findings can elucidate on the short-term changes in RTT severity, an understanding of the long-term trends in clinical severity and motor-behavioral dysfunction is limited, as developmental changes in RTT are generally slow [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR6"">6</xref>]. Future studies may expand upon this analysis by investigating the annual changes in RTT severity over longer periods of time and using other clinical measures, such as the Rett Syndrome Behavior Questionnaire (RSBQ) to assess neurobehavioral severity [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR22"">22</xref>]. Nonetheless, these findings provide additional insight on the changes in RTT severity in the short-term, and how these changes may vary across RTT type and individual’s age. The findings from our study should be interpreted considering some limitations. First, as most RTT-related outcomes and therapies evaluated in this study were reported by caregivers, there is a potential for misspecification of endpoints, given the subjectivity in their assessment. However, estimates reported in this study are corroborated by published RTT literature, suggesting that our findings are representative of the real world. Second, our assessments were limited to the subset of individuals with complete information; the high proportion of missingness observed for certain variables could lead to uncertainty in the estimation of endpoints evaluated in this study. Third, the MBA scale has not been validated in individuals with RTT and as such, the reliability, validity, and relevance of this scale in the RTT population have not been established. Future research assessing motor-behavioral dysfunction in individuals with RTT using a validated instrument are warranted. To our knowledge, this study was the first to assess changes in RTT severity over time and provide novel insights on the short-term trends of this disease in classic and atypical RTT as well as in pediatric and adult individuals. This study used data from the largest registry database specifically designed to collect data on individuals with RTT in the US. The database is uniquely rich in endpoints, such as CSS and MBA scores, allowing for a more comprehensive overview of the treatment and disease journey that might otherwise not be observed in other data sources where data capture may be less complete. Moreover, the results are likely to be generalizable to the broader RTT population. Additionally, the RHNS database has a comprehensive capture of the clinical features of RTT and over-the-counter pharmacologic therapies, which may not be captured in other data sources that necessitate a healthcare encounter or a drug prescription/dispensing, respectively, to be recorded in the database. Findings from this study highlight the considerable burden of RTT across classic and atypical RTT as well as pediatric and adult individuals. Reliance on supportive therapies and healthcare resources to manage debilitating symptoms of RTT was common in the overall study sample and more pronounced in pediatric individuals than adult individuals, highlighting the importance of early interventions to facilitate the long-term management of RTT. Despite the use of pharmacological and supportive therapies, individuals with RTT experience increasing severity of disease with respect to motor-behavioral dysfunction, underscoring the present unmet needs of this population. Future studies may provide additional insights by investigating disease management strategies in the context of novel targeted therapies and elucidate the impact of the evolving treatment landscape on the severity of RTT as well as the QoL of individuals with RTT and their caregivers.

Is trofinetide a future treatment for Rett syndrome? A comprehensive systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials,,"Rett syndrome (RTT) is a rare neurodevelopmental disease that predominantly affects girls and is mainly caused by mutations in the methyl-CpG-binding protein 2 (<italic toggle=""yes"">MECP2</italic>) gene, responsible for the synthesis of the MeCP2 protein [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR1"">1</xref>]. MeCP2 binds to methylated genomic DNA, which is crucial for various physiological functions, including normal neurological development [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR2"">2</xref>]. Consequently, patients with RTT suffer from several neurological disruptions, including speech difficulty, motor dysfunction, hand stereotypies, abnormal gait, and epilepsy [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR1"">1</xref>]. Besides neurological manifestations, RTT affects other systems, leading to abnormalities in growth, the gastrointestinal tract, breathing, and pubertal development [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR3"">3</xref>]. The prevalence of RTT is nearly 5 to 10 cases per 100,000 females worldwide [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR4"">4</xref>]. The cumulative incidence is 1.09 per 10,000 girls by the time they are 12 years old [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR1"">1</xref>].
 The primary management approaches to RTT involve providing symptomatic and supportive treatment, comprising behavioral, physical, occupational, and speech therapy, as well as medication to control seizures and other symptoms. Occupational therapy seeks to lessen stereotypic movements, enhance appropriate hand use, and facilitate daily activity performance. Also, physical and language therapies are required to improve mobility and social life [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR5"">5</xref>]. Studies have assessed the effectiveness of specific drugs in controlling the symptoms of RTT. Naltrexone, an opioid antagonist, was evaluated as a potential treatment for periodic breathing. However, it was associated with significant deterioration in motor function and disorder progression [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR6"">6</xref>]. The discovery of <italic toggle=""yes"">MECP2</italic> mutations and the possible significance of DNA methylation led to the implementation of a folate-betaine trial. Although parents reported improvements, no objective evidence was found [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR7"">7</xref>]. Trofinetide (chemical name: glycyl-l-2-methylprolyl-l-glutamic acid), an analog of insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF1), was considered a potential treatment for RTT. Phase II and III clinical trials, during which it showed improvement in various RTT symptoms at maximum dose [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR8"">8</xref>]. Research conducted on mice with <italic toggle=""yes"">MECP2</italic> mutations showed that the amino-terminal tripeptide of insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1), also known as glypromate, can significantly enhance physiological behavior and improve survival rates [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR9"">9</xref>]. However, it had low bioavailability due to its rapid degradation [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR10"">10</xref>, <xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR11"">11</xref>]. Trofinetide (brand name: Daybue), the synthetic analog of glypromate, which showed more resistance to degradation [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR12"">12</xref>], has been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) as a treatment for RTT in patients 2 years of age and older [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR13"">13</xref>]. Various potential mechanisms of action have been suggested for trofinetide. The stimulation of synaptic maturation and function is one possible mode of action. It also restores dendritic morphology, neuronal signaling, and synaptic protein synthesis to normal, which are all essential for healthy neuronal function. In addition, it shields neurons from damage caused by oxidative stress via its antioxidant response [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR12"">12</xref>, <xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR14"">14</xref>–<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR17"">17</xref>]. Trials conducted by Glaze et al. [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR18"">18</xref>, <xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR19"">19</xref>] and Neul et al. [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR20"">20</xref>] evaluated trofinetide’s efficacy, tolerability, and safety in RTT patients. Additionally, a study conducted by Neul et al. showed that trofinetide exhibited a significant change compared to placebo in the communication ability measuring scales, the caregiver-rated Communication and Symbolic Behavior Scales Developmental Profile™ Infant–Toddler Checklist (CSBS-DP-IT) Social Composite score and the Rett syndrome clinician rating of ability to communicate choices (RTT-COMC) [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR21"">21</xref>]. Furthermore, an exposure–response (E-R) efficacy model by Darwish et al. [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR22"">22</xref>] demonstrated that high trofinetide exposure improved the Rett Syndrome Behavior Questionnaire (RSBQ), CSBS-DP-IT, and RTT-COMC scores. Trofinetide was much better than placebo in reducing RSBQ total scores, with five to seven times greater reductions assuming target trofinetide with area under the concentration–time curve for the dosing interval 0 to 12 h (AUC<sub>0–12</sub>) values of 800–1200 μg·h/mL [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR22"">22</xref>]. LILAC study by Percy et al. [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR23"">23</xref>], a phase III open-label extension study of Neul et al. study [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR20"">20</xref>], assessed the safety and efficacy of trofinetide after 40 weeks of treatment in 154 females with RTT, aged 5–21 years. Trofinetide treatment in this trial was found to sustain improvement in RTT symptoms as measured by several scales like RSBQ [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR23"">23</xref>, <xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR24"">24</xref>]. In the present study, we aimed to provide class-one evidence demonstrating the efficacy and safety of trofinetide in RTT patients. We addressed several domains regarding RTT, including caregiver-completed assessments (Rett Syndrome Behavior Questionnaire (RSBQ), and Caregiver Top 3 Concerns), clinician-completed global assessment (Clinical Global Impression–Improvement (CGI-I)), and clinician-completed syndrome-specific assessments (Motor Behavior Assessment (MBA)). Furthermore, we aimed to provide insights into the safety profile of the drug. Besides, we investigated sources of heterogeneity whenever possible using sensitivity analysis and provided assessment of quality of evidence using GRADE. This systematic review and meta-analysis followed the criteria of the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-analysis (PRISMA) statement [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR25"">25</xref>]. The protocol held a registration number of CRD42024499849 on PROSPERO.  The present meta-analysis provided class-one evidence about trofinetide efficacy and safety in RTT patients. It included three studies with 276 patients, aged 5–44 years, in the pooled analysis. Regarding the clinician-completed measures, trofinetide significantly improved RTT severity by reducing the CGI-I score by 0.35 points. Besides, the caregiver-completed assessments were improved by reducing the RSBQ total score by almost three and a half points. Both of the aforementioned outcomes are complementary and reflect functionally critical dimensions of RTT. As the most widely employed instrument in RTT investigations, the RSBQ is validated over a broad spectrum of ages (2–47 years) and has associations with functioning [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR34"">34</xref>–<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR36"">36</xref>]. Furthermore, the CGI-I, which is also a widely used clinical scale in RTT trials, adds clinical context to a care-giver outcome like RSBQ [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR18"">18</xref>, <xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR19"">19</xref>, <xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR37"">37</xref>–<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR41"">41</xref>]. It is noteworthy that the changes in CGI-I and RSBQ total scores in this meta-analysis are almost similar to the changes exhibited across all the participating trials. Given that all the participating trials had a Cohen’s <italic toggle=""yes"">d</italic> effect size for their CGI-I and RSBQ outcomes ranging from 0.4 to 0.6, this implies medium clinically meaningful improvements [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR42"">42</xref>]. The most notable side effect of these improvements was vomiting (<italic toggle=""yes"">P </italic>= 0.001). Interestingly, diarrhea was not significant (<italic toggle=""yes"">P</italic> = 0.05). It is worth mentioning that diarrhea was the most frequent and leading cause of treatment discontinuations, if present, among participants [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR19"">19</xref>, <xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR20"">20</xref>]. However, it did not influence overall tolerability and resolved shortly after trofinetide cessation. Even a subset of caregivers who experienced diarrhea with their patients reported their willingness to continue treatment [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR43"">43</xref>]. Although the diarrhea intensity exceeded the caregivers’ expectations, it was viewed as being difficult to manage. However, the caregivers reported some strategies to deal with diarrhea like increasing dietary fiber, being prepared for cleanup, and adjusting the drug dose [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR43"">43</xref>]. Although lowering the dose improved diarrhea in some candidates, a post-hoc analysis of the Neul et al. study (LAVENDER) revealed that the starting dose didn’t significantly affect the incidence of diarrhea. The rates were 69.2%, 88.0%, 83.3%, and 83.3% for initial doses of 150 to < 250, 250 to < 300, 300 to < 350, and 350 to < 500 mg/kg administered twice daily, respectively [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR44"">44</xref>]. However, it is important to note that the aforementioned doses are relatively large and were a source of heterogeneity in our meta-analysis. Although diarrhea was statistically insignificant in our analysis (<italic toggle=""yes"">P</italic> = 0.05), sensitivity analysis by removing Glaze et al. [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR18"">18</xref>] yielded a statistically significant risk for developing diarrhea (OR: 18.51, 95% CI: 9.3 to 36.84, <italic toggle=""yes"">P</italic> = 0.001). Glaze et al. [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR18"">18</xref>] used a lower dose of 70 mg/kg compared to 200 mg/kg in Glaze et al. [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR19"">19</xref>] and Neul et al. [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR20"">20</xref>]. The dosing effect might also explain the low prevalence of diarrhea in other trials using trofinetide for fragile X syndrome that used doses of 35 and 70 mg/kg daily [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR45"">45</xref>]. In addition to dosing, RTT is associated with constipation [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR46"">46</xref>, <xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR47"">47</xref>]. Constipation is managed in RTT using different medications [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR48"">48</xref>, <xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR49"">49</xref>] as reported in Neul et al. study [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR20"">20</xref>] where about 60% of trofinetide group was taking drugs to treat constipation, which might be considered, in theory, a confounding element. It is unclear whether incidence of diarrhea was similar between RTT patients on or off drugs to treat constipation. However, it appears that RTT increases the susceptibility to trofinetide-induced diarrhea; in a phase 1 study, 41 healthy adults were administered trofinetide approximately 160 mg/kg once daily, and no treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) related to diarrhea were reported [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR50"">50</xref>]. Therefore, it is recommended to stop or reduce all drugs to treat constipation upon starting trofinetide and consider an individualized approach for each patient [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR44"">44</xref>]. An individualized approach is crucial in RTT treatment because a pivotal contributor to the phenotype is the location of the mutation on the X chromosome. The mutation location contributes to various degrees of X chromosome inactivation and skewing [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR51"">51</xref>, <xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR52"">52</xref>]. The phenotype severity of RTT can also be correlated with the genotype. Patients who carried either missense variants or late truncating variants seem to have a milder phenotype. For instance, a study reported that patients with the R133C variant exhibited a less severe phenotype than those with the R168X variant. Moreover, the latter was associated with a more severe phenotype than R294X variant-bearing patients [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR53"">53</xref>]. As a result, Glaze et al. [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR18"">18</xref>] randomized participants according to loci of the <italic toggle=""yes"">MECP2</italic> variant, proximal to R294X versus R294X and distally, creating a similar distribution of variants across the experimented cohorts. Nevertheless, none of the involved clinical trials provided any information regarding the efficacy of trofinetide according to the different types of variants. As a consequence, it is quite challenging to determine any correlation between trofinetide and particular variants. In the majority of participants, trofinetide positive effects were diminished after cessation of the drug. This might entail longer-term treatment to investigate such sequelae and substantiate increased clinical benefits with longer durations. Furthermore, the Glaze et al. [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR19"">19</xref>] study showed more manifest improvements than that of Glaze et al. [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR18"">18</xref>]. These improvements could be attributed to some clinically crucial factors. First and foremost, younger age was clearer in Glaze et al. [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR19"">19</xref>] with a mean age of nine compared to 24 in Glaze et al. [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR18"">18</xref>] (refer to baseline characteristics table). Aging has been linked to diminished neuroplasticity [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR54"">54</xref>–<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR56"">56</xref>], and the lack of a functional <italic toggle=""yes"">MECP2</italic> protein—the most common cause of RTT—prematurely closes a window of neuronal plasticity in a brain region involved in social memory. Since trofinetide is believed to enhance synaptic functions and restore synaptic structure [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR12"">12</xref>, <xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR14"">14</xref>, <xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR15"">15</xref>], it is likely to lead to more significant improvements if administered at a younger age. Second, drug doses were higher in the Glaze et al. (2019) study [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR19"">19</xref>], corresponding to increased drug exposure. Finally, the longer duration—42 days compared to 28 days—might have contributed to the observed increased improvements. Besides, heterogeneity was evident in our pooled analysis of diarrhea and irritability (<italic toggle=""yes"">I</italic><sup>2</sup> = 80%, <italic toggle=""yes"">P</italic> = 0.007 and <italic toggle=""yes"">I</italic><sup>2</sup> = 58%, <italic toggle=""yes"">P</italic> = 0.09), respectively. We assume that the aforementioned differences regarding drug doses (i.e., 70 mg in Glaze et al. [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR18"">18</xref>] compared to 200 mg in the others), different treatment durations, altered patients’ tolerability to the drug, administration of drugs to treat constipation, and a wide spectrum of genotype variations might account for the observed heterogeneity. Males diagnosed with RTT were not enrolled in any of the clinical trials conducted until this time. <italic toggle=""yes"">MECP2</italic> variants have been believed for a long time to be lethal in males; however, such cases were identified with a wide range spectrum of phenotypes, and nine variants that have not been seen in females beforehand are reported in males. Eventually, this led to the introduction a new entity called “Male RTT Encephalopathy” [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR57"">57</xref>]. Moreover, males exhibit <italic toggle=""yes"">MECP2</italic> duplication syndrome more frequently than RTT, which both have many clinical features in common [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR58"">58</xref>]. The aforementioned aspects highlight the profound difference in RTT diagnosis between males and females accounting for the plausible exclusion of males from these clinical trials. This study stands out at some points, including conducting a sensitivity analysis, which revealed that lower doses were associated with a lower incidence of diarrhea. Furthermore, we performed a GRADE assessment to evaluate the quality of the evidence, providing a more rigorous and structured appraisal of the evidence. Our study provided a detailed discussion on the incidence of diarrhea in RTT patients in the context of trofinetide treatment, aiming for a clearer understanding. The present study provided quantitative and qualitative evidence on the efficacy and safety of trofinetide on a wide spectrum of RTT patients, ranging from 5 to 44 years old. However, the optimism of this study must be titrated by the lack of assessing the safety and efficacy of trofinetide in the long term. Moreover, the analyzed cohort is small, which is understandable given the rarity of the investigated disease. Besides, males suffering from RTT were not enrolled in any of the participating studies due to phenotype variability in males. Moreover, the youngest age investigated in the participating studies was 5 years. We believe that earlier administration of the drug may highlight new aspects about the efficacy and safety of the drug. Another limitation is the absence of biomarkers determining responders to trofinetide treatment. Therefore, we recommend that future studies should focus on conducting more RCTs assessing both younger age groups, (i.e., below 5 years of age), and longer-duration treatments to evaluate their effect on treatment efficacy. In addition, they have to consider genotype–phenotype relationships by dividing participants into subgroups based on their mutational type and evaluate the drug efficacy between different mutations. RCTs on males, exclusively, assessing a wide spectrum of mutations are also recommended. In conclusion, this meta-analysis of trofinetide demonstrated statistically significant, moderate clinical improvement in complementary scales of RTT like CGI-I and RSBQ. The safety profile of trofinetide revealed a significant increase in vomiting compared to placebo. Although diarrhea yielded an insignificant result in our analysis, it emerged as a cause for treatment discontinuation in the participating trials, and a statistically significant risk for diarrhea emerged when excluding the study using a lower dose of the drug, hence causing heterogeneity, in the meta-analysis. We underscored the importance of considering genotype–phenotype correlations in evaluating trofinetide’s efficacy, especially given the diverse genetic landscape of RTT. Furthermore, younger ages, longer durations, and male-limited RCTs are required. ",N/A,18 7 2024
Developmental change of brain volume in Rett syndrome in Taiwan,,"Rett syndrome (RTT), a rare neurodevelopmental disease, may present with an exclusive trajectory change in clinical phenotypes. The 2010 revision of diagnostic criteria defined main, supporting criteria and exclusion criteria, reflecting the neurological progression of the disease [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR38"">38</xref>]. Although individuals with RTT may have a small head circumference, they generally develop normally till the age of 6–18 months [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR24"">24</xref>], after which they exhibit progressive problems in motor coordination, learning, memory, communication, and other neurodevelopment. Typical patients with RTT may present with a partial or complete loss of acquired hand skills, followed by stereotypical hand movements. Moreover, communication and mobility are impaired or absent, and most patients require assistance in their daily life [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR23"">23</xref>, <xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR24"">24</xref>, <xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR38"">38</xref>]. Therefore, the clinical presentations of individuals with RTT may be classified into 4 stages based on the progression of the disease [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR38"">38</xref>]. In Stage I of RTT, there is an early onset of developmental stagnation, which begins at approximately 6 months to 1.5 years of age, and microcephaly and loss of language gradually begin to appear. In Stage 2, developmental regression occurs at 1–4 years of age, and the affected individuals lose acquired skills in language and behavior. In Stage 3, which develops at approximately 4–7 years of age, some individuals with RTT may regain certain abilities such as communication or language skills. In Stage 4, there is further deterioration of motor skills, and individuals may become nonambulatory and have more severe scoliosis. The methyl-CpG-binding protein 2 (<italic toggle=""yes"">MECP2</italic>) gene, a crucial gene that causes RTT, was first identified as a nuclear protein with a transcriptional repressor role. It is expressed in very early neuronal progenitors and has a well-known function in neurodevelopment. MECP2 plays a crucial role in neuronal maturation, terminal differentiation, and synaptic formation [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR33"">33</xref>]. The expression of MECP2 is highest in the cerebral cortex and cerebellum, and the expression can continue into adulthood and is also much higher in adult brain than that in the infantile stage. Therefore, it can also affect the development of brain and its function in adulthood [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR13"">13</xref>, <xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR21"">21</xref>, <xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR35"">35</xref>]. MECP2, as a key epigenetic modulator in the brain, is involved in promoting embryonic development and stem cell differentiation and therefore plays a critical role in human disease. The normal development of the brain is associated with age and follows a specific pattern of cortical development and functions [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR30"">30</xref>]. The intracranial space increases dramatically after birth but increases very slightly after the first decade [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR42"">42</xref>]. There are increases in the cortical area, decreases in cortical thickness, and variable changes in cortical volume in different regions. There are also increases in the volumes of cerebral subcortical structures, such as deep nuclei, and the cerebellum, when the expression of MECP2 increases [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR8"">8</xref>]. During childhood and adolescence stages, dynamic changes occur in different brain structures, exhibiting continuous age-related decreases in the volumes of the frontal cortex, thalamus, and nucleus accumbens, and the cerebral white matter volume also increases during childhood and early adulthood [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR8"">8</xref>, <xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR42"">42</xref>]. The developing gray matter also reaches the peak of growth in later childhood, after which it decreases linearly with age [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR11"">11</xref>]. Nevertheless, there has been no study focusing on the longitudinal age-related change in brain volume using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The only study on age–brain volume correlation in RTT demonstrated a decrease in the size of the cerebellum with age, but there was no evidence of a progressive decrease in the volume of the cerebral cortex with age [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR37"">37</xref>]. Moreover, the majority of studies on brain volume changes in RTT focused on children and adolescents, when most individuals are in stages 2–3, but not on adults, when the expression of MECP2 is higher than that in childhood, and the individuals are in stage 4 [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR6"">6</xref>, <xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR9"">9</xref>, <xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR20"">20</xref>, <xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR37"">37</xref>, <xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR40"">40</xref>]. The clinical stages may also reflect the brain development of these individuals with RTT. Therefore, the effect of <italic toggle=""yes"">MECP2</italic> on the brain in different stages of RTT has been less investigated in the past, especially regarding the difference in younger age and older age when the staging is different. MRI is a widespread and noninvasive neuroimaging tool for evaluating brain structure and function and for investigating the association between neural activities and clinical events. An MRI study using quantitative measurement revealed a widespread decrease in gray matter volume but a relative preservation of the posterior occipital region in RTT [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR37"">37</xref>]. However, Reiss et al. [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR40"">40</xref>] published the first volumetric MRI study that computed the brain by classifying it into 16 regions and suggested that the largest decrease in cortical gray matter volume was in the frontal region. There was also greater loss of gray matter compared with white matter. Significant reductions were also observed in the parietal and superior parieto-occipital region and basal ganglia in subcortical areas [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR40"">40</xref>]. Another study that used the Talairach data processing and voxel-based morphometry recruited patients aged 5–12 years demonstrated a reduction in the volume of the frontal lobe and dorsal parietal region [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR9"">9</xref>]. Furthermore, two small cohort studies on adolescent and adult patients demonstrated a comparative reduction in brain volume in the frontal lobe, temporal lobe, and cerebellum [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR6"">6</xref>, <xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR20"">20</xref>]. Although previous studies have investigated the change in gray matter volume in RTT, the effect of age-related changes on cortical gray matter was rarely reported [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR6"">6</xref>, <xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR20"">20</xref>]. This study focused on region-dependent brain volume changes in the cortical gray matter in individuals of younger age and older age with RTT. We explored the increasing trend of intracranial volume and cortical gray matter volume in individuals with RTT compared with that in neurotypical individuals.   To our best knowledge, this is the first study on RTT investigating the effect of age on the changes in TIV, cerebral white matter volume, and cortical gray matter volume, especially in younger and older age groups. Although most previous studies have reported about the changes in brain weight and volume in individuals with RTT [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR6"">6</xref>, <xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR9"">9</xref>, <xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR20"">20</xref>, <xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR37"">37</xref>, <xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR40"">40</xref>], our investigation is a pioneering study that focused on the correlation between age and brain volume within a larger age range using MRI. We enrolled 28 participants aged 2–27 years who underwent MRI examinations and divided them into younger and older groups for comparison. Individuals in the younger group were in stages 2–4, whereas those in the older group were in stages 3–4. Results demonstrated a significant decrease in the brain volume of different lobes in participants with RTT compared with that in controls. The difference became larger in adulthood when the individuals were in stages 3–4. The clinical features of RTT are characterized by progressive motor and cognitive deficits [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR23"">23</xref>, <xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR24"">24</xref>] and are classified into four stages depending on the clinical manifestations. In our study, the results obtained from RSSS supported the deterioration of clinical severity in the older RTT group when the patients reached the later stage of RTT. <italic toggle=""yes"">MECP2</italic> controls neuronal development of the brain, regulates neuronal maturation, and even affects neural development and functions in adults [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR2"">2</xref>, <xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR4"">4</xref>, <xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR7"">7</xref>, <xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR13"">13</xref>, <xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR21"">21</xref>, <xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR22"">22</xref>, <xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR35"">35</xref>]. A mouse study demonstrated a higher expression of MECP2 in the adult brain, suggesting that the negative effect of MECP2 dysfunction on the brain is more significant in adulthood when individuals with RTT progressed to stages 3–4 in clinical severity. Neuropathological research has demonstrated some obvious changes in the total brain volume and cerebral size in RTT. Reduced brain size was not attributed to atrophy but to smaller neuronal soma size and dendritic arborizations in the cerebral cortex [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR3"">3</xref>], which may originate from the role and dysfunction of MECP2 in the brain. Nonetheless, there is a paucity of information on the parameters of brain to understand brain development in RTT. Our study demonstrated a decrease in brain volume in most cerebral lobes in participants with RTT compared with that in controls, providing a significant parameter to follow up the development of brain in individuals with RTT. This is a pioneering MRI study that investigated brain volume development in participants with RTT from early childhood to adulthood and compared the difference in younger age and older age in different stages of RTT. Multiple valuable findings were highlighted in this study as follows: (1) the clinical severity increased with age, and older participants presented similar motor performance as that of younger participants; (2) the TIV and cerebral white matter volume significantly increased with age in typically developed brain compared with that in RTT-affected brain; (3) the gray matter in each cortical region typically follows a specific developmental change and decreases at a certain age. A significant volume decrease with age was found in bilateral parietal lobes and the left occipital lobe of participants with RTT; and (4) the differences in cortical gray matter volume between typically developing brain and RTT-affected brain may tend to continuously increase until adulthood when individuals with RTT reach clinical stage 4.

qPCR assay optimisation for a clinical study comparing oral health risk in Rett syndrome,,"Oral health risk assessment is an important tool to inform the dental management and the balance between preventive and aggressive management approaches. Currently, AAPD CRAF (American Academy of Pediatric Dentistry <xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR3"">2022</xref>) tool and ADA CRA tool (American Dental Association <xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR4"">2023a</xref>, <xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR5"">b</xref>) both list special healthcare needs as a moderate or high-risk factor for dental caries. In general, while there are known medical conditions that we know modify risk factors, the current body of knowledge is not exhaustive. Specifically, there are a number of conditions, such as intellectual and developmental disabilities (IDD), where the oral health risk relative to the general population is not known. For example, there are (Dieguez-Perez et al. <xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR12"">2016</xref>) conflicting suggestions on the effect of salivary pH and salivary osmolality on dental caries risk (Ruiz et al. <xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR35"">2018</xref>; Santos et al. <xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR37"">2014</xref>). Similarly, other conflicting systematic reviews exist for autism spectrum disorder (ASD) (Da Silva et al. <xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR11"">2017</xref>; Lam et al. <xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR26"">2020</xref>). Given the dearth of knowledge on the IDD conditions, it is with less certainty that one can accurately comment on how other rarer IDD conditions function as effect modifiers on oral health risk and how it influences that individual’s oral health trajectory. The use of an objective means to measure relative oral health risk would be useful to balance preventive with more aggressive oral health management approaches on a population-based level for a targeted disability sub-group where clinical examination may be difficult. One objective approach to assessing oral health risk has involved quantification of selected bacteria in the oral microbiome as representative oral health indicators, through applications, such as quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR), where published assays have been designed either for primer-based or probe-and-primer-based qPCR reactions. After all, of the validated CRATs that exist, only CAMBRA includes bacterial culture counts as a modifying risk factor, and for <italic toggle=""yes"">mutans streptococci</italic> and <italic toggle=""yes"">lactobacillus spp.</italic> only. For dental caries, one commonly used bacteria is <italic toggle=""yes"">Streptococcus mutans</italic>, which is a known bacterial species present in many cases of dental caries. More recently, <italic toggle=""yes"">Scardovia wiggsiae</italic> has been identified as a bacterial species present in dental caries even in the absence of <italic toggle=""yes"">S. mutans</italic> (Isaac et al. <xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR18"">2022</xref>), and <italic toggle=""yes"">Porphyromonas gingivalis</italic> has been identified as being present in gingivitis. One known indicator of dental health is <italic toggle=""yes"">Corynebacterium durum</italic> (Dinakaran et al. <xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR13"">2018</xref>), as well as <italic toggle=""yes"">Rothia dentocariosa</italic>, a low-virulence commensal generally considered an indicator for both dental and gingival health (Yeung et al. <xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR43"">2014</xref>) but found in greater amounts in those with high caries risk (AlEraky et al. <xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR2"">2021</xref>). Another indicator of gingival health is the strain <italic toggle=""yes"">Fusobacterium nucleatum subsp. fusiforme</italic>, or more recently re categorised as <italic toggle=""yes"">F. nucleatum subsp. vincentii</italic> (Gharbia et al. <xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR16"">1990</xref>; Lourenço et al. <xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR28"">2014</xref>). One advantage of quantifying and comparing oral bacterial species to assess oral health risk is that it provides a quantitative approach and can therefore be useful to evaluate comparative oral health for rare diseases. However, this would require collection of dental plaque samples and accepted protocols usually utilise cold storage at the time of collection. This is a barrier for sample collection in rarer diseases due to low birth prevalence and potential requirement for extensive travel for sample collection, particularly in countries with sparser population distribution. Currently, room temperature storage of samples for up to 17 years is possible using archival cards (Whatman FTA cards), which contain chemical reagents to lyse bacteria and denature proteins, and rapidly inactivate microorganisms, preventing the growth of bacteria, whilst also protecting nucleic acids from nucleases, oxidation and UV damage. Using these cards allows capture of the nucleic acids required for later molecular analysis in one step, and they remain immobilised in the card and preserved for both transport and long-term storage at room temperature (Aldrich <xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR1"">2020</xref>). However, storage of dental bacterial samples on FTA cards, and subsequent DNA extraction for use in qPCR, has not been reported and validated in the literature. Furthermore, existing protocols for swabbing times prior to FTA card storage for those with IDD may be challenging due to compliance. The low DNA yields expected from samples of individuals with special healthcare needs, and potentially low DNA yields from other DNA extraction methods for bacterial samples, would necessitate testing of samples collected using tried methods such as nylon flocked swabs, as well as samples containing known or high quantities of bacteria as positive controls as proof of concept of the efficacy of DNA extraction from FTA cards which have not previously been used for this application or published elsewhere in the literature. Another challenge with using qPCR assays to evaluate oral bacterial species is that the specificity of the approach is limited by the specificity of the <italic toggle=""yes"">in-vivo</italic> assay design, which must meet strict parameters before wet-lab testing, adding to the expense, particularly for assays using a hydrolysis probe. Further, an extensive literature search was conducted for existing assays that were either species or strain-specific. This revealed that many published sequences were problematic. For several publications, the amplicon target was not found in the corresponding accession number or <italic toggle=""yes"">FASTA</italic> sequence (Avila‐Campos et al. <xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR8"">1999</xref>; Lochman et al. <xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR27"">2019</xref>), even when the version number was given. In other publications, the left or right primer was missing entirely from the target amplicon (Sakamoto et al. <xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR36"">2001</xref>; Topcuoglu et al. <xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR41"">2013</xref>; Tran and Rudney <xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR42"">1999</xref>; Yoshida et al. <xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR44"">2003</xref>), or at least one of the primers had a high mispriming score (Ammann et al. <xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR7"">2013</xref>; Kim et al. <xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR19"">2004</xref>; Park et al. <xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR33"">2013</xref>) or had an unacceptable melting temperature (Tm) (Tanner et al. <xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR40"">2011</xref>). Importantly, many primer sets had multiple off-targets when checking with <italic toggle=""yes"">primer-BLAST</italic>. Most assays used only primers and not probes. The two major problems, being a lack of specific qPCR assays and lack of a tried and tested approach for prolonged dental sample storage at room temperature for qPCR testing, were the barriers the authors wished to overcome. This prompted us to undertake a proof-of-concept study involving interstate travel across Australia to collect and compare dental plaque samples from both individuals with Rett syndrome (RTT), and their sibling control participants, to gain more accurate assessment of their relative oral health risk where there is a lack of information. Rett syndrome is an X-linked neurodevelopmental disorder mainly affecting females (Neul et al. <xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR31"">2010</xref>) that occurs in approximately 1 in 9000 female live births (Fehr et al. <xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR14"">2011</xref>). <italic toggle=""yes"">MECP2</italic> is the main gene implicated (Amir et al. <xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR6"">1999</xref>). Patients with RTT develop progressive cognitive impairment after a period of relative normalcy, and experience severe or profound intellectual disability. In a recent literature review, the research team has summarised the current state of knowledge with respect to oral health problems in RTT (Lai et al. <xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR22"">2018a</xref>, <xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR21"">b</xref>). In a recent study, our team examined the oral health experiences of patients with RTT by accessing data on the Australian Rett Syndrome Database (ARSD) (Lai et al. <xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR21"">2018b</xref>). A major deficit that we identified in the literature is a lack of comparisons to healthy controls. Only one small clinical study to date included a control group (Fuertes-Gonzalez and Silvestre <xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR15"">2014</xref>), involving clinical examination but no microbial analyses of oral microflora. Therefore, with this in mind, this study aimed to develop a suite of qPCR assays for specific microbiota as indicators of oral health and disease (namely, <italic toggle=""yes"">S. mutans, S. wiggsiae, C. durum, R. dentocariosa, P. gingivalis</italic>, and <italic toggle=""yes"">F. nucleatum</italic> subsp<italic toggle=""yes"">. fusiforme;</italic> and to test the suitability of FTA cards for oral bacterial sample storage and test DNA extraction of oral bacterial samples from FTA cards for use in real-time qPCR as a proof-of-concept for application in a future study to compare oral microflora collected from samples collected from those with RTT and their sibling controls. It was hypothesised that DNA extraction of bacterial DNA from dental plaque samples stored on Whatman FTA cards would be comparable to DNA extracted of bacterial DNA from dental plaque samples stored on the nylon swabs used to transfer the sample from the mouth to the FTA card, and that the DNA extracted from bacterial DNA from dental plaque samples stored on Whatman FTA cards would be sufficient quantity and quality for downstream analysis using real-time qPCR. It was also hypothesised that real-time qPCR assays designed for <italic toggle=""yes"">S. mutans, S. wiggsiae, C. durum, R. dentocariosa, P. gingivalis</italic>, and <italic toggle=""yes"">F. nucleatum</italic> subsp<italic toggle=""yes"">. fusiforme</italic> would be specific, and would run with an efficiency between 90 and 110%, using DNA extracted from Whatman FTA cards.   This is the first study to detail qPCR optimisation procedures for dental plaque samples collected on FTA cards, which allow room temperature storage when cold storage is not feasible or when data collection involves extensive travel. The study confirmed that samples of dental plaque stored on FTA cards, were suitable for use in qPCR tests, and that a modified Powersoil DNA extraction protocol provided the best DNA yield and quality. The qPCR assays and synthetic standards that were designed and optimised, cover organisms associated with presence of dental disease, dental health, gingival health, and gingival disease. It was intended that the species-specific assays <italic toggle=""yes"">S. mutans, S. wiggsiae, P. gingivalis, C. durum</italic> and <italic toggle=""yes"">R. dentocariosa/R. aeria</italic> would allow detection using real time qPCR with high specificity. While the use of proprietary qPCR assays made has provided much convenience, significant supplier-related delays related to the COVID-19 pandemic precluded their use, especially given a fixed travelling schedule for interstate data collection. Custom assays had a two-week turnaround time to delivery as opposed to two months for the proprietary assays. Conducting multiple sequence alignment and in silico design of species-specific assays is more time-consuming, however, the user has more control over performance of the assays and can verify their efficiency. Additionally, the MIQE guidelines for publication of qPCR data specify publication of sequences and efficiency data as essential and this is not possible with use of proprietary assays. Four of the assays (<italic toggle=""yes"">S. wiggsiae, C. durum, P. gingivalis, and F. nucleatum</italic> subsp. <italic toggle=""yes"">fusiforme</italic>) were run with at least three biological replicates in triplicate, with two (<italic toggle=""yes"">S. mutans, R. dentocariosa</italic>) run with five biological replicates which included a COPAN FLOQswab and its corresponding FTA sample. All assays were run with samples A19, B19 and C19, which included an identical sample that was cultured BHI and on an FTA card. It was generally observed that there was up to ten-fold decrease in the gene copy numbers on the FTA cards when comparing this to the swabs. However, this was not the case for two of the six assays. Firstly, the sample labelled A19 showed gene copy numbers in the order of almost 10^3 for the <italic toggle=""yes"">F. nucleatum</italic> assay but with indeterminate readings on the corresponding FTA card sample, and this observation was replicated in both runs at 60<italic toggle=""yes""> °C</italic> and 60.7<italic toggle=""yes""> °C</italic> annealing temperature. It is hypothesised that the microstructural properties of <italic toggle=""yes"">F. nucleatum</italic> may preclude its extraction from the FTA card due to its abundance of sticky adhesins (Han et al. <xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR17"">2005</xref>; Muchova et al. <xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR30"">2022</xref>). Separately, it is noted that other researchers have observed issues with <italic toggle=""yes"">F. nucleatum</italic> for checkerboard analysis (Benn et al. <xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR9"">2022</xref>) but their observation may be linked to lack of specificity due to its similarity with other strains of <italic toggle=""yes"">F. nucleatum</italic> (Socransky et al. <xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR39"">2004</xref>). Overall, the <italic toggle=""yes"">F. nucleatum</italic> subsp. <italic toggle=""yes"">fusiforme</italic> assay in this body of work was optimised to an efficiency within 0.5% of the industry threshold of 90%, and while it may not be suited to use with FTA card samples, it may probably be acceptable to use with other standard nylon swabs if other assays cannot be found with no off-targets; this should be verified through further work. It is noteworthy to mention that the publication of the primer set (Shin et al. <xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR38"">2010</xref>) was published before <italic toggle=""yes"">F. nucleatum subsp. fusiforme</italic> was considered to be related to <italic toggle=""yes"">F. nucleatum subsp. vincentii</italic> some years later. The <italic toggle=""yes"">R. dentocariosa/R. aeria</italic> assay was the second assay which showed a departure from the general observation of a ten-fold decrease between A19 and B19 samples or from corresponding swab to FTA card samples. For this assay, fewer gene copies were noted on the (culture in BHI) A19 sample than sample B19 on the FTA card. It may be that the microstructural properties of the bacteria make it more susceptible to DNA degradation during the vortex mixing step of the Powersoil protocol, whereas it may not have been as affected with the same degree of agitation of the FTA card during vortexing. Perhaps this theory could be tested by reducing the vortex mixing time if using culture in Powersoil reaction, although this may have limited applicability to this clinical situation where samples would be expected to be on swabs as opposed to culture. With the exception of the <italic toggle=""yes"">F. nucleatum</italic> subsp. <italic toggle=""yes"">fusiforme</italic> and <italic toggle=""yes"">R. dentocariosa/R. aeria</italic> assays, most assays showed low or even single gene copy numbers on the test samples, especially <italic toggle=""yes"">S. mutans</italic> and <italic toggle=""yes"">S. wiggsiae.</italic> This may have occurred as the test samples were mostly swabbed from relatively healthy subjects. Additionally, for the re-run of <italic toggle=""yes"">P. gingivali</italic>s which was performed some months after the initial test run, observed gene copy counts for biological replicates were up to one-tenth of the observed amounts in Primer test 1, suggesting DNA degradation. The discrepancies observed in the efficiency of the standard curve between the initial and the repeat runs of <italic toggle=""yes"">P. gingivalis</italic> may have arisen due to pipetting error, despite use of a pipetting robot. Alternatively, the TE buffer was used in the resuspension protocol and the EDTA may have acted as an inhibitor; this may be unlikely as the efficiency was not affected during the first test run. While it may have been ideal, it was not feasible to use DNA template from samples collected from the Rett syndrome subjects in the overall multicentre study due to only 50 µL being available for limited runs of assays. In several assays, gene copy numbers were less than the limit of quantification (LOQ) or outside the range of the standard curve, and so there is merit in optimising the same qPCR assays for use in digital droplet PCR instruments where standard curves are not required due to calculations being performed at the end point as opposed to in “real time” as with qPCR, thus minimising potential effect of inhibitors. This would allow more validity for an experiment if one was expecting low gene copy numbers as with the intended clinical study due to a) the nature of swabbing procedure on those with severe intellectual disability and b) expected loss of sample on FTA card, which was not as obvious when assessing DNA concentration following DNA extraction, but more noticeable when during qPCR optimisation. With the limitations of expected low DNA yield and a 50 µL elution volume of extracted DNA, the lowest reaction volume was chosen (2ul) in line with the parameters outlined in the manufacturer mastermix protocol. The disadvantage of using little DNA template was the increased likelihood of subsampling error particularly in the presence of low gene copies. If future optimisation of these qPCR assays is conducted on a dPCR instrument, then issues with potential subsampling error should be explored during dPCR optimisation by testing singleplex assays at 2 µL, 4 µL, and 6 µL and also through a trial of duplexing of different combinations of assays with SUN fluorophore an assay with a FAM fluorophore. If multiplexing is successful on a dPCR machine, then it would be best to increase the DNA template amount given the finite volume of precious DNA samples. The present work details a novel approach to sample collection and DNA extraction from dental plaque when cold storage is not feasible, using FTA cards. Additionally, this work outlines the design and validation of assays and synthetic standards for absolute quantitation using real time qPCR. With the exception of <italic toggle=""yes"">F. nucleatum subsp. fusiforme,</italic> most assays, namely <italic toggle=""yes"">S. mutans, S. wiggsiae, C. durum, R. dentocariosa,</italic> and <italic toggle=""yes"">P. gingivalis,</italic> allowed detection using real time qPCR with high specificity on samples collected on FTA cards. Assays generally had good efficiency. However, for several assays, low gene copy numbers in test samples were lower than the LOQ. Future work could explore optimisation of the same qPCR assays for use with dPCR. ",N/A,26 6 2024
"Co-Occurring Methylenetetrahydrofolate Reductase (<italic toggle=""yes"">MTHFR</italic>) rs1801133 and rs1801131 Genotypes as Associative Genetic Modifiers of Clinical Severity in Rett Syndrome","Aim: Remethylation disorders such as 5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (<italic toggle=""yes"">MTHFR</italic>) deficiency reduce the remethylation of homocysteine to methionine. The resulting hyperhomocysteinemia can lead to serious neurological consequences and multisystem toxicity. The role of <italic toggle=""yes"">MTHFR</italic> genotypes has not been investigated in patients with Rett Syndrome (RTT). In this study, we sought to assess the impact of co-occurring <italic toggle=""yes"">MTHFR</italic> genotypes on symptom profiles in RTT. Method: Using pharmacogenomic (PGx) testing, the <italic toggle=""yes"">MTHFR</italic> genetic polymorphisms rs1801133 (c.665C>T mutation) and rs1801131 (c.1286A>C mutation) were determined in 65 patients (18.7 years ± 12.1 [mean ± standard deviation]) with RTT as part of routine clinical care within the Centre for Interventional Paediatric Psychopharmacology (CIPP) Rett Centre, a National and Specialist Child and Adolescent Mental Health Service (CAMHS) in the UK. The clinical severity of patients was assessed using the RTT-anchored Clinical Global Impression Scale (RTT-CGI). Results: The clinical severity symptom distribution varied between the homozygous and heterozygous <italic toggle=""yes"">MTHFR</italic> rs1801133 and rs1801131 genotypes. Those with the homozygous genotype had a narrower spread of severity scores across several domains (language and communication, ambulation, hand-use and eye contact clinical domains). Patients with the homozygous genotype had statistically significantly greater CGI-Severity scores than individuals with a non-homozygous <italic toggle=""yes"">MTHFR</italic> genotype (Z = −2.44, <italic toggle=""yes"">p</italic> = 0.015). When comparing the ratings of moderately impaired (4), markedly impaired (5), severely impaired (6) and extremely impaired (7), individuals with the homozygous <italic toggle=""yes"">MTHFR</italic> genotype were more impaired than those with the non-homozygous <italic toggle=""yes"">MTHFR</italic> genotype (Z = −2.06, <italic toggle=""yes"">p</italic> = 0.039). There was no statistically significant difference in the number of prescribed anti-epileptic drugs between the genotypes. Conclusions: Our findings show that in those with a pathogenic RTT genetic variant, co-occurring homozygotic <italic toggle=""yes"">MTHFR</italic> rs1801133 and rs1801131 polymorphisms may act as associative genetic modifiers of clinical severity in a subset of patients. Profiling of rs1801133 and rs1801131 in RTT may therefore be useful, especially for high-risk patients who may be at the most risk from symptom deterioration.","The level of unmet need for managing and treating mental health problems within the Rare Disease (RD) community is high. It is impossible to overstate the devastating consequences for those affected and their families, and the significant burden placed upon patients, families, health services, and society. Rett Syndrome (RTT) is an exemplar of a paediatric RD that encompasses both neuropsychiatric and physical problems. It is one of the most recognised models of abnormal synaptic plasticity [<xref rid=""B1-brainsci-14-00624"" ref-type=""bibr"">1</xref>]. Primarily caused by mutations in the protein methyl-CpG-binding protein 2 (MeCP2), RTT has a frequency of 5 to 10 cases per 100,000 females [<xref rid=""B2-brainsci-14-00624"" ref-type=""bibr"">2</xref>]. Where there is a pathogenic variant, the <italic toggle=""yes"">MECP2</italic> gene is suggested to disrupt long gene expression within the brain [<xref rid=""B3-brainsci-14-00624"" ref-type=""bibr"">3</xref>], probably by altering topoisomerase IIβ activity [<xref rid=""B4-brainsci-14-00624"" ref-type=""bibr"">4</xref>]. Although the United Sates Food and Drug Administration (US, FDA) has recently approved Trofinetide in RTT therapeutics [<xref rid=""B5-brainsci-14-00624"" ref-type=""bibr"">5</xref>,<xref rid=""B6-brainsci-14-00624"" ref-type=""bibr"">6</xref>], typical treatment relies on the use of off-label medications [<xref rid=""B1-brainsci-14-00624"" ref-type=""bibr"">1</xref>], which can lead to ineffective doses being used, and may increase the risk of harm to patients and/or poor outcomes. Patients with RTT are at higher risk of adverse drug reactions (ADRs) due to the severity of the illness, co-occurring disorders, and the use of multiple medications. Indeed, in a prospective study of 18,820 adult patients in England, ADRs accounted for 6.5% of hospitalisations [<xref rid=""B7-brainsci-14-00624"" ref-type=""bibr"">7</xref>]. Polypharmacy and multimorbidity contribute to the higher incidence of ADRs [<xref rid=""B8-brainsci-14-00624"" ref-type=""bibr"">8</xref>]. In the UK, a small number of actionable pharmacogenes accounts for most prescription drugs, with 8/10 patients being exposed to at least one drug that was impacted by a variant in an actionable pharmacogene [<xref rid=""B9-brainsci-14-00624"" ref-type=""bibr"">9</xref>]. Methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) deficiency involved in folate metabolism, specifically the synthesis of 5-methyl-tetrahydrofolate (5-MTHF), which is the biologically active form of folate required for the remethylation of homocysteine to methionine, has been associated with neuropsychiatric illness [<xref rid=""B10-brainsci-14-00624"" ref-type=""bibr"">10</xref>]. At present, there are about 247 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of <italic toggle=""yes"">MTHFR</italic> documented in the Single Nucleotide Polymorphism Database (dbSNP) [<xref rid=""B11-brainsci-14-00624"" ref-type=""bibr"">11</xref>] and according to recent evidence, approximately 200 pathogenic <italic toggle=""yes"">MTHFR</italic> variants have been identified [<xref rid=""B12-brainsci-14-00624"" ref-type=""bibr"">12</xref>]. The genetic polymorphisms rs1801133 and rs1801131 are said to be important polymorphisms that have an impact on MTHFR activity [<xref rid=""B13-brainsci-14-00624"" ref-type=""bibr"">13</xref>]. While the selected genetic polymorphisms (rs1801133 and rs1801131) in this study are the only two with a clinical grade pharmacogenomics (PGx) level of evidence [<xref rid=""B14-brainsci-14-00624"" ref-type=""bibr"">14</xref>], these alleles are also related to disease risk [<xref rid=""B15-brainsci-14-00624"" ref-type=""bibr"">15</xref>,<xref rid=""B16-brainsci-14-00624"" ref-type=""bibr"">16</xref>,<xref rid=""B17-brainsci-14-00624"" ref-type=""bibr"">17</xref>,<xref rid=""B18-brainsci-14-00624"" ref-type=""bibr"">18</xref>,<xref rid=""B19-brainsci-14-00624"" ref-type=""bibr"">19</xref>,<xref rid=""B20-brainsci-14-00624"" ref-type=""bibr"">20</xref>,<xref rid=""B21-brainsci-14-00624"" ref-type=""bibr"">21</xref>]. Variants in <italic toggle=""yes"">MTHFR</italic> result in lower levels of 5-MTHF, and this increases homocysteine, thereby causing a dysregulated production of monoamines [<xref rid=""B22-brainsci-14-00624"" ref-type=""bibr"">22</xref>] and changes in DNA methylation [<xref rid=""B23-brainsci-14-00624"" ref-type=""bibr"">23</xref>]. In those with severe <italic toggle=""yes"">MTHFR</italic> deficiency, 109 mutations in 171 families have been described [<xref rid=""B24-brainsci-14-00624"" ref-type=""bibr"">24</xref>]. Severe <italic toggle=""yes"">MTHFR</italic> deficiency in children is characterised by hyperhomocysteinemia, hypotonia, feeding issues, failure to thrive, lethargy, apnoea, and microcephaly [<xref rid=""B24-brainsci-14-00624"" ref-type=""bibr"">24</xref>]. These findings are important in the context of RTT, especially given that others have indicated that there may also be progressive developmental delay, epilepsy, and impaired gait in patients with severe <italic toggle=""yes"">MTHFR</italic> deficiency [<xref rid=""B25-brainsci-14-00624"" ref-type=""bibr"">25</xref>]. These symptoms are thought to be caused in part due to reduced methylation within the brain [<xref rid=""B24-brainsci-14-00624"" ref-type=""bibr"">24</xref>]. Evidence has also suggested that the <italic toggle=""yes"">MTHFR</italic> c.665C>T variant increases the susceptibility to epilepsy [<xref rid=""B26-brainsci-14-00624"" ref-type=""bibr"">26</xref>]. An adolescent/adult-onset <italic toggle=""yes"">MTHFR</italic> deficiency with a focus on epilepsy manifesting as a neuropsychiatric illness has also been identified, and shares symptom overlap with RTT [<xref rid=""B27-brainsci-14-00624"" ref-type=""bibr"">27</xref>]. This study indicated that epilepsy occurs in about half of patients with adolescent/adult-onset <italic toggle=""yes"">MTHFR</italic> deficiency, and these patients have a highly variable response to antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) [<xref rid=""B27-brainsci-14-00624"" ref-type=""bibr"">27</xref>]. A few cases have also documented <italic toggle=""yes"">MTHFR</italic> deficiency, such as in a 14-year-old girl with progressive myoclonic epilepsy [<xref rid=""B28-brainsci-14-00624"" ref-type=""bibr"">28</xref>] and in AED-induced psychosis [<xref rid=""B29-brainsci-14-00624"" ref-type=""bibr"">29</xref>]. The UK Biobank study analysed PGx variant frequency in 487,409 subjects and showed that 99.5% of subjects had at least one actionable PGx variant [<xref rid=""B30-brainsci-14-00624"" ref-type=""bibr"">30</xref>] and the Pre-emptive Pharmacogenomic Testing for Preventing Adverse Drug Reactions (PREPARE) study further demonstrated a decrease in clinically relevant ADRs using a 12 gene PGx panel [<xref rid=""B31-brainsci-14-00624"" ref-type=""bibr"">31</xref>]. This evidence implies that there is also likely to be actionable PGx findings with potential treatment implications in the RTT patient population. However, neither the frequency nor the possibility of whether <italic toggle=""yes"">MTHFR</italic> rs1801133 and rs1801131 polymorphisms are genetic modifiers of clinical severity in RTT patients have been explored. Based on (I) the similarities of symptom profiles between <italic toggle=""yes"">MTHFR</italic> deficiency and RTT, (II) parallels in <italic toggle=""yes"">MECP2</italic> and <italic toggle=""yes"">MTHFR</italic> methylation and (III) the finding that hyperhomocysteinemia over time causes irreversible neurological damage [<xref rid=""B27-brainsci-14-00624"" ref-type=""bibr"">27</xref>], it is useful to explore profiles of rs1801133 and rs1801131 polymorphisms in RTT patients. Progressive hyperhomocysteinemia would be especially important in RTT where there is already impaired methylation [<xref rid=""B3-brainsci-14-00624"" ref-type=""bibr"">3</xref>,<xref rid=""B4-brainsci-14-00624"" ref-type=""bibr"">4</xref>,<xref rid=""B32-brainsci-14-00624"" ref-type=""bibr"">32</xref>] and timely intervention would be critical to prevent further neurological decline. Preliminary reports have also suggested that hyperhomocysteinemia may itself be epileptogenic and lead to brain atrophy [<xref rid=""B33-brainsci-14-00624"" ref-type=""bibr"">33</xref>]. The overarching aim of this study was therefore to assess if <italic toggle=""yes"">MTHFR</italic> rs1801133 and rs1801131 polymorphisms are genetic modifiers of clinical severity in RTT. In this study, we thus (I) explored the frequency of <italic toggle=""yes"">MTHFR</italic> rs1801133 and rs1801131 polymorphisms in patients with RTT, (II) examined if homozygosity of these polymorphisms affects the symptom profile of RTT patients and (III) assessed if there is a relationship between these polymorphisms and AED use in patients.   Our study, for the first time, has (I) identified and reported upon the frequency of co-occurring <italic toggle=""yes"">MTHFR</italic> rs1801133 and rs1801131 genotypes in patients with RTT and (II) demonstrated that those RTT patients with the homozygous <italic toggle=""yes"">MTHFR</italic> genotype have an overall worse symptom profile when compared to non-homozygous individuals as determined by the RTT-anchored CGI-S. This suggests that in a subset of RTT patients, co-occurring <italic toggle=""yes"">MTHFR</italic> rs1801133 and rs1801131 genotypes may act as associative genetic modifiers of clinical severity. However, this finding should be tempered because homocysteine and folate levels were not reported for our sample and the phenotypical correlates of individuals with <italic toggle=""yes"">MTHFR</italic> homozygosity are therefore of an associative level rather than a certainty of findings. Our follow-up work intends to measure homocysteine and folate levels from our patient group to explore the certainty of our findings and further examine how <italic toggle=""yes"">MTHFR</italic> rs1801133 and rs1801131 genotypes may act as associative genetic modifiers of clinical severity in RTT. Notwithstanding this limitation, this is the first study that has profiled <italic toggle=""yes"">MTHFR</italic> polymorphisms and its association with symptom severity in a paediatric neurodevelopmental disorder, in this case RTT, as part of routine clinical care in a National and Specialist CAMHS in the UK. Individuals with the heterozygous or homozygous c.665C>T genotype have enzymatic activity 67–65% and 30–25% compared to the normal phenotype, respectively [<xref rid=""B12-brainsci-14-00624"" ref-type=""bibr"">12</xref>,<xref rid=""B37-brainsci-14-00624"" ref-type=""bibr"">37</xref>]. For those with c.1286A>C, the MTHFR activity is 83% and 61% for heterozygous and homozygous genotypes when compared to those with normal MTHFR activity [<xref rid=""B14-brainsci-14-00624"" ref-type=""bibr"">14</xref>]. The MTHFR c.665C>T and c.1286A>C genotypes vary across populations and depend on ethnicity [<xref rid=""B38-brainsci-14-00624"" ref-type=""bibr"">38</xref>].

This aligns with the data from the 1000 Genomes projects that showed the highest frequency of c.665C>T in Hispanics (47%), Europeans (36%) and South Asians (12%) [<xref rid=""B39-brainsci-14-00624"" ref-type=""bibr"">39</xref>,<xref rid=""B40-brainsci-14-00624"" ref-type=""bibr"">40</xref>]. In comparison, the frequency of c.1286A>C is the highest in Southeast Asians (42%) when compared to Europeans (31%) [<xref rid=""B39-brainsci-14-00624"" ref-type=""bibr"">39</xref>,<xref rid=""B40-brainsci-14-00624"" ref-type=""bibr"">40</xref>]. Other evidence has shown that the homozygosity of the c.665C>T genotype was 18%, while that of the homozygous c.1286A>C genotype was 12.5% [<xref rid=""B41-brainsci-14-00624"" ref-type=""bibr"">41</xref>]. In our total sample, 63% of the genotypes were heterozygous while 26% were homozygous. Of those showing homozygosity, 35% of the genotypes were homozygous for c.665C>T and 65% were homozygous for c.1286A>C. Caution is needed when extrapolating <italic toggle=""yes"">MTHFR</italic> rs1801133 and rs1801131 genotype frequencies from studies undertaken in other populations using neurotypical subjects [<xref rid=""B38-brainsci-14-00624"" ref-type=""bibr"">38</xref>,<xref rid=""B39-brainsci-14-00624"" ref-type=""bibr"">39</xref>,<xref rid=""B40-brainsci-14-00624"" ref-type=""bibr"">40</xref>,<xref rid=""B41-brainsci-14-00624"" ref-type=""bibr"">41</xref>] to the observed <italic toggle=""yes"">MTHFR</italic> frequencies in our sample. It has been suggested that some AEDs such as oxcarbazepine and topiramate might exacerbate <italic toggle=""yes"">MTHFR</italic> deficiency symptoms by worsening remethylation [<xref rid=""B42-brainsci-14-00624"" ref-type=""bibr"">42</xref>]. We, therefore, wanted to assess whether there is a higher frequency of AED use in the homozygous <italic toggle=""yes"">MTHFR</italic> group. Our data showed no difference in the number of AEDs used between the homozygous group compared to those in the non-homozygous <italic toggle=""yes"">MTHFR</italic> group. Both <italic toggle=""yes"">MTHFR</italic> and <italic toggle=""yes"">MECP2</italic> have a function in methylation. However, it is unknown how impaired remethylation of homocysteine to methionine caused by reduced 5-MTHF underpins the global methylation changes regulated by pathogenic <italic toggle=""yes"">MECP2</italic>. Although our current findings are at an associate level, i.e., patients with the homozygous <italic toggle=""yes"">MTHFR</italic> genotype may synergistically contribute to the phenotype of patients with RTT, it was more than two decades ago when it was first surmised that low levels of 5-MTHF in Rett patients reduce folate transport in the CNS [<xref rid=""B43-brainsci-14-00624"" ref-type=""bibr"">43</xref>]. It was shown that the levels of 5-MTHF can be normalised with improved clinical outcomes following oral folinic acid supplementation. Following that work, there is further evidence to suggest folate receptor autoimmunity exists in RTT patients [<xref rid=""B44-brainsci-14-00624"" ref-type=""bibr"">44</xref>]. Low 5-MTHF was also said to be associated with epilepsy [<xref rid=""B45-brainsci-14-00624"" ref-type=""bibr"">45</xref>]. In that study, improvements in hand stereotypies were also observed following 1 year after folinic acid supplementation [<xref rid=""B45-brainsci-14-00624"" ref-type=""bibr"">45</xref>]. However, another study that assessed 5-MTHF levels in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of 76 females with RTT showed no clinically significant changes in spinal 5-MTHF levels [<xref rid=""B46-brainsci-14-00624"" ref-type=""bibr"">46</xref>]. In young infants with severe <italic toggle=""yes"">MTHFR</italic> deficiency, early betaine treatment was suggested to prevent developmental psychomotor decline [<xref rid=""B47-brainsci-14-00624"" ref-type=""bibr"">47</xref>]. However, there have also been a few cases of brain oedema in patients with <italic toggle=""yes"">MTHFR</italic> deficiency treated with betaine [<xref rid=""B24-brainsci-14-00624"" ref-type=""bibr"">24</xref>]. Some others have suggested that folinic acid does not improve the clinical course of <italic toggle=""yes"">MTHFR</italic> deficiency [<xref rid=""B25-brainsci-14-00624"" ref-type=""bibr"">25</xref>]. When looking through the lens of neuropsychiatric disorders, folate supplements can improve clinical outcomes. A systematic review that looked at the efficacy of folate supplements in 23 studies of psychiatric disorders demonstrated that levomefolic acid or 5-methylfolate could improve clinical outcomes for patients with some psychiatric disorders [<xref rid=""B48-brainsci-14-00624"" ref-type=""bibr"">48</xref>]. However, neither betaine nor folate seem to objectively improve clinical outcomes in RTT patients, although parent-reported measures do show improvement in some clinical domains such as sleep, breathing issues, hand stereotypies, ambulation, and communication in children less than 5 years old [<xref rid=""B49-brainsci-14-00624"" ref-type=""bibr"">49</xref>]. Similarly, although folinic acid supplementation raises 5-MTHF in RTT patients, there are no significant improvements in clinical outcomes [<xref rid=""B50-brainsci-14-00624"" ref-type=""bibr"">50</xref>,<xref rid=""B51-brainsci-14-00624"" ref-type=""bibr"">51</xref>]. Further work would be needed to determine whether the MTHFR remethylation pathway is disrupted in RTT patients. However, the impaired dysregulation of methylation markers involved in the MTHFR pathway in RTT may support this notion [<xref rid=""B52-brainsci-14-00624"" ref-type=""bibr"">52</xref>]. Pre-emptive PGx testing to stratify RTT population groups for <italic toggle=""yes"">MTHFR</italic> genotypes could help to identify the appropriate patient subsets. As previously indicated, individuals with homozygotic genotypes should have their plasma methionine and plasma total homocysteine levels assessed. It would be prudent to perform these investigations as early as possible to see if there is a dysfunction of the remethylation pathway. Evidence indicates that early initiation of betaine or folate supplementation can improve neurodevelopmental outcomes in remethylation disorders [<xref rid=""B47-brainsci-14-00624"" ref-type=""bibr"">47</xref>,<xref rid=""B53-brainsci-14-00624"" ref-type=""bibr"">53</xref>,<xref rid=""B54-brainsci-14-00624"" ref-type=""bibr"">54</xref>]. Indeed, data from the European Network and Registry for Homocystinurias and Methylation Defects (E-HOD) registry demonstrated that pre-symptomatic diagnosis was a predictive factor for better neurodevelopment outcomes in patients with <italic toggle=""yes"">MTHFR</italic> deficiency [<xref rid=""B55-brainsci-14-00624"" ref-type=""bibr"">55</xref>]. Previous evidence has suggested genotype–phenotype correlations in RTT and some RTT variants are thought to have a more severe phenotype than others [<xref rid=""B56-brainsci-14-00624"" ref-type=""bibr"">56</xref>]. Clustering of RTT patients according to co-occurring <italic toggle=""yes"">MTHFR</italic> genotypes identified from PGx testing in our study did not reveal patterns concerning the prevalence of a particular type of RTT mutation. In a previous study examining the treatment of folate and betaine in RTT, although there were some differences in RTT variants between the placebo and treatment arms, there was insufficient statistical power to determine the impact of these variants [<xref rid=""B49-brainsci-14-00624"" ref-type=""bibr"">49</xref>]. In our study, the numbers are too small to examine whether a particular pathogenic RTT variant in the presence of co-occurring <italic toggle=""yes"">MTHFR</italic> polymorphism would have more impact on clinical severity. A larger sample would be required for a definitive conclusion; however, given the rare nature of RTT, it may not be possible to obtain sufficient numbers. Even in cases where genotype–phenotype relationships in RTT have been suggested, the clinical presentation can still be highly variable [<xref rid=""B57-brainsci-14-00624"" ref-type=""bibr"">57</xref>,<xref rid=""B58-brainsci-14-00624"" ref-type=""bibr"">58</xref>] and recent expert consensus guidelines for the management of RTT have also indicated that genotype–phenotype correlations in RTT are inaccurate [<xref rid=""B59-brainsci-14-00624"" ref-type=""bibr"">59</xref>]. The diagnosis of RTT is based on clinical criteria that are independent of molecular profiles [<xref rid=""B34-brainsci-14-00624"" ref-type=""bibr"">34</xref>,<xref rid=""B59-brainsci-14-00624"" ref-type=""bibr"">59</xref>]. Therefore, understanding genotype–phenotype correlations in the presence of co-occurring <italic toggle=""yes"">MTHFR</italic> polymorphism in RTT may not add value to the evidence base. It is likely that methylation would be the most modified in those with RTT and co-occurring <italic toggle=""yes"">MTHFR</italic> deficiency and this combination could have the greatest impact on neurodevelopmental outcomes (<xref rid=""brainsci-14-00624-f001"" ref-type=""fig"">Figure 1</xref>). While the phenotypical correlates of subjects with <italic toggle=""yes"">MTHFR</italic> homozygosity remain to be established, our findings do point towards an association between <italic toggle=""yes"">MTHFR</italic> rs1801133 and rs1801131 homozygosity and symptom profiles in RTT. This could be relevant for the most vulnerable patients who are at higher risk. However, homocysteine and folate levels were not measured, and therefore the findings of our study are of an associative nature. It would be interesting to investigate how these genotypes affect the concentration of homocysteine or folate levels in our sample. Age-related effects of PGx are important. Studies on paediatric PGx-guided prescribing are scarce, and three drugs (codeine, lansoprazole, and omeprazole) are suggested to have age-specific paediatric guidance [<xref rid=""B60-brainsci-14-00624"" ref-type=""bibr"">60</xref>]. Despite this, others have shown that PGx-guided treatment would be helpful for mood disorders and gastritis/esophagitis in the paediatric population [<xref rid=""B61-brainsci-14-00624"" ref-type=""bibr"">61</xref>]. Other exemplars of paediatric PGx implementation also exist [<xref rid=""B62-brainsci-14-00624"" ref-type=""bibr"">62</xref>]. As we move forward, genome-wide association studies (GWASs) could help in further confirming PGx-predisposing loci, especially in the case of <italic toggle=""yes"">MTHFR</italic> deficiency. However, only about 10% of GWASs have evaluated drug responses [<xref rid=""B63-brainsci-14-00624"" ref-type=""bibr"">63</xref>]. If there are rare variations of specific pharmacogenes, a GWAS may not have sufficient power to detect an association relevant to PGx guidance that will be clinically actionable [<xref rid=""B64-brainsci-14-00624"" ref-type=""bibr"">64</xref>]. Polygenic risk scoring might also help predict an individual’s response to medication [<xref rid=""B62-brainsci-14-00624"" ref-type=""bibr"">62</xref>]; however, in RTT, the small sample size would probably limit the ability to obtain accurate polygenic risk scores [<xref rid=""B65-brainsci-14-00624"" ref-type=""bibr"">65</xref>]. An alternative strategy would be to use pharmacoepigenomics to show how epigenetic modifications, i.e., methylation, have a role in treatment responses such as in the effectiveness of antidepressants and/or antidepressant response [<xref rid=""B66-brainsci-14-00624"" ref-type=""bibr"">66</xref>]. This strategy has shown some promise as hypomethylation in LINE-1 is suggested to be associated with poor response to risperidone in psychosis [<xref rid=""B67-brainsci-14-00624"" ref-type=""bibr"">67</xref>].",N/A,21 6 2024
24-h continuous non-invasive multiparameter home monitoring of vitals in patients with Rett syndrome by an innovative wearable technology: evidence of an overlooked chronic fatigue status,,"Rett syndrome (RTT) (OMIM #312750) is a rare X-linked neurodevelopmental disorder that mainly affects female individuals (prevalence 7.1/100,000 female patients) (<xref rid=""ref1"" ref-type=""bibr"">1</xref>, <xref rid=""ref2"" ref-type=""bibr"">2</xref>). RTT is a multisystemic disease (<xref rid=""ref3"" ref-type=""bibr"">3</xref>) caused (in over 90–95% of cases) by a <italic toggle=""yes"">de novo</italic> loss of function mutations in the methyl-CpG-binding protein 2 gene (<italic toggle=""yes"">MECP2</italic>) (<xref rid=""ref4"" ref-type=""bibr"">4</xref>). The classical clinical presentation of the disease (<xref rid=""ref1"" ref-type=""bibr"">1</xref>) is characterized by a period of 6 to 18 months of apparently normal neurodevelopment, followed by an early neurological regression, with a progressive loss of acquired cognitive, social, and motor skills in a typical 4-stage neurological regression pattern (<xref rid=""ref5"" ref-type=""bibr"">5</xref>, <xref rid=""ref6"" ref-type=""bibr"">6</xref>). RTT is a complex disease with a multifaceted clinical appearance (<xref rid=""ref3"" ref-type=""bibr"">3</xref>). Main neurological concerns are epilepsy (<xref rid=""ref7"" ref-type=""bibr"">7</xref>), transient autistic phase (<xref rid=""ref8"" ref-type=""bibr"">8</xref>), gait ataxia (<xref rid=""ref9"" ref-type=""bibr"">9</xref>), intellectual deficit (<xref rid=""ref9"" ref-type=""bibr"">9</xref>), autonomic nervous system dysfunction (ANSD) (<xref rid=""ref3"" ref-type=""bibr"">3</xref>), sleep problems (<xref rid=""ref3"" ref-type=""bibr"">3</xref>, <xref rid=""ref10"" ref-type=""bibr"">10</xref>–<xref rid=""ref12"" ref-type=""bibr"">12</xref>), abnormal movements, and behavior disturbances (<xref rid=""ref3"" ref-type=""bibr"">3</xref>). Other common comorbidities are represented by breathing dysfunction (<xref rid=""ref3"" ref-type=""bibr"">3</xref>, <xref rid=""ref13"" ref-type=""bibr"">13</xref>–<xref rid=""ref17"" ref-type=""bibr"">17</xref>), gastrointestinal (GI) problems (<xref rid=""ref3"" ref-type=""bibr"">3</xref>), scoliosis (<xref rid=""ref3"" ref-type=""bibr"">3</xref>, <xref rid=""ref18"" ref-type=""bibr"">18</xref>), and bone deficiency (osteopenia/osteoporosis with high risk of fractures) (<xref rid=""ref3"" ref-type=""bibr"">3</xref>). Autonomic nervous system dysfunction (ANSD) is a relevant contributor to some of the clinical features in RTT patients that leads to multiple impairments ranging from anxiety, GI dysfunction, breathing disturbances, peripheral vascular control alteration (<xref rid=""ref19"" ref-type=""bibr"">19</xref>) to sleep issues (<xref rid=""ref3"" ref-type=""bibr"">3</xref>), heart rate variability (HRV) (<xref rid=""ref20"" ref-type=""bibr"">20</xref>–<xref rid=""ref22"" ref-type=""bibr"">22</xref>), and increased risk of sudden death (<xref rid=""ref23"" ref-type=""bibr"">23</xref>, <xref rid=""ref24"" ref-type=""bibr"">24</xref>). Sleep pattern is severely disturbed in RTT. The prevalence of sleep disorders in these patients is reported to be approximately 80–94% (<xref rid=""ref3"" ref-type=""bibr"">3</xref>, <xref rid=""ref10"" ref-type=""bibr"">10</xref>–<xref rid=""ref12"" ref-type=""bibr"">12</xref>). Clinical manifestations such as night-time laughter, bruxism, diurnal napping, night screaming, nocturnal seizures, night terrors (<xref rid=""ref3"" ref-type=""bibr"">3</xref>, <xref rid=""ref10"" ref-type=""bibr"">10</xref>), nocturnal waking (<xref rid=""ref3"" ref-type=""bibr"">3</xref>), daytime sleepiness (<xref rid=""ref12"" ref-type=""bibr"">12</xref>), and disorders of initiating and maintaining sleep (<xref rid=""ref3"" ref-type=""bibr"">3</xref>) are frequent and linked to the patients’ age and mutation type (<xref rid=""ref3"" ref-type=""bibr"">3</xref>, <xref rid=""ref10"" ref-type=""bibr"">10</xref>). ANSD can result in cardiac abnormalities and reduced HRV in RTT patients, and varies with bradycardia (<xref rid=""ref25"" ref-type=""bibr"">25</xref>), subclinical myocarditis (<xref rid=""ref26"" ref-type=""bibr"">26</xref>), ventricular tachyarrhythmia (<xref rid=""ref27"" ref-type=""bibr"">27</xref>), prolonged QTc interval (<xref rid=""ref28"" ref-type=""bibr"">28</xref>), cardiac repolarization parameters (<xref rid=""ref28"" ref-type=""bibr"">28</xref>, <xref rid=""ref29"" ref-type=""bibr"">29</xref>), cardiorespiratory coupling measurements (<xref rid=""ref21"" ref-type=""bibr"">21</xref>, <xref rid=""ref23"" ref-type=""bibr"">23</xref>, <xref rid=""ref30"" ref-type=""bibr"">30</xref>–<xref rid=""ref32"" ref-type=""bibr"">32</xref>), and reduced HRV (<xref rid=""ref20"" ref-type=""bibr"">20</xref>–<xref rid=""ref23"" ref-type=""bibr"">23</xref>). Dysautonomia and breathing dysrhythmia may interfere with physical activity and cause poor weight gain, impacting fatigue (<xref rid=""ref3"" ref-type=""bibr"">3</xref>). A low level of tissue aerobic respiration has been reported in RTT patients exposed to exercise, thus indicating that RTT patients could get tired quicker with a lower-than-normal physical stamina compared to the control group (<xref rid=""ref33"" ref-type=""bibr"">33</xref>). Interestingly, exercise fatigue is a hallmark feature in the experimental models recapitulating RTT (<xref rid=""ref34"" ref-type=""bibr"">34</xref>, <xref rid=""ref35"" ref-type=""bibr"">35</xref>) believed to be related to peripheral MeCP2 deficiency (<xref rid=""ref36"" ref-type=""bibr"">36</xref>) and mitochondrial dysfunction (<xref rid=""ref37"" ref-type=""bibr"">37</xref>). Development of medical technology has allowed the use of wearable devices also in the healthcare field (<xref rid=""ref38"" ref-type=""bibr"">38</xref>, <xref rid=""ref39"" ref-type=""bibr"">39</xref>). HRV is used to examine the autonomic cardiac function under physiological and pathological conditions (<xref rid=""ref40"" ref-type=""bibr"">40</xref>, <xref rid=""ref41"" ref-type=""bibr"">41</xref>) and estimate fatigue (<xref rid=""ref42"" ref-type=""bibr"">42</xref>, <xref rid=""ref43"" ref-type=""bibr"">43</xref>). To date, a few studies have been carried out in RTT patients regarding the feasibility of monitoring medical vital signs in a home environment by non-invasive wearable devices during daytime and nighttime (<xref rid=""ref19"" ref-type=""bibr"">19</xref>, <xref rid=""ref44"" ref-type=""bibr"">44</xref>–<xref rid=""ref48"" ref-type=""bibr"">48</xref>). Previously, vital signs and behavioral features have been mainly evaluated by questionnaires administered to caregivers (<xref rid=""ref10"" ref-type=""bibr"">10</xref>, <xref rid=""ref11"" ref-type=""bibr"">11</xref>) or by invasive methods, such as polysomnography (PSG) (<xref rid=""ref49"" ref-type=""bibr"">49</xref>, <xref rid=""ref50"" ref-type=""bibr"">50</xref>) during hospitalization. Moreover, to the best of our knowledge, no clinical studies are found to exist evaluating longitudinal multiparameter by consistently monitoring an extensive time and/or indirectly targeting the assessment of fatigue in RTT patients. Recently, an innovative wearable technology with polymeric non-invasive sensors printed into a textile fabric has been developed, which allows a real-time monitoring of biovital and kinetic parameters with high ergonomic quality (<xref rid=""ref51"" ref-type=""bibr"">51</xref>, <xref rid=""ref52"" ref-type=""bibr"">52</xref>). This new technology, with continuous monitoring of the health status in everyday context, represents an improvement of the individual psychophysical wellbeing and health rescue purposes (<xref rid=""ref51"" ref-type=""bibr"">51</xref>, <xref rid=""ref52"" ref-type=""bibr"">52</xref>). The aim of the present study was to test the feasibility of a continuous non-invasive 24-h home monitoring of biovital parameters in RTT patients using a non-invasive, innovative wearable technology.   RTT is known to have an increased mortality risk, previously linked to cardiorespiratory issues (<xref rid=""ref24"" ref-type=""bibr"">24</xref>, <xref rid=""ref76"" ref-type=""bibr"">76</xref>) or pneumonia (<xref rid=""ref77"" ref-type=""bibr"">77</xref>). Despite the changing survival rates, due to carefully addressing modifiable risk factors (<xref rid=""ref76"" ref-type=""bibr"">76</xref>), overall clinical severity remains a key player in the mortality risk in classic RTT (<xref rid=""ref76"" ref-type=""bibr"">76</xref>, <xref rid=""ref77"" ref-type=""bibr"">77</xref>). To date, four prior studies using continuous monitoring of vital signs by different wearable sensor devices have explored variations of biovital/physiological signs and HRV metrics in RTT (<xref rid=""ref19"" ref-type=""bibr"">19</xref>, <xref rid=""ref45"" ref-type=""bibr"">45</xref>–<xref rid=""ref47"" ref-type=""bibr"">47</xref>). The present pilot study demonstrates the feasibility of a continuous 24-h in-home non-invasive biovital signs monitoring by a wearable sensor device, coupled with continuous in-home monitoring of environmental indoor variables in classic RTT patients. The percentage of correctly measured and recorded data in the absence of significant adverse events was appreciable (>70%). Apart from swimming, this innovative wearable sensor technology allowed the patients to continue their life under normal conditions and activities without restrictions. Our results are only partially in line with those of prior investigations (<xref rid=""ref45"" ref-type=""bibr"">45</xref>, <xref rid=""ref46"" ref-type=""bibr"">46</xref>) regarding age, sleep–wake cycle, <italic toggle=""yes"">MECP2</italic> gene mutation category, and clinical severity. Resting sinus tachycardia and a reduced HRV in RTT patients are currently thought to be the result of ANSD (<xref rid=""ref3"" ref-type=""bibr"">3</xref>, <xref rid=""ref19"" ref-type=""bibr"">19</xref>, <xref rid=""ref20"" ref-type=""bibr"">20</xref>, <xref rid=""ref78"" ref-type=""bibr"">78</xref>). In particular, HRV has been exploited in a novel integrated autonomic-sensory measurement approach for investigating somatosensory function (<xref rid=""ref79"" ref-type=""bibr"">79</xref>)where an abnormal HRV could improve risk stratification (<xref rid=""ref80"" ref-type=""bibr"">80</xref>). Efforts were necessary to improve the understanding of heart–brain interactions (<xref rid=""ref81"" ref-type=""bibr"">81</xref>). Influences between the heart and the brain include autonomic regulation and hemodynamic connections and HRV acting as a proxy of autonomic activity, which is associated with executive functions, decision-making, and emotional regulation (<xref rid=""ref81"" ref-type=""bibr"">81</xref>). While a high HRV is indicative of adaptability and good health, a reduced HRV variability (i.e., a decreased vagal functioning) is reported to be a sign of inadequate adaptability and physiological dysfunction (<xref rid=""ref82"" ref-type=""bibr"">82</xref>, <xref rid=""ref83"" ref-type=""bibr"">83</xref>). While technological advancements have made it possible to acquire high-quality HR and HRV data in resting conditions, several questions remain unanswered regarding the use of resting heart rate and HRV in a population and inter-individual (i.e., in response to stressors) levels (<xref rid=""ref84"" ref-type=""bibr"">84</xref>). Previous research has characterized HRV (<xref rid=""ref16"" ref-type=""bibr"">16</xref>, <xref rid=""ref20"" ref-type=""bibr"">20</xref>–<xref rid=""ref23"" ref-type=""bibr"">23</xref>, <xref rid=""ref85"" ref-type=""bibr"">85</xref>), cardiac repolarization (<xref rid=""ref28"" ref-type=""bibr"">28</xref>, <xref rid=""ref29"" ref-type=""bibr"">29</xref>), and cardiorespiratory coupling to be valuable measures of autonomic dysregulation (<xref rid=""ref21"" ref-type=""bibr"">21</xref>, <xref rid=""ref23"" ref-type=""bibr"">23</xref>, <xref rid=""ref30"" ref-type=""bibr"">30</xref>–<xref rid=""ref32"" ref-type=""bibr"">32</xref>). Dysregulation of autonomic circuits represents a key feature of RTT, possibly contributing to sudden death (<xref rid=""ref21"" ref-type=""bibr"">21</xref>, <xref rid=""ref24"" ref-type=""bibr"">24</xref>, <xref rid=""ref25"" ref-type=""bibr"">25</xref>, <xref rid=""ref27"" ref-type=""bibr"">27</xref>, <xref rid=""ref28"" ref-type=""bibr"">28</xref>, <xref rid=""ref78"" ref-type=""bibr"">78</xref>, <xref rid=""ref86"" ref-type=""bibr"">86</xref>, <xref rid=""ref87"" ref-type=""bibr"">87</xref>). Our study shows that HRV metrics (both time-domain and frequency-domain parameters) are related to age (in that pediatric patients show higher values than adolescent/adult patients with the exception of LFnu), clinical stage, and <italic toggle=""yes"">MECP2</italic> gene mutations category. Sleep–wake cycle impacted the HRV frequency-domain with a distinct pattern as a function of age. Clinical sleep disorder (CSD) was found to be related to higher values for five out of nine HRV time-domain parameters in pediatric patients, whereas no differences were observed in the adolescent/adult group. HRV frequency-domain parameters were all increased in pediatric patients with clinical sleep disorders. The pattern of the LF/HF ratio is reduced in adolescent/adult patients with clinical sleep disorders faced with increased spectral total power. The results of the present study indicate that the HRV metrics <italic toggle=""yes"">per se</italic> (i.e., the commonly used time-domain and frequency-domain indices) are unable to explain illness severity and several other features of the RTT phenotype. Overall, in the present study, highly reduced HRV values (RMSSD<20 ms) were observed in less than one-quarter of the analyzable records (data not shown). Therefore, our results would not confirm the findings of a generally reduced HRV in RTT patients as reported in at least two previous monitoring studies using wearable sensor devices (<xref rid=""ref45"" ref-type=""bibr"">45</xref>, <xref rid=""ref46"" ref-type=""bibr"">46</xref>). Several factors, including methodology differences, may likely account for this apparent discrepancy. In the present study, we can infer a persistent fatigue status, with a significant autonomic tone shift toward SNS predominance over the PSNS. To date, the pathophysiological role of <italic toggle=""yes"">MECP2</italic> gene mutations in the etiology of intrinsic cardiac abnormality and sudden death remains unclear. Several lines of evidence suggest the co-existence of intrinsic structural myocardial abnormalities in RTT patients (<xref rid=""ref88"" ref-type=""bibr"">88</xref>). In particular, it has been recently reported that cardiac repolarization abnormalities are present in RTT patients, even without long QTc, and the T-wave morphology is related to the RTT genotype, which is a predictor of mortality (<xref rid=""ref89"" ref-type=""bibr"">89</xref>). A subclinical myocardial dysfunction in RTT patients has been previously reported, where a mild-to-moderate decrease in systolic and diastolic left and right ventricles longitudinal function in both typical and atypical RTT without evidence of QT prolongation was found (<xref rid=""ref26"" ref-type=""bibr"">26</xref>). MeCP2, a reader of DNA methylation and a component of a co-repressor complex, has been shown to regulate gene expression in chronic heart failure (<xref rid=""ref90"" ref-type=""bibr"">90</xref>) and to attenuate <italic toggle=""yes"">in vitro</italic> hypoxia/reperfusion-induced injury in H9c2 cardiomyocytes by modulating the SFRP4/Wnt/β-catenin axis (<xref rid=""ref91"" ref-type=""bibr"">91</xref>). Moreover, an altered Wnt signaling, consequent to MeCP2 protein deficiency, is associated with an abnormal cardiac ion channel expression and cellular electrophysiology underlying QT prolongation and sudden death in RTT (<xref rid=""ref86"" ref-type=""bibr"">86</xref>). Severe hypotonia is a recognized feature in RTT patients and MeCP2-deficient mice. Specifically, mild generalized hypotonia is frequently observed in the first months of life in RTT patients, with an abnormal muscle tone generally observed later (<xref rid=""ref6"" ref-type=""bibr"">6</xref>). Exercise fatigue in RTT has been reported in both patients (<xref rid=""ref33"" ref-type=""bibr"">33</xref>) and experimental models recapitulating the disease (<xref rid=""ref34"" ref-type=""bibr"">34</xref>). It is postulated that the RTT phenotype is due to central and peripheral MeCP2 protein deficiency. Indeed, a comparison of peripheral knock-out (PKO) mice with wild-type and global Mecp2-deficient mice (<xref rid=""ref36"" ref-type=""bibr"">36</xref>) showed that the majority of RTT-associated behavioral, sensorimotor, gait, and autonomic (respiratory and cardiac) phenotypes are dependent on CNS deficiency; most notably, hypo-activity, exercise fatigue, and bone abnormalities have been reported to depend on peripheral Mecp2 deficiency. In particular, a disorganized architecture with hypotrophic fibers and tissue fibrosis in the skeletal muscles and altered IGF-1/Akt/mTOR pathway have been demonstrated in <italic toggle=""yes"">Mecp2</italic>-null mice (<xref rid=""ref92"" ref-type=""bibr"">92</xref>). These data suggest that hypotonia is mainly, if not exclusively, mediated by non-cell autonomous effects and support the hypothesis that defects in the paracrine/endocrine signaling system (in particular, GH/IGF axis) are the main cause of the observed muscular defects in RTT (<xref rid=""ref92"" ref-type=""bibr"">92</xref>). In the current study, besides exploiting biovital measurements and the standard HRV metrics, HR max % (maximal heart rate) and the HR/LF ratio were evaluated as potential markers of persistent fatigue and SNS activation under dynamic exercise, respectively. HR max % is an essential measure of cardiovascular compliance to exercise testing and exertion during exercise despite the commonly used equations for evaluating age-predicted HR max %, which showed poor agreement with the actual value measured by graded treadmill exercise tests in cooperating subjects (<xref rid=""ref93"" ref-type=""bibr"">93</xref>). Nonetheless, the testing of dynamical exercise in RTT patients using traditional methods is challenging, while continuous monitoring of HR and HRV metrics during a sufficiently prolonged time period (i.e., the present study) offers an alternative way to identify individually based HR max %. The present research suggests that the HR max % of RTT patients is persistently in the target ranges comparable with those observed during vigorous exercise. A persistent fatigue status, with significant autonomic tone shift toward SNS predominance over the PSNS, could be inferred from our continuous non-invasive 24-h in-home monitoring in RTT patients. In the present study, for the first time, two markers of fatigue, i.e., HR Max % (<xref rid=""ref63"" ref-type=""bibr"">63</xref>) and HR/LF (<xref rid=""ref67"" ref-type=""bibr"">67</xref>), were applied to the interpretation of the continuous biovital monitoring in our particular patient group. A comparison of RTT patients with healthy young subjects under intense exercise evidenced the relevance of the HR/LF ratio for gauging non-invasively the clinical disease severity of the disease. When the HRV-derived HR/LF ratio, previously confined to sports physiology and medicine (<xref rid=""ref67"" ref-type=""bibr"">67</xref>), was applied to the interpretation of the biovital monitoring of our examined RTT patients, it was found that several of the features of the RTT phenotype were relatable, strongly suggesting that a new point-of-view is warranted. Exercise-induced lactic threshold is the exercise intensity at which blood concentration of lactate begins to increase rapidly and is often expressed as 85% of HR max % or 75% of maximum oxygen intake (<xref rid=""ref94"" ref-type=""bibr"">94</xref>). Although exercise-induced lactic threshold has not been determined experimentally in RTT patients, evidence of systemic oxidative stress is well-established (<xref rid=""ref95"" ref-type=""bibr"">95</xref>), as well as in experimental mouse models recapitulating the disease (<xref rid=""ref96"" ref-type=""bibr"">96</xref>, <xref rid=""ref97"" ref-type=""bibr"">97</xref>). In the present study, the HR/LF ratio showed a significant relationship with subclinical hypoxia and key EEG. Epileptic seizures affect both sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous systems, thus leading to changes in the cardiac autonomic nervous function (<xref rid=""ref98"" ref-type=""bibr"">98</xref>). In addition, HRV changes in the preictal phase have been previously reported (<xref rid=""ref99"" ref-type=""bibr"">99</xref>). Among the time-domain parameters, patients with EEG multifocal epileptiform activity showed increased CVNNI, LF/HF, and total power values. Conversely, a different pattern for HRV time-domain parameters was observed in patients with EEG findings of background slowing with depressed HRV frequency-domain parameters. In our study, several parameters were found to be related to EEG findings of multifocal epileptiform activity and/or EEG background slowing, although the reasons behind the observed associations are yet to be elucidated. In the present study, patients’ contributions to the environmental water vapor [P<sub>H2O</sub> (pt)] and carbon dioxide [P<sub>CO2</sub> (pt)] partial pressures were estimated and derived from the data collected by the meteorological station. Moreover, the (heat) energy lost by the patients to maintain body temperature and the skin–environment temperature difference (measured by the smart t-shirt sensor) were calculated. Although at a very early stage, correlating these data with the environmental and some biophysical parameters brought some interesting results. Regardless, given their potential relevance, these preliminary outcomes need confirmation by future independent studies. Coherently with the limits of the present pilot investigation and considering that no definitive conclusion can be drawn at this point, here we attempted to outline a possible rationale by theoretical interpretation. The mechanism leading to heat loss and water evaporation can be explained by considering <xref rid=""EQ1"" ref-type=""disp-formula"">Eq. 1</xref> and a realistic temperature difference between the environment and the body (e.g.: <inline-formula>

</inline-formula>°C and the compensation of the latent heat of evaporation [approximately 539 Kcal/kg (2,257 kJ/kg)], resulting in heat loss from body tissues. Hence, the body–environment temperature difference drives the water evaporation from the patient’s body (her contribution to environmental humidity) and the associated heat loss. On the other hand, the patient emission of CO<sub>2</sub> certainly is related to oxygen consumption, which, in turn, is driven by physical activity (i.e., production of mechanical energy) and thermoregulation. Considering the facts above, identifying a relationship between the environmental and biophysical parameters is logical. Of course, further studies are needed to validate these new preliminary variables and to better investigate the environment–patient axis interactions and the potential use of them as new disease biomarkers. Previous research indicates that the lungs can be primarily involved in the pathophysiology of respiratory dysfunction in RTT. A possible mechanistic explanation comes from the observation of a surfactant deficiency in Mecp2-deficient mice as a consequence of a previously unrecognized lung lipid perturbation due to accumulation of neutral lipids in the lung against decreased surfactant phospholipids (<xref rid=""ref100"" ref-type=""bibr"">100</xref>). potentially contributing Intriguingly, surfactant dysfunction causes ground glass opacities and bronchial thickening, which is comparable with the computed tomography observation in RTT patient lungs (<xref rid=""ref14"" ref-type=""bibr"">14</xref>). However, the role of changes in P<sub>H2O</sub> (pt) in the RTT severity and progression should be considered in the study and certainly worthwhile for further investigation. It is known that water evaporation is mainly driven by temperature differences and the difference between body and environment temperature could play a central role in the explanation of our findings. Of course, further studies are needed to validate these new preliminary variables and better investigate the environment–patient interactions and the potential use of them as new disease biomarkers. Continuous monitoring of vital signs has potential value in the diagnosis and/or rescue of critically ill patients (<xref rid=""ref101"" ref-type=""bibr"">101</xref>). In parallel with the technology of wearable wireless sensors for vital signs monitoring, the use of quantitative data and mathematical models to understand and treat disease is advancing rapidly. Future studies are needed to address the possible role of the identified environmental variables and deepen the present investigation by complementing the results with a multicentric case–control design, complimentary polysomnography and kinetic analyses, and interfacing the biochemical correlates of the 24-h continuous non-invasive multiparameter home monitoring in RTT patients.

Potentiation of the muscarinic acetylcholine receptor 1 modulates neurophysiological features in a mouse model of Rett syndrome,"Rett syndrome (RTT) is a neurodevelopmental disorder primarily caused by mutations in the X chromosome-linked gene <italic toggle=""yes"">Methyl-CpG Binding Protein 2</italic> (<italic toggle=""yes"">MECP2</italic>). Restoring MeCP2 expression after disease onset in a mouse model of RTT reverses phenotypes, providing hope for development of treatments for RTT. Translatable biomarkers of improvement and treatment responses have the potential to accelerate both preclinical and clinical evaluation of targeted therapies in RTT. Studies in people with and mouse models of RTT have identified neurophysiological features, such as auditory event-related potentials, that correlate with disease severity, suggesting that they could be useful as biomarkers of disease improvement or early treatment response. We recently demonstrated that treatment of RTT mice with a positive allosteric modulator (PAM) of muscarinic acetylcholine subtype 1 receptor (M<sub>1</sub>) improved phenotypes, suggesting that modulation of M<sub>1</sub> activity is a potential therapy in RTT. To evaluate whether neurophysiological features could be useful biomarkers to assess the effects of M<sub>1</sub> PAM treatment, we acutely administered the M<sub>1</sub> PAM VU0486846 (VU846) at doses of 1, 3, 10 and 30 ​mg/kg in wildtype and RTT mice. This resulted in an inverted U-shaped dose response with maximal improvement of AEP features at 3 ​mg/kg but with no marked effect on basal EEG power or epileptiform discharges in RTT mice and no significant changes in wildtype mice. These findings suggest that M<sub>1</sub> potentiation can improve neural circuit synchrony to auditory stimuli in RTT mice and that neurophysiological features have potential as pharmacodynamic or treatment-responsive biomarkers for preclinical and clinical evaluation of putative therapies in RTT.","Rett syndrome (RTT) is a neurodevelopmental disorder (NDD) that predominantly affects girls and women and is characterized by loss of hand skills and spoken language, repetitive hand movements, and gait problems [<xref rid=""bib1"" ref-type=""bibr"">1</xref>].

Interestingly, similar neurophysiological features have been found to correlate with phenotypic abnormalities in RTT mouse models [<xref rid=""bib13"" ref-type=""bibr"">13</xref>,<xref rid=""bib38"" ref-type=""bibr"">[38]</xref>, <xref rid=""bib39"" ref-type=""bibr"">[39]</xref>, <xref rid=""bib40"" ref-type=""bibr"">[40]</xref>], and can be normalized in mice expressing a partial loss-of-function (LOF) allele of MeCP2 by increasing expression of the partial LOF MeCP2 variant [<xref rid=""bib40"" ref-type=""bibr"">40</xref>], suggesting that these neurophysiological features may serve as translatable biomarkers of disease progression and improvement. Here, we characterized changes in neurophysiological features in a RTT mouse model after acute treatment with a positive allosteric modulator (PAM) targeting muscarinic acetylcholine receptor activity (mAChRs). Alterations in the expression of various mAChRs have been seen in human RTT brain autopsy samples and in animal models with RTT syndrome [<xref rid=""bib41"" ref-type=""bibr"">[41]</xref>, <xref rid=""bib42"" ref-type=""bibr"">[42]</xref>, <xref rid=""bib43"" ref-type=""bibr"">[43]</xref>, <xref rid=""bib44"" ref-type=""bibr"">[44]</xref>, <xref rid=""bib45"" ref-type=""bibr"">[45]</xref>]. Selective removal of MeCP2 function from cholinergic neurons in mice causes phenotypic and physiological abnormalities that are similar to those seen in RTT mouse models lacking MeCP2 protein expression [<xref rid=""bib46"" ref-type=""bibr"">[46]</xref>, <xref rid=""bib47"" ref-type=""bibr"">[47]</xref>, <xref rid=""bib48"" ref-type=""bibr"">[48]</xref>]. Treatment with compounds that increase cholinergic tone or selective restoration of MeCP2 function in cholinergic neurons improves phenotypes in RTT model animals [<xref rid=""bib46"" ref-type=""bibr"">[46]</xref>, <xref rid=""bib47"" ref-type=""bibr"">[47]</xref>, <xref rid=""bib48"" ref-type=""bibr"">[48]</xref>, <xref rid=""bib49"" ref-type=""bibr"">[49]</xref>, <xref rid=""bib50"" ref-type=""bibr"">[50]</xref>]. Further, mRNA levels of the M<sub>1</sub>, M<sub>2</sub>, M<sub>3</sub> and M<sub>5</sub> mAChR subtypes were significantly decreased in cortical autopsy samples from people with RTT relative to unaffected cortical samples; however, only M<sub>1</sub> expression demonstrated a linear relationship with MeCP2 expression [<xref rid=""bib44"" ref-type=""bibr"">44</xref>,<xref rid=""bib45"" ref-type=""bibr"">45</xref>]. Additionally, similar decreases in M<sub>1</sub> expression were also found in <italic toggle=""yes"">Mecp2</italic><sup><italic toggle=""yes"">+/−</italic></sup> mice, and treatment of these animals with an M<sub>1</sub> positive allosteric modulator (PAM), VU0453595, corrected deficits in social preference, spatial memory, associative memory deficits, and apneas [<xref rid=""bib45"" ref-type=""bibr"">45</xref>]. In the present study, we evaluated changes to neurophysiological features after acute administration of an M<sub>1</sub> PAM, VU0486846 (VU846), to <italic toggle=""yes"">Mecp2</italic><sup><italic toggle=""yes"">+/−</italic></sup> mice; we have shown this compound to be a highly selective ligand for M<sub>1</sub> receptors that exhibits robust pro-cognitive efficacy in animal models without cholinergic adverse effects and has a pharmacokinetic profile suitable for chronic dosing [<xref rid=""bib51"" ref-type=""bibr"">51</xref>,<xref rid=""bib52"" ref-type=""bibr"">52</xref>]. In the current study, we show that acute treatment with VU846 across a dose range from 1 to 30 ​mg/kg results in an inverted U-shaped dose-response relationship with the most robust improvement in auditory event-related potential (ERP) (also known as auditory evoked potential [AEP]) features at 3 ​mg/kg. These results point to the potential for translatable neurophysiological features such as AEP to be useful in preclinical as well as early-stage clinical studies to conduct dose-finding experiments and validate treatment options.  To assess the effect of acute M<sub>1</sub> PAM administration on neurophysiological features, vehicle and VU846 (1, 3, 10 and 30 ​mg/kg) were administered in a randomized manner to <italic toggle=""yes"">Mecp2</italic><sup><italic toggle=""yes"">+/−</italic></sup> (MUT) and wildtype (WT) littermate female mice. This dose range of VU846 was chosen based on previous work which demonstrated that 10 ​mg/kg VU846 treatment reversed risperidone-induced deficits in contextual fear conditioning, with a minimal effective dose of 1 ​mg/kg and a moderate effect at 3 ​mg/kg [<xref rid=""bib51"" ref-type=""bibr"">51</xref>]. We observed significant effects on various AEP parameters with the 3 ​mg/kg dose of VU846; to demonstrate VU846's effect on each neurophysiological feature, the data for this dose are presented first. We then used the same analysis to evaluate the drug's dose-response. Recent studies in people with RTT and animal models of RTT have demonstrated consistent changes of neurophysiological features that correlate with age and clinical/phenotypic severity, suggesting the potential for these neurophysiological measures to serve as biomarkers of clinical progression [<xref rid=""bib36"" ref-type=""bibr"">[36]</xref>, <xref rid=""bib37"" ref-type=""bibr"">[37]</xref>, <xref rid=""bib38"" ref-type=""bibr"">[38]</xref>, <xref rid=""bib39"" ref-type=""bibr"">[39]</xref>,<xref rid=""bib60"" ref-type=""bibr"">[60]</xref>, <xref rid=""bib61"" ref-type=""bibr"">[61]</xref>, <xref rid=""bib62"" ref-type=""bibr"">[62]</xref>, <xref rid=""bib63"" ref-type=""bibr"">[63]</xref>, <xref rid=""bib64"" ref-type=""bibr"">[64]</xref>]. However, it has not been determined if these neurophysiological features have the potential to serve as treatment-responsive biomarkers. In this study, we found that VU846, a PAM targeting the M<sub>1</sub> mAChR, improved neurophysiological features by increasing AEP peak amplitudes, enhancing auditory evoked power, and increasing stimulus-driven neuronal synchronous activity as seen by improvement of the AEP waveform and increased inter-trial phase coherence. By evaluating the dose-dependent response, we found that VU846 treatment showed an inverted dose-response effect on these AEP features with a narrow effective dose range. Additionally, VU846 treatment across a range of doses had no marked effect on basal EEG power or the frequency of epileptiform discharges. These results suggest that neurophysiological features such as AEP could serve as biomarkers to evaluate early treatment response and pharmacodynamic dose finding in preclinical trials. The inverted U-shaped response of M<sub>1</sub> PAM VU846 on AEP in RTT mice suggests a narrow dose range for efficacy in this outcome measure. We previously reported the activity of a 10 ​mg/kg dose of another M<sub>1</sub> PAM, VU0453595, which effectively rescued social preference, spatial memory, and associative memory deficits in RTT mice [<xref rid=""bib45"" ref-type=""bibr"">45</xref>]; however, dose-response experiments were not performed. Our studies here were based on the development of VU846 as an improved M<sub>1</sub> PAM with enhanced potency and pharmacokinetics compared to VU0453595 [<xref rid=""bib51"" ref-type=""bibr"">51</xref>,<xref rid=""bib65"" ref-type=""bibr"">65</xref>] as well as studies showing that acute administration of VU846 dose-dependently enhanced recognition memory in naive rats and reversed risperidone-induced deficits in acquisition of contextual fear conditioning with minimum effective dose of 3 ​mg/kg with no inverted U response observed [<xref rid=""bib51"" ref-type=""bibr"">51</xref>]. Based on these findings, there appears to be a disconnect between behavioral efficacy and changes in AEP that will require cross validation of multiple M<sub>1</sub> PAMs in dose-response format in both behavior and EEG/AEP evaluation in RTT mice. Interestingly, chronic dosing of 10 ​mg/kg VU846 in either an Alzheimer's or a prion disease model for several weeks resulted in efficacy in reversing cognitive deficits as well as benefits in neuronal survival and amyloid processing with no loss of efficacy over time [<xref rid=""bib52"" ref-type=""bibr"">52</xref>,<xref rid=""bib66"" ref-type=""bibr"">66</xref>,<xref rid=""bib67"" ref-type=""bibr"">67</xref>]. This suggests that chronic dosing of VU846 may induce differential efficacy compared to acute administration; as VU846 has been optimized for use in chronic dosing paradigms, these could form the basis of future studies. We would note, however, that a similar inverted U-shaped dose response in RTT mice was reported in our study of the of M<sub>4</sub> PAM VU0467154 (VU154), which rescued anxiety, social preference, associative memory, and respiratory phenotypes in RTT mice after several weeks of dosing, but benefit was seen only with 3 ​mg/kg but not with 1 or 10 ​mg/kg doses [<xref rid=""bib44"" ref-type=""bibr"">44</xref>,<xref rid=""bib68"" ref-type=""bibr"">68</xref>]. Based on our findings, future studies evaluating compound behavior on both behavior and AEPs with RTT mice using dose-response and chronic dosing studies would be informative in positioning AEPs as a biomarker for muscarinic mechanisms. Regardless, the studies here show that effects on AEPs are detected in RTT mice, suggesting that they have the potential to serve as translatable biomarkers for dose-finding and treatment outcomes in the clinic. In general, the effects of PAMs are often subtle based on their mechanism of action. However, it is not unexpected to observe a more robust effect in a disease model with reduced expression of the receptors being targeted by the PAM, as seen here with the RTT mouse model. Experiments of VU846 in slices from WT mice examining the prefrontal cortex (PFC) layer V or the ventral hippocampal-PFC synapse in the prefrontal cortex from WT mice showed that the compound did not induce LTD when applied alone; however, it potentiated the LTD induced by mAChR agonists [<xref rid=""bib51"" ref-type=""bibr"">51</xref>]. In contrast, in vivo treatment of naïve WT rats with VU846 showed a dose-dependent improvement in novel object recognition, with minimal effect at 3 ​mg/kg [<xref rid=""bib51"" ref-type=""bibr"">51</xref>], but no effect on contextual fear conditioning. In the current study, we did observe an effect of VU846 on neurophysiological features in WT mice, with decreased ESRP >20 ​Hz in the time window of 100–240 ​ms following the stimulation after 3 ​mg/kg treatment (<xref rid=""fig2"" ref-type=""fig"">Fig. 2</xref>B, top right panel, red dotted area), and decreased basal EEG beta band power after 1 ​mg/kg treatment. However, we did not observe the same dramatic changes in the AEP in WT mice as we did in RTT mice. We hypothesize that this difference reflects potentially altered sensitivity to an M<sub>1</sub> PAM in RTT mice due to decreased M1 receptor expression in this disease context. These results suggest a potentially important pathophysiological change in RTT mice and provide guidance for future mechanistic exploration of the underlying neurocircuitry. Previous studies have observed that abnormalities in the cholinergic system in RTT and increasing cholinergic tone in RTT animal models improved phenotypic responses [<xref rid=""bib41"" ref-type=""bibr"">[41]</xref>, <xref rid=""bib42"" ref-type=""bibr"">[42]</xref>, <xref rid=""bib43"" ref-type=""bibr"">[43]</xref>, <xref rid=""bib44"" ref-type=""bibr"">[44]</xref>, <xref rid=""bib45"" ref-type=""bibr"">[45]</xref>,<xref rid=""bib69"" ref-type=""bibr"">69</xref>,<xref rid=""bib70"" ref-type=""bibr"">70</xref>]. We predict that improvements in AEP features in RTT mice after VU846 treatment are due to potentiating cholinergic tone. Studies in people or animals (not with RTT) also have shown that altering cholinergic tone affects AEP [<xref rid=""bib71"" ref-type=""bibr"">71</xref>,<xref rid=""bib72"" ref-type=""bibr"">72</xref>]. For examples, treatment with rivastigmine, a cholinesterase inhibitor, enhances AEP features and this effect is blocked by an mAChR antagonists [<xref rid=""bib71"" ref-type=""bibr"">71</xref>,<xref rid=""bib73"" ref-type=""bibr"">73</xref>]. Additionally, a study on vagal nerve stimulation (VNS) demonstrated that increased cholinergic tone enhances <funding-source id=""gs3""><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type=""doi"">10.13039/100011745</institution-id><institution>AEP</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source> evoked in the primary auditory cortex (A1) [<xref rid=""bib74"" ref-type=""bibr"">74</xref>], further supporting the relationship between cholinergic signaling and <funding-source id=""gs4""><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type=""doi"">10.13039/100011745</institution-id><institution>AEP</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source> responses. Interestingly, cortical recordings found that the VNS-induced strengthening of the AEP response was observed in the superficial, but not the deep, cortical A1 layer. This cortical layer-specific response was proposed by the authors to be due to differences in cortical laminar ACh innervation, with increased ACh nerve terminal density in superficial compared to deep cortical layers [<xref rid=""bib75"" ref-type=""bibr"">75</xref>]. Further, VNS-induced modulation of EEG oscillatory activity was more robustly observed in stimulus-evoked conditions compared to resting state [<xref rid=""bib76"" ref-type=""bibr"">[76]</xref>, <xref rid=""bib77"" ref-type=""bibr"">[77]</xref>, <xref rid=""bib78"" ref-type=""bibr"">[78]</xref>], consistent with our results showing that VU846 treatment did not alter the basal EEG power but increased auditory event-related power in RTT mice. Finally, VNS treatment decreased auditory stimulus-specific adaptation only with repeated stimuli [<xref rid=""bib74"" ref-type=""bibr"">74</xref>]. All of these findings suggest that VNS treatment affects sensory gain control [<xref rid=""bib74"" ref-type=""bibr"">74</xref>], and that the modulation of cholinergic tone might be related to basal cholinergic activity, providing insight to the observed inverted U-shaped VU846 dose-response on AEP observed here. Event-related potentials (ERPs), such as AEPs, are thought to reflect the synchronized firing of similarly oriented cortical pyramidal neurons during information processing elicited by a variety of sensory, cognitive or motor events [<xref rid=""bib79"" ref-type=""bibr"">79</xref>,<xref rid=""bib80"" ref-type=""bibr"">80</xref>]. Changes in EPR could reflect variation of neural network activity, capability of neuronal crosstalk, or alterations in the local excitatory/inhibitory (E/I) balance [<xref rid=""bib58"" ref-type=""bibr"">58</xref>,<xref rid=""bib81"" ref-type=""bibr"">[81]</xref>, <xref rid=""bib82"" ref-type=""bibr"">[82]</xref>, <xref rid=""bib83"" ref-type=""bibr"">[83]</xref>]. Previous studies have shown that variation of local neurocircuit E/I balance alters AEPs evoked in RTT animal models [<xref rid=""bib58"" ref-type=""bibr"">58</xref>]. In this study, we found that treatment with 3 ​mg/kg VU846 increased both AEP peak amplitudes and enhanced stimulus-driven neuronal synchronous activity, reflected by normalization of P2 latency, increased P2 rising and decay slope, decreased AEP waveform variation, and increased inter-trial phase coherence in RTT mice. Thus, it is possible that the improvement of VU846 on neural network synchronous activity occurs by its modulation of the local neurocircuit cholinergic tone that then influences network E/I balance. Interestingly, VNS paired with sound stimulation in a rat model of RTT improved cortical A1 sound stimulus response and synchrony [<xref rid=""bib84"" ref-type=""bibr"">84</xref>]. The effects of VNS on AEPs are thought to involve the modulation of sensory gain to enhance cortical output via a feedforward mechanism [<xref rid=""bib74"" ref-type=""bibr"">74</xref>,<xref rid=""bib85"" ref-type=""bibr"">85</xref>]. Thus, we hypothesize that a similar mechanism underlies the improvement of AEP by VU846 in RTT mice, in which VU846 treatment may shift the E/I balance within feedforward neurocircuitry in auditory processing pathways and result in the enhancement of auditory evoked responses [<xref rid=""bib77"" ref-type=""bibr"">77</xref>,<xref rid=""bib86"" ref-type=""bibr"">[86]</xref>, <xref rid=""bib87"" ref-type=""bibr"">[87]</xref>, <xref rid=""bib88"" ref-type=""bibr"">[88]</xref>]. Excitingly, Adcock et al. demonstrated that VNS treatment of a RTT rat model improved cortical response strength to sounds, supporting the concept that VNS treatment increased the auditory stimulus induced neural response and information [<xref rid=""bib84"" ref-type=""bibr"">84</xref>]. Combined with previously observed effects of VNS on AEP, the connection of these effects to cholinergic signaling, and the role of modulating cholinergic tone in RTT to improve both AEP features and phenotypic abnormalities points to the therapeutic potential of cholinergic modulation in people with RTT. Importantly, positive modulation of M<sub>1</sub> cholinergic tone via VU846 did not increase epileptic discharges in RTT mice, which is important given the high incidence of seizures in people with RTT and previous work showing that PAMs with agonist activity at M<sub>1</sub> can induce seizures [<xref rid=""bib51"" ref-type=""bibr"">51</xref>,<xref rid=""bib89"" ref-type=""bibr"">[89]</xref>, <xref rid=""bib90"" ref-type=""bibr"">[90]</xref>, <xref rid=""bib91"" ref-type=""bibr"">[91]</xref>]. Future work is needed to further evaluate the effects of sub-acute or chronic dosing of VU846 on neurophysiological responses and phenotypic improvement to validate the utility of these neurophysiological features as biomarkers of treatment response. Furthermore, these findings provide both insight into and experimental approaches to characterize neural circuit level pathophysiological mechanisms in RTT related to cortical processing of sensory stimuli and the role of the cholinergic system in modulating cortical responses.

Modulation of Brain Cholesterol Metabolism through CYP46A1 Overexpression for Rett Syndrome,"Rett syndrome (RTT) is a rare neurodevelopmental disorder caused by mutation in the X-linked gene methyl-CpG-binding protein 2 (Mecp2), a ubiquitously expressed transcriptional regulator. RTT results in mental retardation and developmental regression that affects approximately 1 in 10,000 females. Currently, there is no curative treatment for RTT. Thus, it is crucial to develop new therapeutic approaches for children suffering from RTT. Several studies suggested that RTT is linked with defects in cholesterol homeostasis, but for the first time, therapeutic evaluation is carried out by modulating this pathway. Moreover, AAV-based CYP46A1 overexpression, the enzyme involved in cholesterol pathway, has been demonstrated to be efficient in several neurodegenerative diseases. Based on these data, we strongly believe that CYP46A1 could be a relevant therapeutic target for RTT. Herein, we evaluated the effects of intravenous AAVPHP.eB-hCYP46A1-HA delivery in male and female <italic toggle=""yes"">Mecp2</italic>-deficient mice. The applied AAVPHP.eB-hCYP46A1 transduced essential neurons of the central nervous system (CNS). CYP46A1 overexpression alleviates behavioral alterations in both male and female <italic toggle=""yes"">Mecp2 knockout</italic> mice and extends the lifespan in <italic toggle=""yes"">Mecp2-deficient</italic> males. Several parameters related to cholesterol pathway are improved and correction of mitochondrial activity is demonstrated in treated mice, which highlighted the clear therapeutic benefit of CYP46A1 through the neuroprotection effect. IV delivery of AAVPHP.eB-CYP46A1 is perfectly well tolerated with no inflammation observed in the CNS of the treated mice. Altogether, our results strongly suggest that CYP46A1 is a relevant target and overexpression could alleviate the phenotype of Rett patients.","Rett syndrome (RTT; OMIM identifier #312750) is a rare neurodevelopmental disorder caused primarily by mutations of the X-linked <italic toggle=""yes"">Mecp2</italic> gene, encoding the transcriptional regulator methyl-CpG-binding protein 2 (Mecp2) [<xref rid=""B1-pharmaceutics-16-00756"" ref-type=""bibr"">1</xref>]. Less common RTT cases are caused by mutations of the genes encoding cyclin-dependent kinase-like 5 (<italic toggle=""yes"">CDKL5</italic>) and forkhead box protein G1 (<italic toggle=""yes"">FOXG1</italic>) [<xref rid=""B2-pharmaceutics-16-00756"" ref-type=""bibr"">2</xref>,<xref rid=""B3-pharmaceutics-16-00756"" ref-type=""bibr"">3</xref>]. RTT predominantly affects females, with a prevalence of 1 case in 10,000 female births. RTT male patients rarely survive longer than infancy. Female patients display normal growth and development for the first 6–16 months of their life, followed by developmental stagnation and regression, characterized by severe language, communication, and learning impairment; coordination and breathing problems; and other brain functions being affected [<xref rid=""B4-pharmaceutics-16-00756"" ref-type=""bibr"">4</xref>,<xref rid=""B5-pharmaceutics-16-00756"" ref-type=""bibr"">5</xref>]. The Mecp2 protein is expressed widely throughout the body but at particularly high levels in post-mitotic central nervous system (CNS) neurons [<xref rid=""B6-pharmaceutics-16-00756"" ref-type=""bibr"">6</xref>,<xref rid=""B7-pharmaceutics-16-00756"" ref-type=""bibr"">7</xref>], hence its fundamental role in brain development, maturation, and neuronal function. At present, there is no curative treatment for RTT. The molecules that are currently used only aim at decreasing the secondary effects associated with RTT. Very recently, in March 2023, a new oral therapy, DAYBUE™ (trofinetide), was marketed for the treatment of RTT in adults and children of 2 years of age and older in the United States. This is the first and only treatment approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) specifically indicated for RTT [<xref rid=""B8-pharmaceutics-16-00756"" ref-type=""bibr"">8</xref>]. The phase 3 study of trofinetide demonstrated drug efficacy in some individuals with RTT (NCT04181723 [<xref rid=""B9-pharmaceutics-16-00756"" ref-type=""bibr"">9</xref>]). It is therefore crucial to develop new therapeutic approaches for children suffering from RTT. Currently, the therapeutic strategies are either (1) targeting the downstream cellular pathways and circuits disrupted by Mecp2 deficiency or (2) gene therapy approaches that directly target the <italic toggle=""yes"">Mecp2</italic> gene [<xref rid=""B10-pharmaceutics-16-00756"" ref-type=""bibr"">10</xref>]. Gene therapy or the introduction of a healthy copy of Mecp2 into the brain represents the only potential treatment that could address the root causes of RTT. Nevertheless, it remains a challenge for researchers to restore Mecp2 activity in unhealthy cells while avoiding a Mecp2 duplication-like phenotype as well as to achieve sufficient levels of transduction efficiency with widespread delivery throughout the brain [<xref rid=""B10-pharmaceutics-16-00756"" ref-type=""bibr"">10</xref>]. Several studies suggest that RTT is linked to a dysregulation of cholesterol metabolism [<xref rid=""B11-pharmaceutics-16-00756"" ref-type=""bibr"">11</xref>]. Indeed, the analysis of serum samples of RTT patients revealed abnormal lipid parameters such as elevated cholesterol, HDL, and LDL levels. In addition, scavenger receptor B class 1 (SR-B1), a protein responsible for the uptake of cholesteryl esters from HDL and LDL particles, was found to be reduced in RTT patients’ fibroblasts [<xref rid=""B12-pharmaceutics-16-00756"" ref-type=""bibr"">12</xref>], suggesting a link between lipid homeostasis and Mecp2 function [<xref rid=""B13-pharmaceutics-16-00756"" ref-type=""bibr"">13</xref>]. Moreover, a recent study showed that the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) lipidomics profile was altered in RTT patients. The authors suggest that profiling lipidomics in RTT could serve as a biomarker for RTT diagnosis [<xref rid=""B14-pharmaceutics-16-00756"" ref-type=""bibr"">14</xref>]. Similarly, Mecp2-null mice display perturbed lipid homeostasis, including high serum triglyceride and cholesterol levels, as well as elevated cholesterol in whole-brain homogenates [<xref rid=""B15-pharmaceutics-16-00756"" ref-type=""bibr"">15</xref>,<xref rid=""B16-pharmaceutics-16-00756"" ref-type=""bibr"">16</xref>,<xref rid=""B17-pharmaceutics-16-00756"" ref-type=""bibr"">17</xref>]. Further, Buchovecky et al. showed that nonsense mutations in squalene epoxidase, one of the rate-limiting enzymes in cholesterol biosynthesis, as well as statin treatment rescue disrupted lipid metabolism and improve symptoms in Mecp2-null mice [<xref rid=""B15-pharmaceutics-16-00756"" ref-type=""bibr"">15</xref>]. These findings suggest that a mevalonate/cholesterol synthesis pathway could be a valid therapeutic target.  Cholesterol is a major lipid component of brain cell membranes, accounting for 20% of the body’s total cholesterol content. It plays a crucial role in brain development, synaptogenesis, neuronal activity, neuron survival, learning, and memory. Cholesterol does not freely cross the blood–brain barrier (BBB), and nearly all cholesterol in the adult brain is synthesized in situ by astrocytes [<xref rid=""B18-pharmaceutics-16-00756"" ref-type=""bibr"">18</xref>,<xref rid=""B19-pharmaceutics-16-00756"" ref-type=""bibr"">19</xref>]. The cholesterol abundance in the CNS depends primarily on local synthesis and efflux. However, cholesterol cannot be exported directly from the brain. It is converted to 24(S)-hydroxycholesterol (24-OHC) by cholesterol 24-hydroxylase (encoded by CYP46A1 gene), a highly conserved cytochrome P450 enzyme, which is able to cross the BBB and enter the circulation to the liver to be further metabolized to bile acids [<xref rid=""B20-pharmaceutics-16-00756"" ref-type=""bibr"">20</xref>,<xref rid=""B21-pharmaceutics-16-00756"" ref-type=""bibr"">21</xref>,<xref rid=""B22-pharmaceutics-16-00756"" ref-type=""bibr"">22</xref>]. Consequently, brain cholesterol content is determined by the balance between the pathways of in situ biosynthesis and cholesterol elimination via 24-hydroxylation catalyzed by CYP46A1. Indeed, cholesterol imbalance is associated with several neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer’s disease (AD), Huntington’s disease (HD), Parkinson’s disease (PD), and Niemann–Pick type C disease [<xref rid=""B18-pharmaceutics-16-00756"" ref-type=""bibr"">18</xref>,<xref rid=""B23-pharmaceutics-16-00756"" ref-type=""bibr"">23</xref>,<xref rid=""B24-pharmaceutics-16-00756"" ref-type=""bibr"">24</xref>,<xref rid=""B25-pharmaceutics-16-00756"" ref-type=""bibr"">25</xref>,<xref rid=""B26-pharmaceutics-16-00756"" ref-type=""bibr"">26</xref>,<xref rid=""B27-pharmaceutics-16-00756"" ref-type=""bibr"">27</xref>]. Studies showed that the modulation of CYP46A1 activity by gene therapy or pharmacologic means could be beneficial in the case of neurodegenerative and other brain diseases [<xref rid=""B28-pharmaceutics-16-00756"" ref-type=""bibr"">28</xref>]. For example, the neuronal overexpression of CYP46A1 by the injection of the adeno-associated virus (AAV) vector before or after the onset of amyloid plaque significantly reduces Aβ pathology in the mouse model of AD [<xref rid=""B29-pharmaceutics-16-00756"" ref-type=""bibr"">29</xref>]. Likewise, AAVrh.10-CYP46A1 delivery in the striatum of HD mice protects them from motor pathology and neuropathological alterations [<xref rid=""B30-pharmaceutics-16-00756"" ref-type=""bibr"">30</xref>] and is actually under clinical evaluation (NCT05541627). It has been reported that <italic toggle=""yes"">CYP46A1</italic> expression increased by 38% over wild-type levels in <italic toggle=""yes"">Mecp2</italic>-deficient males aged up to 28 days (when mice display mild symptoms), indicating a heightened need for cholesterol turnover in neurons. Its expression was downregulated when the mutant males were severely symptomatic (aged 56 days) [<xref rid=""B15-pharmaceutics-16-00756"" ref-type=""bibr"">15</xref>,<xref rid=""B16-pharmaceutics-16-00756"" ref-type=""bibr"">16</xref>].  Based on the studies reported above indicating abnormal cholesterol metabolism in Rett models [<xref rid=""B16-pharmaceutics-16-00756"" ref-type=""bibr"">16</xref>,<xref rid=""B31-pharmaceutics-16-00756"" ref-type=""bibr"">31</xref>,<xref rid=""B32-pharmaceutics-16-00756"" ref-type=""bibr"">32</xref>] and the important role of cholesterol in the neurodegenerative process of several diseases [<xref rid=""B18-pharmaceutics-16-00756"" ref-type=""bibr"">18</xref>,<xref rid=""B23-pharmaceutics-16-00756"" ref-type=""bibr"">23</xref>,<xref rid=""B24-pharmaceutics-16-00756"" ref-type=""bibr"">24</xref>,<xref rid=""B25-pharmaceutics-16-00756"" ref-type=""bibr"">25</xref>,<xref rid=""B26-pharmaceutics-16-00756"" ref-type=""bibr"">26</xref>,<xref rid=""B27-pharmaceutics-16-00756"" ref-type=""bibr"">27</xref>], we strongly believe that CYP46A1 could be a relevant therapeutic target for Rett disorder. Our goal was to investigate the restoration of neuronal cholesterol metabolism through the overexpression of CYP46A1 as a therapeutic option for Rett patients in mouse model KO Mecp2<sup>tm1Bird</sup>.  To efficiently overexpress CYP46A1, we need to largely transduce the brain of <italic toggle=""yes"">Mecp2</italic>-deficient animals; for that purpose, we want to use a new serotype of AAVPHP.eB. The latter was described as strongly efficient to cross the BBB after intravenous delivery and lead to an efficient brain and spinal cord transduction in mouse models [<xref rid=""B33-pharmaceutics-16-00756"" ref-type=""bibr"">33</xref>]. In this study, we evaluated the effects of the intravenous administration of AAVPHP.eB-hCYP46A1-HA vector in male and female <italic toggle=""yes"">Mecp</italic>2-deficient mice before the onset of symptoms—i.e., 21 days in males or 12 weeks in females.    We proposed the intravenous administration of AAV-PHP.eB before the onset of symptoms (i.e., 21 days in males or 12 weeks in females) as a treatment for RTT. AAVPHP.eB can cross the BBB efficiently compared to AAV9 and can transduce CNS neurons well [<xref rid=""B33-pharmaceutics-16-00756"" ref-type=""bibr"">33</xref>,<xref rid=""B39-pharmaceutics-16-00756"" ref-type=""bibr"">39</xref>]. In agreement with the literature and our previous studies [<xref rid=""B40-pharmaceutics-16-00756"" ref-type=""bibr"">40</xref>,<xref rid=""B41-pharmaceutics-16-00756"" ref-type=""bibr"">41</xref>], we demonstrated broad neuronal transduction in the CNS without major peripheral load of the AAV (especially in the liver and heart), which could lead to toxicity; this is a crucial advantage compared to intravenous AAV9 delivery at similar doses [<xref rid=""B42-pharmaceutics-16-00756"" ref-type=""bibr"">42</xref>]; similar results were found in both sexes. Moreover, we demonstrated that CYP46A1-HA-positive cells were detected in specific areas of the brain, along with a high percentage of NeuN/hCYP46A1-HA-positive cells, such as layer V of the cerebral cortex, layer CA2/CA3 of the hippocampus, the Purkinje cells of the cerebellum, hypoglossal nuclei, and the motor nucleus of trigeminal of the medulla. However, the transduction of the vector seems to depend on the age at which the mice are injected. Indeed, for a similar dose of the vector, the mean VGC and the percentage of NeuN/hCYP46A1-HA-positive cells in the brain reduced in the treated females at 12 weeks than in the treated males at three weeks. This could be explained by the period of brain maturation, which ends around three months in the mouse [<xref rid=""B43-pharmaceutics-16-00756"" ref-type=""bibr"">43</xref>]. Indeed, at three weeks, the brain’s development in the mouse is not complete in comparison to 12 weeks, and the BBB can especially be more permeable. In addition, in the RTT mouse model, <italic toggle=""yes"">Mecp2</italic><sup>−/Y</sup> is a neurodevelopmental disease that leads to weight loss and reduced brain size [<xref rid=""B17-pharmaceutics-16-00756"" ref-type=""bibr"">17</xref>,<xref rid=""B34-pharmaceutics-16-00756"" ref-type=""bibr"">34</xref>,<xref rid=""B37-pharmaceutics-16-00756"" ref-type=""bibr"">37</xref>]. Consequently, brain maturation should be delayed in Mecp2 KO males. On the contrary, <italic toggle=""yes"">Mecp2</italic><sup>+/−</sup> female mice were injected with the treatment when their brains were mature. Moreover, the phenotype is less severe in <italic toggle=""yes"">Mecp2</italic><sup>+/−</sup> females than in Mecp2 KO males, explaining the difference in CNS transduction between these two.  A study has shown that AAVPHP.eB relies on the ApoE-LDLR pathway to transduce the CNS and suggests that host immunity may contribute to the strain specificity of AAVPHP.eB [<xref rid=""B44-pharmaceutics-16-00756"" ref-type=""bibr"">44</xref>]. In addition, the permeability of the BBB is altered during healthy aging and neurodegenerative disorders [<xref rid=""B45-pharmaceutics-16-00756"" ref-type=""bibr"">45</xref>,<xref rid=""B46-pharmaceutics-16-00756"" ref-type=""bibr"">46</xref>], which can also favor the transduction of the vector in the CNS.  The overexpression of <italic toggle=""yes"">Cyp46A1</italic> in 6-week-old <italic toggle=""yes"">Mecp2</italic> males led to a restoration of levels in 7-lathosterol, lanosterol, and 27OH as well as an upregulation of desmosterol, 24-OH cholesterol, and 25-OH cholesterol levels in the brain, but no change in gene expression involved in the cholesterol pathway was observed in the brains of different groups. On the contrary, this overexpression in 10-week-old <italic toggle=""yes"">Mecp2</italic> males led to a restoration of <italic toggle=""yes"">Dhcr7</italic> expression in the cerebellum and an upregulation of all gene expressions (i.e., <italic toggle=""yes"">ApoE</italic>, <italic toggle=""yes"">Srebp1</italic>, <italic toggle=""yes"">Srebp2</italic>, <italic toggle=""yes"">Hmgcr</italic>, <italic toggle=""yes"">Dhcr7</italic>) in the rest of the brain. Lopez et al. demonstrated that a reduction in brain cholesterol synthesis of <italic toggle=""yes"">Mecp2</italic><sup>−/Y</sup> was evident three weeks after birth and observed age-related changes in the brain mRNA expression levels of several enzymes involved in the cholesterol pathway. However, no change in the brain mRNA expression levels of murine <italic toggle=""yes"">Cyp46A1</italic> or <italic toggle=""yes"">ApoE</italic> was observed in <italic toggle=""yes"">Mecp2</italic><sup>−/Y</sup> mice with age [<xref rid=""B17-pharmaceutics-16-00756"" ref-type=""bibr"">17</xref>], which fully correlates with our results. Indeed, m<italic toggle=""yes"">Cyp46A1</italic> expression was not modified in the brains of <italic toggle=""yes"">Mecp2</italic> mice and treated mice despite the overexpression of <italic toggle=""yes"">hCyp46A1</italic> in these brains. The brain mRNA expression levels of the genes involved in the cholesterol pathway did not change three weeks after the treatment, whereas cholesterol and oxysterol contents were restored or upregulated in the brains of 6-week-old <italic toggle=""yes"">Mecp2</italic><sup>−/Y</sup> mice. The assessment of the therapeutic effect, only three weeks after administration, may be too short for the mRNA expression levels of these genes to change, whereas seven weeks after administration, the levels of some gene expressions in the cholesterol pathway can be modified. Studies in which the overexpression of CYP46A1 was performed found scant modification of the cholesterol pathway. Indeed, an injection of the AAV5-CYP46A1 vector in the cerebral cortex and hippocampus of the APP23 mouse model of AD increased the level of 24-hydroxycholesterol without global cholesterol change, and only <italic toggle=""yes"">Hmgcr</italic> and <italic toggle=""yes"">Srebp2 expression</italic> were upregulated, permitting to maintain the steady-state level of brain cholesterol [<xref rid=""B29-pharmaceutics-16-00756"" ref-type=""bibr"">29</xref>]. A striatal injection of AAV-CYP46A1 in the R6/2 mouse model of Huntington’s disease restored levels of cholesterol and lanosterol as well as increased levels of desmosterol [<xref rid=""B30-pharmaceutics-16-00756"" ref-type=""bibr"">30</xref>]. Our results fully correlate with previous studies in other mouse models.  Abnormalities in mitochondrial structure and function have been described in both RTT patients and <italic toggle=""yes"">Mecp2</italic>-deficient mouse models [<xref rid=""B38-pharmaceutics-16-00756"" ref-type=""bibr"">38</xref>,<xref rid=""B47-pharmaceutics-16-00756"" ref-type=""bibr"">47</xref>,<xref rid=""B48-pharmaceutics-16-00756"" ref-type=""bibr"">48</xref>,<xref rid=""B49-pharmaceutics-16-00756"" ref-type=""bibr"">49</xref>]. RTT shares many features with mitochondrial diseases, including early symptomatic onset, developmental delay, neurological regression, poor muscle tone, seizures, and gastrointestinal issues [<xref rid=""B50-pharmaceutics-16-00756"" ref-type=""bibr"">50</xref>]. Increased oxidative stress and decreased levels of mitochondrial enzymes were constantly present in both RTT patients and Mecp2-deficient mice [<xref rid=""B48-pharmaceutics-16-00756"" ref-type=""bibr"">48</xref>,<xref rid=""B51-pharmaceutics-16-00756"" ref-type=""bibr"">51</xref>,<xref rid=""B52-pharmaceutics-16-00756"" ref-type=""bibr"">52</xref>]. Moreover, markers of oxidative stress increased with age in Mecp2-deficient mice, suggesting a progressive dysfunction of mitochondrial function [<xref rid=""B53-pharmaceutics-16-00756"" ref-type=""bibr"">53</xref>]. These findings suggest that defects in mitochondrial energy production may be present in RTT. It is important to underline that mitochondrial energy production is closely linked with cholesterol synthesis. Indeed, several steps in the biosynthesis of cholesterol require mitochondrial sources of ATP as an electron donor in oxygenation reactions. Consequently, cholesterol perturbations may be linked with mitochondrial dysfunction in RTT. We have specifically analyzed mitochondrial aconitase activity to determine whether the overexpression of Cyp46A1 could act on/improve mitochondrial function in the brains of 10-week-old males and 35-week-old female mecp2 mice. Mitochondrial aconitase belongs to the family of iron–sulfur-containing dehydratases, and it catalyzes the conversion of citrate to isocitrate in the Kreb’s cycle. Mitochondrial aconitase is also a reversible enzyme since it undergoes reversible, citrate-dependent inactivation induced by oxidants, which causes the disassembly of the iron–sulfur cluster, impacting its activity. Indeed, aconitase is highly sensitive to oxidative inactivation and can aggregate and accumulate in the mitochondrial matrix, causing mitochondrial dysfunction. We have demonstrated that mitochondrial aconitase activity was reduced in <italic toggle=""yes"">Mecp2</italic> male and female mice. After the administration of AAVPHP.eB-hCYP46A1-HA in these mice, we observed an over-activity of the enzyme in the treated females and an improvement of its activity in the treated males, indicating that our treatment maintains or delays defects in mitochondrial function. We noticed that mitochondrial aconitase activity was not completely restored in the treated mice. This may be linked to the extremely severe phenotype of Mecp2-deficient males, and the treatment is not sufficient to overcome all abnormalities present in this model; however, the treatment would delay/reduce defects in mitochondrial function. On the contrary, in Mecp2 female mice, the phenotype is less severe, and the overexpression of Cyp46A1 over-activates mitochondrial aconitase.  The intravenous administration of AAVPHP.eB-hCYP46A1-HA did not lead to neuroinflammation. <italic toggle=""yes"">Mecp2</italic> expression is mainly detected in neurons but can be found at lower levels in glia cells [<xref rid=""B54-pharmaceutics-16-00756"" ref-type=""bibr"">54</xref>,<xref rid=""B55-pharmaceutics-16-00756"" ref-type=""bibr"">55</xref>]. <italic toggle=""yes"">Mecp2</italic> deficiency in astrocytes could contributes to neuropathological manifestations of RTT [<xref rid=""B56-pharmaceutics-16-00756"" ref-type=""bibr"">56</xref>,<xref rid=""B57-pharmaceutics-16-00756"" ref-type=""bibr"">57</xref>,<xref rid=""B58-pharmaceutics-16-00756"" ref-type=""bibr"">58</xref>,<xref rid=""B59-pharmaceutics-16-00756"" ref-type=""bibr"">59</xref>]. Indeed, the conditional reactivation of <italic toggle=""yes"">Mecp2</italic> in the astrocytes of <italic toggle=""yes"">Mecp2</italic>-deficient mice ameliorates dendritic complexity, neuronal soma size, and levels of vesicular glutamate transporter 1, and at the behavioral level, and thus improves locomotor and respiratory defects, as well as extending lifespan [<xref rid=""B60-pharmaceutics-16-00756"" ref-type=""bibr"">60</xref>]. Studies have reported that the mRNA level of <italic toggle=""yes"">Gfap</italic> and the protein level of GFAP were not significantly altered in the RTT mice compared to those in the control mice [<xref rid=""B61-pharmaceutics-16-00756"" ref-type=""bibr"">61</xref>,<xref rid=""B62-pharmaceutics-16-00756"" ref-type=""bibr"">62</xref>]. These findings are in agreement with our results; indeed, the number of astrocytes did not significantly differ between the WT and <italic toggle=""yes"">Mecp2</italic> mice. Moreover, the AAVPHP.eB has been described extensively and notably in other studies from our groups using other transgenes; it has never been linked to any inflammation following injection<sup>41</sup>, and intravenous administration is considered as invasive, especially for translation to humans. Interestingly, recent reports have found roles for <italic toggle=""yes"">Mecp2</italic> in microglia [<xref rid=""B59-pharmaceutics-16-00756"" ref-type=""bibr"">59</xref>,<xref rid=""B63-pharmaceutics-16-00756"" ref-type=""bibr"">63</xref>,<xref rid=""B64-pharmaceutics-16-00756"" ref-type=""bibr"">64</xref>,<xref rid=""B65-pharmaceutics-16-00756"" ref-type=""bibr"">65</xref>]. A loss of microglia was observed specifically in the brain of late-phenotypic Mecp2 mice (i.e., 8–12 weeks). All these results are coherent with the absence of the loss of microglia in 6-week-old Mecp2 males or in 35-week-old Mecp2 females but a significant increase in microglia in the cerebral cortices of Mecp2 males in comparison to WT mice. All these results demonstrate that the treatment does not act on the neuroinflammation of treated mice.  Finally, we observed a decrease in the number of Purkinje cells of female and male <italic toggle=""yes"">Mecp2</italic> mice, as previously reported that Mecp2 is expressed in the cerebellar neurons of 6-month-old WT mice [<xref rid=""B66-pharmaceutics-16-00756"" ref-type=""bibr"">66</xref>]. Cerebellar pathology has been described in RTT patients as characterized by the loss of Purkinje cells, atrophy, astrocytic gliosis of the molecular and granular cell layers, and gliosis and the loss of myelin in the white matter [<xref rid=""B67-pharmaceutics-16-00756"" ref-type=""bibr"">67</xref>]. In mice, the loss of <italic toggle=""yes"">Mecp2</italic> causes deficits in motor coordination and motor learning, hindlimb clasping, hypoactivity, and tremors [<xref rid=""B37-pharmaceutics-16-00756"" ref-type=""bibr"">37</xref>,<xref rid=""B68-pharmaceutics-16-00756"" ref-type=""bibr"">68</xref>,<xref rid=""B69-pharmaceutics-16-00756"" ref-type=""bibr"">69</xref>]. The loss of Purkinje cells observed in our RTT model could be coherent even if no study has reported it in RTT mouse models.  We investigated the therapeutic effect of the intravenous administration of AAVPHP.eB-CYP46A1-HA in Mecp2<sup>−/Y</sup> and Mecp2<sup>+/−</sup> mice. Our therapy targets the cholesterol pathway since RTT patients and mice have shown deficits in this pathway [<xref rid=""B11-pharmaceutics-16-00756"" ref-type=""bibr"">11</xref>,<xref rid=""B12-pharmaceutics-16-00756"" ref-type=""bibr"">12</xref>,<xref rid=""B13-pharmaceutics-16-00756"" ref-type=""bibr"">13</xref>,<xref rid=""B14-pharmaceutics-16-00756"" ref-type=""bibr"">14</xref>,<xref rid=""B15-pharmaceutics-16-00756"" ref-type=""bibr"">15</xref>,<xref rid=""B16-pharmaceutics-16-00756"" ref-type=""bibr"">16</xref>,<xref rid=""B17-pharmaceutics-16-00756"" ref-type=""bibr"">17</xref>], and as we have previously demonstrated in Alzheimer, ALS, SCA, and Huntington mouse models, the overexpression of CYP46A1 can restore or improve some symptoms present in these models [<xref rid=""B29-pharmaceutics-16-00756"" ref-type=""bibr"">29</xref>,<xref rid=""B30-pharmaceutics-16-00756"" ref-type=""bibr"">30</xref>,<xref rid=""B70-pharmaceutics-16-00756"" ref-type=""bibr"">70</xref>]. In <italic toggle=""yes"">Mecp2</italic> mice, the overexpression of <italic toggle=""yes"">Cyp46A1</italic> improves the mevalonate pathway, mitochondrial aconitase activity, and hindlimb clasping without causing neuroinflammation. Moreover, the lifespan was improved in Mecp2 males, suggesting that our treatment delays the disease progression. CYP46A1 is clearly a relevant target for RTT, but the treatment alone may not be sufficient to cure RTT [<xref rid=""B71-pharmaceutics-16-00756"" ref-type=""bibr"">71</xref>] compared to what we have demonstrated for other pathologies such as AD, HD, SCA, and ALS [<xref rid=""B29-pharmaceutics-16-00756"" ref-type=""bibr"">29</xref>,<xref rid=""B30-pharmaceutics-16-00756"" ref-type=""bibr"">30</xref>,<xref rid=""B72-pharmaceutics-16-00756"" ref-type=""bibr"">72</xref>].  These results are significantly noteworthy in view of the CYP46A1 mechanism of action. Indeed, in all our previous studies, we had abnormal protein aggregations (HTT, amyloid peptide, SOD, and ataxin), and we demonstrated the role of CYP46A1 on both the clearance of this misfolded protein as well as a neuroprotective effect. This effect can always be argued as a result of clearance of the misfolded protein and not a neuroprotective action of CYP46A1 per se. Here, for the first time, we demonstrated the role of CYP on the neuroprotection itself. Regarding translation of Rett treatment to clinic, we might thus consider a combination of treatments to increase the success of these strategies. The best approach could be to target the <italic toggle=""yes"">Mecp2</italic> mutation by restoring the defective gene but need to avoid an overexpression of Mecp2, which has detrimental effects [<xref rid=""B73-pharmaceutics-16-00756"" ref-type=""bibr"">73</xref>]. In this direction, several clinical trials are underway: (i) a phase 1/2 trial (NCT05606614) is open to study the safety and preliminary efficacy of a single intrathecal administration of TSHA-102, an AAV9-delivered gene therapy (TSHA-102 is a recombinant, non-replicating, self-complementary AAV9 (scAAV9) vector encoding for the miniMECP2 gene); (ii) NCT05740761 proposes gene editing (MECPer-3D); and finally, (iii) a phase ½ trial (NCT05898620) is open to assess the safety, tolerability, and efficacy of the single intracerebroventricular (ICV) administration of NGN-401 in pediatric subjects with RTT (NGN-401 contains a full-length human Mecp2 gene that is designed to express the therapeutic levels of the Mecp2 protein while avoiding overexpression). Our study highlighted the relevant role of CYP46A1 in Rett treatment and proposes the restoration of neuronal cholesterol metabolism through the overexpression of CYP46A1 as a therapeutic option for RTT patients. AAVPHP.eB-hCYP46A1 perfectly targets the region of interest by essentially transducing the neurons of the CNS. CYP46A1 overexpression alleviates behavioral alterations in both male and female <italic toggle=""yes"">Mecp2</italic> mice and extends the lifespan in <italic toggle=""yes"">Mecp2</italic> males. Several parameters of the cholesterol pathway are improved in the treated mice as well as a restoration of the and mitochondrial activity. No inflammation or neuronal damage is observed in the CNS of the treated mice as a sign of perfect tolerance of the AAVPHP.eB delivery and safety of CYP46A1 overexpression in neurons. Altogether, our results strongly suggest that CYP46A1 could be a relevant target in RTT, combined with another therapy, and demonstrate, for the first time, the neuroprotective effect of CYP46A1 overexpression independent of misfolded protein clearance.

Probing a neural unreliability account of auditory sensory processing atypicalities in Rett Syndrome,,"Rett Syndrome (RTT), an X-linked monogenic disorder caused by de novo mutations in the Methyl-CpG-binding protein 2 gene (<italic toggle=""yes"">MeCP2</italic>), is associated with severe intellectual disability in female children [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR1"">1</xref>, <xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR48"">48</xref>]. Classical RTT begins with early onset neurodevelopmental regression, typically detected between 6 to 18 months of age, that results in progressive loss of previously acquired speech and motor skills [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR27"">27</xref>]. The inability to verbalize, a feature in the vast majority of these children, substantially impedes objective clinical assessments of their perceptual and cognitive functioning since conventional cognitive evaluations rely heavily on overt verbal or gestural responses [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR6"">6</xref>]. As such, primary outcome measures in RTT are generally based on clinical judgement. As a consequence, there is limited knowledge about the perceptual and cognitive capabilities of these individuals across the progressive clinical stages of RTT [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR18"">18</xref>, <xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR52"">52</xref>]. The lack of objective assessment tools adversely impacts both clinical evaluation and the measurement of therapeutic efficacy during intervention trials. It is therefore imperative for the field to identify quantitative measures of neural function that can be objectively measured and longitudinally monitored to capture more subtle changes in neurological function [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR18"">18</xref>, <xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR58"">58</xref>], ideally without the need for active task participation on the part of these individuals given the typical severity of the phenotype. Developing such measures would provide surrogate biomarkers of disease severity and potentially provide precise measurement of target engagement and longitudinal evaluations of treatment effects during clinical trials [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR18"">18</xref>, <xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR58"">58</xref>]. To this end, a number of research groups have now deployed electroencephalographic (EEG) recordings as a means to directly measure brain function in neurodevelopmental disorders [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR4"">4</xref>, <xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR8"">8</xref>, <xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR13"">13</xref>, <xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR22"">22</xref>, <xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR35"">35</xref>, <xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR51"">51</xref>, <xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR55"">55</xref>, <xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR64"">64</xref>]. EEG provides an easy-to-deploy method to assay neurodevelopmental regression in the absence of overt behavioral responses from participants (e.g. [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR4"">4</xref>, <xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR18"">18</xref>, <xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR51"">51</xref>, <xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR61"">61</xref>]). The millisecond-precision of this tool is ideal for assessment of dynamic brain function and can be used to determine the processing level at which information flow is breaking down [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR21"">21</xref>, <xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR47"">47</xref>, <xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR61"">61</xref>]. This is achieved by assaying the latencies and amplitudes of well-characterized event-related potential (ERP) components, which have stereotypical topology and temporal dynamics in neurotypical populations, and have been well characterized in thousands of papers over the past 60 years [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR14"">14</xref>, <xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR39"">39</xref>, <xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR44"">44</xref>, <xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR54"">54</xref>, <xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR62"">62</xref>, <xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR65"">65</xref>, <xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR66"">66</xref>]. A high degree of test–retest reliability is also a feature of this method, making it ideal for longitudinal monitoring of intervention trials [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR5"">5</xref>, <xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR34"">34</xref>, <xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR42"">42</xref>]. However, a central assumption of this methodology is stationarity of response – that is, that when a stimulus is presented repeatedly to a participant, the neural response on each iteration (or trial) is assumed to be essentially identical, whereby the simple process of signal-averaging across trials will reveal this stationary canonical response because temporally random background activity (noise) will be eliminated through the averaging procedure [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR30"">30</xref>, <xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR39"">39</xref>, <xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR54"">54</xref>]. While this is perhaps not an unreasonable assumption in studies of neurotypical individuals, it may not be fully justified to assume that near-perfect stationarity is a feature of sensory perceptual processing in neurodevelopmental and neuropsychiatric conditions. For example, a number of researchers have proposed that the neural response in autism spectrum disorder (ASD) may be more variable, or unreliable, on a trial-to-trial basis [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR28"">28</xref>, <xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR29"">29</xref>, <xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR46"">46</xref>] (but see [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR13"">13</xref>, <xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR19"">19</xref>, <xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR36"">36</xref>]). That is, it could be the case that an evoked response is produced to each stimulus iteration in these conditions, but that from trial to trial, this evoked response might vary in the latencies and amplitudes of the canonical components. In such a situation, signal averaging will have the same impact on these “signals” as it does on the background noise – that is, they will tend to reduce towards zero. To date, most ERP studies in Rett have shown highly disordered sensory responses, both in audition [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR3"">3</xref>, <xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR12"">12</xref>, <xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR20"">20</xref>, <xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR33"">33</xref>, <xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR53"">53</xref>, <xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR57"">57</xref>, <xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR67"">67</xref>] and vision [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR2"">2</xref>, <xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR31"">31</xref>, <xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR38"">38</xref>, <xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR45"">45</xref>, <xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR60"">60</xref>, <xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR63"">63</xref>], but to our knowledge, all of these previous studies, including those from our own research group, rely on the standard signal-averaging approach. Here, we are interested in determining whether a higher degree of variability, both at the individual participant and at the group level, might be a factor in the reduced and delayed ERP responses typically reported in RTT. This is important, because it can have significant implications for the use of the standard ERP as a neuromarker in clinical trials, and it is plausible that functionality at the individual participant level is being obscured by the averaging technique. This is also the case at the group level, where idiosyncratic ERP morphologies and timings at the individual level, when averaged together across the group, could potentially give the impression that the group has a much greater overall deficit than is actually the case. We set out to test what we have termed the “unreliability account” by measuring the coherence of the auditory evoked potential (AEP) in both RTT and neurotypical (NT) age-matched controls at the single trial level, with an eye to more deeply characterizing potential auditory functionality in RTT. We recorded the AEP from a 72-channel montage in response to simple 1 kHz pure tones at three different stimulus-onset-asynchronies (SOA’s: 450, 900 and 1800 ms, see [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR12"">12</xref>], in which standard group analyses of the averaged ERP focused on the mismatch negativity (MMN) response is reported for the same dataset). The relatively large numbers of trials presented to each participant (850 per condition, see Table S2) allowed for in-depth analysis at the single trial level, which is necessary for measures of inter-trial (i.e. intra-participant) variability with high statistical power. To measure inter-trial reliability of the auditory responses, we applied a number of relevant approaches, calculating inter-trial-variability (ITV), signal-to-noise estimates (SNR), and inter-trail phase coherence (ITPC) at the individual participant level. We additionally sought to better understand the inter-participant variability that may derive from combining participants across various stages of disease severity by comparing homogeneity of the AEP between the groups. Another consideration when making EEG/ERP recordings in clinical populations is baseline differences in non-neural sources of noise, such as those produced by muscle or movement artifacts [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR25"">25</xref>], which can also serve to reduce the reliability of estimations of neural activity and potentially lead to overestimation of inter-group differences. To this end, we applied data denoising source separation (DSS) to separate temporally coupled signal carrying components from temporally decoupled activity [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR16"">16</xref>, <xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR26"">26</xref>, <xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR59"">59</xref>], and compared all of the above measures post-compared to pre- DSS signal derivation.   Event-related potential recordings provide a simple, highly portable and relatively inexpensive means of directly and objectively recording neural processing outcomes from human subjects, even in patient populations where task compliance or the following of instructions is compromised or infeasible. Considerable work has now shown that measures of auditory evoked potentials (AEPs) are highly disordered in Rett syndrome [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR3"">3</xref>, <xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR12"">12</xref>, <xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR20"">20</xref>, <xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR33"">33</xref>, <xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR53"">53</xref>, <xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR57"">57</xref>], and that these measures are correlated with clinical measures of disease severity [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR67"">67</xref>]. As a direct measure of neural function, therefore, these AEP measures hold much promise as neuromarkers against which the effectiveness of therapeutic interventions could be measured. It is a reasonable proposition that such measures are much closer to the site of action in pharmacological or gene therapy interventions and might be expected to show treatment-related changes much sooner than clinical observational measures that rely on changes in symptomatology or behavioral outcomes. These latter changes would be expected to emerge over relatively long timeframes, secondary to improvements in neural functioning. However, standard AEP/ERP signal processing techniques, which typically involve the averaging of multiple responses across trials, introduce significant risk of obscuring variability across individual neural responses, and could lead to overestimation of the extent of processing deficit that is actually present in a given individual. Here, the fact that there were three AEP conditions (i.e. three different inter-stimulus intervals were used in separate experimental blocks) allowed for a within-subject comparison across these conditions. What becomes clear upon simple visual inspection is that highly anomalous component morphology is common in RTT (see Figs. <xref rid=""Fig1"" ref-type=""fig"">1</xref> and <xref rid=""Fig2"" ref-type=""fig"">2</xref>), such that if an experimenter were to observe just one of these averaged AEPs for a given RTT participant, the presence of a response might be questionable. However, it is also clear from visual inspection that such anomalous morphologies are generally consistent across all three conditions – that is, similar appearing AEP responses are evident in most RTT participants. This is in contrast to the TD participants where for the most part, typical AEP morphology is observed. Put another way, in TD participants, there is a “central tendency” whereas in RTT participants, there is a tendency towards highly individualized responses. As mentioned in the Introduction, this has significant impact on group-averaged comparisons. Whereas the central tendency of the AEP in TDs will lead to a robust group-averaged waveform, the highly variable individual morphologies expressed in RTT will, by definition, lead to a weak group-averaged estimation. The highly idiosyncratic processing within the RTT group likely reflects disruption of typical processing along the auditory cortical processing hierarchy that does not manifest across patients in a stereotyped way. Here, we set out to better understand this potential response variability by deploying a set of signal-processing tools at the single trial level, including denoising source separation, inter-trail variability estimation, inter-trial phase coherence measures, and estimates of signal-to-noise ratios. First, using the standard canonical component-based ERP analysis techniques, the current work replicated previous outcomes of strikingly atypical group level AEPs in individuals with RTT, which were evident at each of the three stimulation rates used (Figs. <xref rid=""Fig1"" ref-type=""fig"">1</xref> and <xref rid=""Fig2"" ref-type=""fig"">2</xref>) [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR12"">12</xref>], differences that were manifest as substantially reduced AEP component amplitudes in RTT versus TD [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR57"">57</xref>, <xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR67"">67</xref>]. In turn, taking advantage of the large number of trials per condition that were recorded in this study, we assessed inter-trial response variability to the auditory stimuli at the individual participant level. Across all metrics: signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), inter-trial variability (ITV) (see Fig. <xref rid=""Fig5"" ref-type=""fig"">5</xref>), and inter-trial phase coherence (ITPC: Fig. <xref rid=""Fig6"" ref-type=""fig"">6</xref>), significantly higher levels of response variability were observed in RTT compared to the TD participants. Another possible confounding factor when comparing RTT, or indeed any clincial population, to TD controls using EEG meaures is that neural repsonses might be obscured by excessive non-neural noise (e.g. movement artifacts, muscle tension or flexion noise, excessive eye-movements or blinking, bruxism, etc.). To mitigate such influences, we also applied the denoising source separation (DSS) algorithm, a joint-decorrelation technique that suppresses the most prominent non-neural noise sources, and preserves the activity of interest [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR15"">15</xref>]. The previous set of analyses were then repeated using these DSS accentuated signals. Clear improvements in the signal post-DSS were observed for both groups, but especially so for the RTT group, such that large between-groups differences in the amplitude of the N2 AEP component and measures of inter-trial variability (ITV) that were observed prior to denoising, were no longer statistically detectable following application of the technique. However, post-DSS measures of SNR remained significantly lower in the RTT group, and differences between RTT and TD in ITPC were even more robust following DSS. Taken together, these analyses make clear that non-neural sources of noise very likely contribute to overestimation of the extent of AEP deficits in RTT but that clear deficits remain detectable following denoising that minimizes the contribution of non-neural noise to response estimates. This suggests that application of DSS should likely be a facet of any signal-processing pipeline designed to test neural information processing in individuals with rare diseases like RTT. The SNR calculations pre- versus post- denoising are highly instructive in this regard, demonstrating clear and rather dramatic effects of applying DSS. In the case of the RTT group, SNR across conditions increased from 7.8 to 30.1, representing a massive 3.9-fold increase in signal estimation. SNR did also increase in the TD group, but by a more modest amount (26.1 to 41.4), a 1.6-fold increase. While SNR in RTT remained significantly lower than that found in TD, it is clear that pre-denoising, this difference was substantially overestimated and suggested a much greater deficit than is likely the case. Non-evoked potential noise is therefore a major source of potentially confounding variance in inter-group comparisons concerning RTT individuals and should be a consideration in all studies assessing differences between rare-disease clinical groups and neurotypical control populations. Similarly, AEP peak voltage variability, assessed by ITV, improved post-DSS in both groups, but more so in RTT (a 4.5-fold decrease, from 7.76 to 1.75µv) than TD (a 2.3-fold decrease, from 3.50 to 1.54 µv). This time, group differences in ITV were, in fact, no longer statistically detectable post-DSS. Lastly, in the case of ITPC, DSS also significantly improved these estimates in both populations. In the TD group, ITPC estimate pre-DSS was 0.14 but this improved to 0.26 following denoising, whereas in the RTT group the improvement was more modest (0.10 to 0.15). For both pre- and post- DSS estimates, the difference between TD and RTT participants was statistically robust. Thus, while denoising substantially improves SNR in RTT and leads to lower estimates of inter-trial variability both in terms of response amplitudes and phase, substantial deficits remained in the RTT group in SNR and ITPC measures of response variability, whereas this was not the case for ITV. In summary, while previous results showed robust evoked-response atypicalities using the standard component-based ERP approach, the present work suggests that the addition of measures that assess response variability can add significant insight into putative dysfunction and may well provide more sensitive biomarkers for assessment of treatment effects on neural function. That ITPC is found to be significantly lower in RTT, even post-DSS, provides at least partial support for a neural unreliability account of auditory processing deficits in this population, although lower SNR estimates and idiosyncratic temporal evolution of the AEP also suggest that sensory processing is both attenuated and temporally disrupted, and that the differences between RTT and TD are not wholly accounted for by “unreliable” responsivity. This study deployed in-depth analysis of auditory evoked response variability to assess the contribution of the degree of response variability (unreliability) to altered auditory processing in RTT. We replicated previous outcomes of atypical AEP morphologies and significantly reduced AEP amplitudes in Rett Syndrome using standard component-based ERP analysis. Using metrics that specifically measured neuronal variability, we observed substantially increased inter-trial variability, lower signal-to-noise ratios, and reduced inter-trial phase coherence in the auditory responses of RTT participants, providing strong support for a “neural unreliability” account in this population. However, deployment of denoising source separation (DSS) techniques painted a somewhat different picture, making it clear that non-neural sources of noise are a likely contributor to overestimation of the extent of auditory processing deficits in this population. Post-DSS, ITV measures were substantially reduced, so much so that pre-DSS ITV differences between RTT and TD populations were no longer detected. In the case of SNR and ITPC, DSS substantially improved these estimates in the RTT population, but robust differences between RTT and TD were still fully evident. This work strongly suggests that employing DSS techniques will provide much better estimates of veridical sensory-perceptual processing abilities in rare disease populations such as RTT, or in any other population where a high degree of non-neural noise and high inter-individual variability are expected to be major contributors.

A small-molecule TrkB ligand improves dendritic spine phenotypes and atypical behaviors in female Rett syndrome mice,"Rett syndrome (RTT) is a neurodevelopmental disorder caused by mutations in <italic toggle=""yes"">MECP2</italic>, which encodes methyl-CpG-binding protein 2, a transcriptional regulator of many genes, including brain-derived neurotrophic factor (<italic toggle=""yes"">BDNF</italic>). BDNF levels are lower in multiple brain regions of <italic toggle=""yes"">Mecp2</italic>-deficient mice, and experimentally increasing BDNF levels improve atypical phenotypes in <italic toggle=""yes"">Mecp2</italic> mutant mice. Due to the low blood-brain barrier permeability of BDNF itself, we tested the effects of LM22A-4, a brain-penetrant, small-molecule ligand of the BDNF receptor TrkB (encoded by <italic toggle=""yes"">Ntrk2</italic>), on dendritic spine density and form in hippocampal pyramidal neurons and on behavioral phenotypes in female <italic toggle=""yes"">Mecp2</italic> heterozygous (HET) mice. A 4-week systemic treatment of <italic toggle=""yes"">Mecp2</italic> HET mice with LM22A-4 restored spine volume in MeCP2-expressing neurons to wild-type (WT) levels, whereas spine volume in MeCP2-lacking neurons remained comparable to that in neurons from female WT mice.

Although these studies indicate that BDNF deficiency is a key component in RTT pathogenesis (<xref rid=""DMM050612C30"" ref-type=""bibr"">Katz, 2014</xref>; <xref rid=""DMM050612C35"" ref-type=""bibr"">Li and Pozzo-Miller, 2014</xref>), the therapeutic potential of BDNF is limited by its low blood-brain barrier permeability and short plasma half-life (<xref rid=""DMM050612C53"" ref-type=""bibr"">Poduslo and Curran, 1996</xref>). An alternative to BDNF itself is to use synthetic small molecules that target the TrkB receptor as ligands. An established preclinical candidate is LM22A-4, a ‘mimetic’ of the BDNF loop-2 domain that activates TrkB and its downstream signaling pathways (<xref rid=""DMM050612C43"" ref-type=""bibr"">Massa et al., 2010</xref>).

Similarly, a second-generation TrkB ligand based on LM22A-4 also improved breathing patterns and motor deficits in <italic toggle=""yes"">Mecp2</italic> HET mice (<xref rid=""DMM050612C3"" ref-type=""bibr"">Adams et al., 2020</xref>). In the present study, we tested the effects of LM22A-4 on dendritic spine density and size in hippocampal pyramidal neurons of female <italic toggle=""yes"">Mecp2</italic>-deficient mice, as well as in a machine-learning unbiased screen of open-field behaviors in female <italic toggle=""yes"">Mecp2</italic> HET mice interacting with unfamiliar and familiar mice.

We first confirmed that LM22A-4 mimics the TrkB-dependent spinogenic effect of BDNF in organotypic slice cultures from neonatal male <italic toggle=""yes"">Mecp2</italic> KO mice, but not in slice cultures from WT mice due to their typical levels of BDNF that outcompete the partial agonism of LM22A-4 on TrkB receptors. This property of LM22A-4 was described in the original paper (<xref rid=""DMM050612C43"" ref-type=""bibr"">Massa et al., 2010</xref>) and in all subsequent reports using different experimental mouse models with reduced BDNF levels, including models of Huntington's disease (<xref rid=""DMM050612C65"" ref-type=""bibr"">Simmons et al., 2013</xref>), traumatic brain injury-induced epilepsy (<xref rid=""DMM050612C23"" ref-type=""bibr"">Gu et al., 2018</xref>), Dravet's disease (<xref rid=""DMM050612C24"" ref-type=""bibr"">Gu et al., 2022</xref>), compulsive alcohol drinking (<xref rid=""DMM050612C73"" ref-type=""bibr"">Warnault et al., 2016</xref>), non-arteritic anterior ischemic optic neuropathy (<xref rid=""DMM050612C4"" ref-type=""bibr"">Ali Shariati et al., 2018</xref>) and chemotherapy-induced cognitive decline (<xref rid=""DMM050612C21"" ref-type=""bibr"">Geraghty et al., 2019</xref>). In the context of RTT, LM22A-4 also showed therapeutic effects in female <italic toggle=""yes"">Mecp2</italic> HET mice: it improved breathing irregularities (<xref rid=""DMM050612C33"" ref-type=""bibr"">Kron et al., 2014</xref>; <xref rid=""DMM050612C63"" ref-type=""bibr"">Schmid et al., 2012</xref>) and mitigated network hyperactivity in hippocampal slices, which restored LTP of CA1 excitatory synaptic transmission in hippocampal slices and improved hippocampal-dependent object location memory (<xref rid=""DMM050612C38"" ref-type=""bibr"">Li et al., 2017</xref>).

Because these studies identified therapeutic effects of a 1- to 2-month LM22A-4 treatment in 3- to 4-month-old female <italic toggle=""yes"">Mecp2</italic> HET mice, we followed the same dosage regimen to assess the effects of LM22A-4 effects on dendritic spine phenotypes in hippocampal pyramidal neurons, and on an unbiased screen of atypical behaviors at an age where most RTT-like phenotypes appear in female <italic toggle=""yes"">Mecp2</italic> HET mice (<xref rid=""DMM050612C62"" ref-type=""bibr"">Samaco et al., 2013</xref>), including breathing apneas (<xref rid=""DMM050612C33"" ref-type=""bibr"">Kron et al., 2014</xref>; <xref rid=""DMM050612C63"" ref-type=""bibr"">Schmid et al., 2012</xref>) and altered hippocampal dependent memory (<xref rid=""DMM050612C38"" ref-type=""bibr"">Li et al., 2017</xref>). Using female MeCP2-GFP HET mice revealed a non-cell-autonomous consequence of <italic toggle=""yes"">Mecp2</italic> deletion on dendritic spines in the mosaic brain of female RTT mice: CA1 hippocampal pyramidal neurons that express MeCP2 (i.e. WT cells) had larger dendritic spines than neighboring neurons lacking MeCP2 (i.e. mutant cells) and those in female WT mice. We interpret these larger spines to reflect an activity-dependent response of MeCP2-expressing neurons to the atypically heightened hippocampal network activity in female <italic toggle=""yes"">Mecp2</italic> HET mice (<xref rid=""DMM050612C38"" ref-type=""bibr"">Li et al., 2017</xref>). In contrast, MeCP2-lacking neurons may have lost their capacity for dendritic spine plasticity, similar to the saturation of LTP in CA1 pyramidal neurons in male <italic toggle=""yes"">Mecp2</italic> KO mice, caused by atypically stronger excitatory synapses due to impaired synaptic trafficking of GluA1 (encoded by <italic toggle=""yes"">Gria1</italic>)-containing AMPA receptors (<xref rid=""DMM050612C37"" ref-type=""bibr"">Li et al., 2016</xref>). Note that the expression of TrkB receptors is not affected by <italic toggle=""yes"">Mecp2</italic> deletion (<xref rid=""DMM050612C36"" ref-type=""bibr"">Li et al., 2012</xref>). These observations resemble the non-cell-autonomous consequences of <italic toggle=""yes"">Mecp2</italic> deletion in the primary motor cortex of female <italic toggle=""yes"">Mecp2</italic> HET mice, where <italic toggle=""yes"">Mecp2</italic>-expressing neurons have a lower spine density than that of both <italic toggle=""yes"">Mecp2</italic>-lacking neurons and neurons in female WT mice (<xref rid=""DMM050612C7"" ref-type=""bibr"">Belichenko et al., 2009</xref>). Moreover, the size of the cell body of <italic toggle=""yes"">Mecp2</italic>-expressing neurons in female <italic toggle=""yes"">Mecp2</italic> HET mice is smaller than that of neurons in female WT mice (<xref rid=""DMM050612C57"" ref-type=""bibr"">Rietveld et al., 2015</xref>; <xref rid=""DMM050612C75"" ref-type=""bibr"">Wither et al., 2013</xref>; reviewed in <xref rid=""DMM050612C55"" ref-type=""bibr"">Ribeiro and MacDonald, 2020</xref>). Interestingly, LM22A-4 reduced the spine volume in MeCP2-expressing neurons to levels seen in female WT mice, which is consistent with its reduction of hippocampal hyperactivity that allowed typical LTP and restored object-location memory in female <italic toggle=""yes"">Mecp2</italic> HET mice (<xref rid=""DMM050612C38"" ref-type=""bibr"">Li et al., 2017</xref>). Here, we investigated the effects of a 4-week LM22A-4 treatment on social behaviors in female <italic toggle=""yes"">Mecp2</italic> HET mice, focusing on key aspects such as sociability, social memory and naturalistic behaviors. In the standard three-chamber social interaction test, no differences in sociability and social memory were found, with LM22A-4 treatment demonstrating no effect. Minute-by-minute analysis of the three-chamber social interaction test revealed a delayed social memory in <italic toggle=""yes"">Mecp2</italic> HET mice in comparison to that in WT controls, an effect not mitigated by LM22A-4 treatment. The unrestricted assay highlighted the efficacy of LM22A-4 in reducing aggressive behaviors in 5-month-old <italic toggle=""yes"">Mecp2</italic> HET mice, surmising its positive impact on disease manifestations. However, this effect was more limited in an older cohort (7-month-old mice), suggesting a potential impact of disease progression in <italic toggle=""yes"">Mecp2</italic> HET mice. Notably, at 7 months of age, <italic toggle=""yes"">Mecp2</italic> HET mice demonstrated increased shuffling locomotion, further emphasizing the progression of the observed effects. All in all, our study brings to light behavioral alterations in female <italic toggle=""yes"">Mecp2</italic> HET mice, presenting comprehensive social dynamics across the disease progression. These findings demonstrate the potential therapeutic significance of LM22A-4, providing a promising avenue for investigation in the context of RTT and neurodevelopmental disorders. The progression of behavioral phenotypes in female <italic toggle=""yes"">Mecp2</italic> HET mice is not a simple process of all deficits equally worsening with age, resembling the onset and waning of different neuropsychiatric signs in individuals with RTT during the regression, pseudo-stationary and deterioration phases of the disorder (<xref rid=""DMM050612C60"" ref-type=""bibr"">Samaco and Neul, 2011</xref>). Our results indicate that female <italic toggle=""yes"">Mecp2</italic> HET mice display more aggressive behaviors at 5 months of age than age-matched female WT mice, which is absent at 7 months of age. Another example is the anxiety phenotype during the open-field test, which was enhanced in 3-month-old female <italic toggle=""yes"">Mecp2</italic> HET mice, whereas this difference was absent at 5 months of age and returned later at 7 months (<xref rid=""DMM050612C56"" ref-type=""bibr"">Ribeiro and MacDonald, 2022</xref>). Taken together, these data indicate that social and aggression behaviors may be altered in female <italic toggle=""yes"">Mecp2</italic> HET mice prior to their shuffling locomotion, and that LM22A-4 only improves some of the affected behaviors. Interestingly, social aggression was reported in male mice lacking <italic toggle=""yes"">Mecp2</italic> in either <italic toggle=""yes"">Sim1</italic>-expressing or serotonergic PET1 (FEV)-expressing neurons (<xref rid=""DMM050612C61"" ref-type=""bibr"">Samaco et al., 2009</xref>). Similarly, <italic toggle=""yes"">Mecp2</italic> deletion in PET1-expressing neurons led to an aggressive phenotype in male mice, despite a lack of an anxiety phenotype, as tested in the open-field or ‘light-dark box’ assays (<xref rid=""DMM050612C20"" ref-type=""bibr"">Fyffe et al., 2008</xref>). In a different study, male <italic toggle=""yes"">Mecp2</italic> KO mice showed hyper-reactive escape and defensive behaviors in a ‘mouse defense test battery’ assay (‘predator avoidance’, ‘chase/flight’, ‘closed-door approach’, and ‘forced-contact’ tests), despite the lack of an anxiety phenotype, as tested in the ‘elevated plus’ maze and ‘elevated zero’ maze (<xref rid=""DMM050612C50"" ref-type=""bibr"">Pearson et al., 2015</xref>). Intriguingly, a phenotype-based genetic association study revealed that MeCP2 protein levels in mice and <italic toggle=""yes"">MECP2</italic> single nucleotide polymorphisms in individuals with schizophrenia are associated with social aggression behaviors (<xref rid=""DMM050612C68"" ref-type=""bibr"">Tantra et al., 2014</xref>). Furthermore, studies in male mice with deletions or knockdown of either <italic toggle=""yes"">Bdnf</italic> or <italic toggle=""yes"">TrkB</italic> display enhanced aggressive phenotypes (<xref rid=""DMM050612C2"" ref-type=""bibr"">Adachi et al., 2017</xref>; <xref rid=""DMM050612C26"" ref-type=""bibr"">Ito et al., 2011</xref>; <xref rid=""DMM050612C39"" ref-type=""bibr"">Lyons et al., 1999</xref>), enhanced anxiety and have increased body weight (<xref rid=""DMM050612C58"" ref-type=""bibr"">Rios et al., 2001</xref>). Overall, our results demonstrate that female <italic toggle=""yes"">Mecp2</italic> HET mice may have altered aggression phenotypes, which should be further explored in deeper detailed in future studies. Genetic background also contributes significantly to behavioral phenotypes in RTT mice: female <italic toggle=""yes"">Mecp2</italic> HET mice bred into two different mixes of genetic strains, FVB/N×129S6/SvEv and 129S6/SvEv×C57BL/6, showed altered sociability, contextual fear memory and passive avoidance behaviors at 3 and 5 months of age, whereas at 4 months of age, they showed shorter distance traveled in the open field, suggestive of motor impairment (<xref rid=""DMM050612C62"" ref-type=""bibr"">Samaco et al., 2013</xref>). At 5 weeks of age, <italic toggle=""yes"">Mecp2</italic> HET mice spent more time in the open arm in the elevated plus maze test and greater time in the light side of the light-dark box assay (<xref rid=""DMM050612C62"" ref-type=""bibr"">Samaco et al., 2013</xref>). These data are further recapitulated by <italic toggle=""yes"">Mecp2</italic><sup>1lox</sup> mice spending more time in the open arms of the open-field apparatus as well as the open-zero maze at 8 weeks of age (<xref rid=""DMM050612C66"" ref-type=""bibr"">Stearns et al., 2007</xref>). All in all, the reduced anxiety phenotype of <italic toggle=""yes"">Mecp2</italic> HET mice is consistent among multiple studies, whereas aggressive behaviors in <italic toggle=""yes"">Mecp2</italic> KO males was also found to be a consistent behavioral phenotype, which was at large unexplored in female mice. Collectively, our observations indicate that sex, genotype and possibly genetic background are highly determinant for the presentation of behavioral phenotypes in MeCP2-based mouse models of RTT, and, therefore, these criteria should be included when defining the outcome measures used for characterizing the longitudinal progression of the disorder and the efficacy of therapeutic approaches.
