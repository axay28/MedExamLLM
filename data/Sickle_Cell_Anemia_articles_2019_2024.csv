Evaluation of Genes and Molecular Pathways Involved in Pathogenesis of Sickle Cell Anemia: A Bioinformatics Analysis and Future Perspective,,"Sickle cell disease (SCD) is an autosomal recessive genetic disorder characterized by a mutation in the globin chain. In SCD mutations occur in the gene encoding the β globin chain (<xref rid=""B1"" ref-type=""bibr"">1</xref>). About 176,000 people die each year from SCD complications. The clinical symptoms of the disease in patients are heterogeneous and vary from mild to severe, depending on whether the mutation occurs in one or two β globin chain genes (<xref rid=""B2"" ref-type=""bibr"">2</xref>, <xref rid=""B3"" ref-type=""bibr"">3</xref>). So far, many studies have been conducted in relation to the factors involved in the SCD pathogenesis; however, the main cause of the disease has not been identified. It is an inherited blood disorder caused by a genetic mutation. It affects hemoglobin, a protein that carries oxygen in red blood cells. The genetic factors responsible for the occurrence and progression of SCD have been extensively studied (<xref rid=""B4"" ref-type=""bibr"">4</xref>, <xref rid=""B5"" ref-type=""bibr"">5</xref>). The genetic mutation that causes SCD is a single nucleotide substitution that changes the amino acid sequence of the beta-globin gene. Individuals who inherit two copies of this mutated gene (one from each parent) develop SCD, while those who inherit only one copy are carriers of the disease (<xref rid=""B6"" ref-type=""bibr"">6</xref>, <xref rid=""B7"" ref-type=""bibr"">7</xref>). One of the main genetic factors that affect the progression of SCD is the type of hemoglobin that an individual produces. The mutated hemoglobin (HbS) is less stable than normal hemoglobin, leading it to form long, rigid fibers, causing red blood cells to become sickle-shaped (<xref rid=""B8"" ref-type=""bibr"">8</xref>). Variations in the <italic toggle=""yes"">HoxB5</italic> gene were associated with increased severity of SCD. Individuals with certain variations of the gene had more frequent pain crises and poorer lung function (<xref rid=""B5"" ref-type=""bibr"">5</xref>). A study identified a new genetic risk factor for SCD. Individuals with certain variations in the <italic toggle=""yes"">MYH9</italic> gene were more likely to develop SCD and have more severe disease. Other study found that genetic variations in the BCL11A gene were associated with a milder form of SCD. Individuals with certain variations of the gene had higher levels of fetal hemoglobin, which can help protect against the effects of SCD. Overall, these studies and others have helped to increase our understanding of the genetic factors that contribute to the occurrence and progression of SCD (<xref rid=""B5"" ref-type=""bibr"">5</xref>, <xref rid=""B9"" ref-type=""bibr"">9</xref>). Based on studies, in most cases family history and genetic factors lead to disease (<xref rid=""B10"" ref-type=""bibr"">10</xref>). On the other hand, some genes and molecular pathways are responsible for the occurrence and progression of the disease. Identifying these genes can be helpful in designing diagnostic panels and using preventive and therapeutic strategies (<xref rid=""B11"" ref-type=""bibr"">11</xref>, <xref rid=""B12"" ref-type=""bibr"">12</xref>). In this regard, systems biology approach is helpful (<xref rid=""B13"" ref-type=""bibr"">13</xref>, <xref rid=""B14"" ref-type=""bibr"">14</xref>). We aimed to provide valuable insights into the genetic basis of sickle cell disease and may pave the way for new treatments and therapies in the future.   Today, many attempts are made to identify the molecular targets that can modulate γ-globin expression including microRNAs that work via post-transcriptional gene regulation. Increasing the expression of miR-34a leads to increase the fetal hemoglobin levels consistent with silencing a repressor of the γ-globin gene. Furthermore, miR-34a promotes cell differentiation by increasing the expression of KLF1, glycophorin A, and erythropoietin receptors (<xref rid=""B15"" ref-type=""bibr"">15</xref>). MiR-34a is a tumor suppressor gene that is regulated through p53; it increases the production of HbF in cells. The high level of miR-34a expression causes induction of HbF production and reduces STAT3 phosphorylation in erythroid cells; this process results in the improvement of clinical signs and symptoms of SCA patients (<xref rid=""B15"" ref-type=""bibr"">15</xref>). Recent studies show the role of the transcription factor GATA-1, its cofactor FOG-1, and NuRD-associated chromatin remodeling complex in silencing HBG1 and HBG2 gene expression. Moreover, the hematopoietic transcription factor GATA-1 has been recommended to help globin genes silencing (<xref rid=""B16"" ref-type=""bibr"">16</xref>, <xref rid=""B17"" ref-type=""bibr"">17</xref>). Unexpectedly, NuRD is vital for FOG-1-based activation of adult globin gene expression in vivo (<xref rid=""B16"" ref-type=""bibr"">16</xref>). EPO receptor (EpoR) and GATA-1 signaling pathway regulate erythroid cells differentiation, proliferation, survival and maturation. Stimulation of EpoR through the PI3-kinase/AKT signaling pathway leads to GATA-1 phosphorylation in fetal erythroid liver progenitors, which is important for the induction of fetal erythroid cell maturation (<xref rid=""B18"" ref-type=""bibr"">18</xref>, <xref rid=""B19"" ref-type=""bibr"">19</xref>). The expression of nuclear factor-erythroid 2 (NFE2) is activated through CREB1 and inhibited via MYC. NFE2 is affected by 5 rSNPs (regulatory single nucleotide polymorphism), expected to disrupt numerous MYC motifs but do not affect CREB1 binding affinity (<xref rid=""B20"" ref-type=""bibr"">20</xref>). These rSNPs with altered MYC binding cause NFE2 overexpression, found in SCD patients; furthermore, elevated expression of NFE2 leads to the production of the pro-inflammatory cytokine IL-8 in myeloid cells and induces excessive neutrophil counts, and neutrophilia is related to SCA severity (<xref rid=""B21"" ref-type=""bibr"">21</xref>). Dysregulation of c-Myc and overexpression of hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) generally developed in a few malignancies. HIF inhibits c-Myc activity, but in hypoxic situations the oncogenic regulation of c-Myc via the HIF-1 signaling pathway performs a critical role in adapting to the tumorigenic microenvironment (<xref rid=""B22"" ref-type=""bibr"">22</xref>). HIF influences the secretion of VEGF and angiogenic activity within the bone marrow microenvironment. Similarly, in hypoxemic situations like SCA the proliferation of endothelium cells leads to more severity of disease (<xref rid=""B22"" ref-type=""bibr"">22</xref>). Renal problem is one of the most dangerous complications in sickle cell anemia patients (<xref rid=""B23"" ref-type=""bibr"">23</xref>, <xref rid=""B24"" ref-type=""bibr"">24</xref>). <italic toggle=""yes"">TOP2A</italic> (DNA Topoisomerase II Alpha) is a nuclear enzyme that controls DNA topological shape and cell cycle (<xref rid=""B25"" ref-type=""bibr"">25</xref>). The increase in <italic toggle=""yes"">TOP2A</italic> expression leads to increased proliferation and reduction of its expression via the activation of the ERK/JNK/p-P38/CHOP signaling pathway causing improvement of the disease (<xref rid=""B26"" ref-type=""bibr"">26</xref>, <xref rid=""B27"" ref-type=""bibr"">27</xref>). The protein encoded through <italic toggle=""yes"">SLC4A1</italic> (solute carrier family 4 members 1) is a part of the anion exchanger (AE) own family and is expressed within the plasma membrane of erythrocytes, it acts as a chloride/bicarbonate exchanger involved in the delivery of carbon dioxide from the lungs. This protein contains areas that might be structurally and functionally distinct. The N-terminal area of 40 kDa is positioned within the cytoplasm and binds to the red blood cell skeleton (<xref rid=""B28"" ref-type=""bibr"">28</xref>). Many mutations in this gene were recognized, which result in the instability of the red blood cell membrane and defective kidney acid secretion, and distal renal tubular acidosis (<xref rid=""B29"" ref-type=""bibr"">29</xref>). -lnc-<italic toggle=""yes"">SLC4A1</italic>-1 alters trophoblast function by activating the immune responses and via regulating the NF-k B/CXCL8 axis. lnc-<italic toggle=""yes"">SLC4A1</italic>-1 recruits NF-kB and binds to the CXCL8 promoter, resulting in expanded CXCL8 activity. Increased CXCL8 activity exacerbates the inflammatory response and impacts trophoblast characteristics by inducing TNF-α and IL-1, which may also have an effect on the immune responses and ultimately results in pregnancy loss because of placental vascular modifications (<xref rid=""B30"" ref-type=""bibr"">30</xref>). This inflammatory response and vascular modifications may additionally play a role in the pathogenesis of SCA (<xref rid=""B30"" ref-type=""bibr"">30</xref>). Denticleless E3 Ubiquitin Protein Ligase Homolog (<italic toggle=""yes"">DTL</italic>) expression causes infiltration of type 2 T helper cells and memory B cells and inversely is associated with the infiltration of memory CD4+ T cells and macrophages. Furthermore, <italic toggle=""yes"">DTL</italic> gene transcription levels have been associated with markers of CD8+ T cells, T cells (general), monocytes, DC cells, Treg cells, and T cell exhaustion (<xref rid=""B31"" ref-type=""bibr"">31</xref>). CD8+ T cells release Perforin and Granzyme B via the Fas/FasL pathway and release IFN-g and TNFa, which play a protective role in the immune system. Besides, patients with excessive <italic toggle=""yes"">DTL</italic> expression may benefit more in prolongation of overall survival from treatment with checkpoint inhibitors (<xref rid=""B31"" ref-type=""bibr"">31</xref>, <xref rid=""B32"" ref-type=""bibr"">32</xref>). Likely, the accumulation of inflammatory CD8+ T cells aggravate the signs and symptoms of the disease (<xref rid=""B32"" ref-type=""bibr"">32</xref>). <italic toggle=""yes"">DTL</italic> is also called retinoic acid-regulated nuclear matrix-related protein (RAMP) or DNA replication factor 2 (CDT2). It is related to the cell proliferation, cell cycle arrest, and cell invasion. <italic toggle=""yes"">DTL</italic> functions as a key regulator of the cell cycle and genomic stability. It is also a substrate receptor for the CRL4 ubiquitin ligase (<xref rid=""B33"" ref-type=""bibr"">33</xref>). Together with the substrate receptor <italic toggle=""yes"">DTL</italic>, it causes the CRL4 ubiquitin ligase-based degradation of numerous proteins and is crucial for cell cycle progression as well as for DNA replication and repair. <italic toggle=""yes"">DTL</italic> expression level is known as a prognostic biomarker in diseases (<xref rid=""B33"" ref-type=""bibr"">33</xref>). Elevated expression of <italic toggle=""yes"">DTL</italic> is associated with the activation and infiltration of M1 macrophages, neutrophils, and CD4+ memory T cells. It has an inverse relationship with the activation of memory B cells. Neutrophil infiltration in SCA disease might be related to more severity of the disease and signs and symptoms associated with vascular occlusion (<xref rid=""B33"" ref-type=""bibr"">33</xref>). <italic toggle=""yes"">DTL</italic> is a new goal of T-cell-mediated auto-immune or inflammatory sicknesses, as its complex is an essential mediator controlling M-phase exit in the activated T cells (<xref rid=""B34"" ref-type=""bibr"">34</xref>). The higher the expression of <italic toggle=""yes"">DTL</italic>, the more the decrease in the protein level of genes including PDCD4, NKX2-1, and PRKAA1. Notably, PDCD4 acts through inhibiting PI3K/Akt, MAPK, and TGF-beta signaling pathways (<xref rid=""B35"" ref-type=""bibr"">35</xref>). Erythrocyte Membrane Protein Band four.2 (<italic toggle=""yes"">EPB42</italic>) an ATP-binding protein performs a vital role in conserving the structural integrity of the cytoskeleton protein ankyrin within the red blood cell membrane. Insufficient level of <italic toggle=""yes"">EPB42</italic> results in anemia and hemolysis. The integrity of the red blood cell membrane can deliver sufficient oxygen to the skeletal muscle, which facilitates exercise ability increment in vascular diseases (<xref rid=""B35"" ref-type=""bibr"">35</xref>). This gene is specifically involved in cytokine and cytokine receptors, signaling pathways, IL-17, and TLR. TLR7 is extensively expressed in respiratory system including epithelial cells and smooth muscle cells. TLR7 together with the TLR signaling pathway performs a crucial role in the innate and adaptive immune response and may motivate the production of inflammatory cytokines (<xref rid=""B36"" ref-type=""bibr"">36</xref>). This problem might be associated with the velocity of disease progression and the exacerbation of signs and symptoms in vascular occlusion crisis in patients with sickle cell anemia (<xref rid=""B36"" ref-type=""bibr"">36</xref>). <italic toggle=""yes"">EPB42</italic> and SCL4A1 may also play a functional role in the incidence and development of ISR (instent restenosis), however, there is still inadequate research on this subject (<xref rid=""B21"" ref-type=""bibr"">21</xref>, <xref rid=""B37"" ref-type=""bibr"">37</xref>). According to current studies, these genes are impressive in the composition of maturation, stability, cell transport, and diffusion of hemoglobin in red blood cells (<xref rid=""B37"" ref-type=""bibr"">37</xref>). It has been proven down expression of <italic toggle=""yes"">EPB42</italic> and <italic toggle=""yes"">SLC4A1</italic> genes leads to hemolysis, an increase in blood viscosity followed by an increase in blood flow resistance and a decrease in blood flow velocity, which results in ischemia, hypoxia, and the accumulation of numerous metabolites within the tissue. It could be one of the mechanisms leading to ISR, which leads to SCA severity and vascular occlusions crisis via vascular blockage caused by endothelial destruction (<xref rid=""B20"" ref-type=""bibr"">20</xref>). α-synuclein (<italic toggle=""yes"">SNCA</italic>) is expressed and secreted in endothelial cells (ECs). <italic toggle=""yes"">SNCA</italic> levels are correlated with blood pressure and age, suggesting the involvement of <italic toggle=""yes"">SNCA</italic> in age-related endothelial disorder (<xref rid=""B37"" ref-type=""bibr"">37</xref>). Exogenous treatment with recombinant <italic toggle=""yes"">SNCA</italic> (r<italic toggle=""yes"">SNCA</italic>) activates the Akt-eNOS axis and elevates the nitric oxide (NO) production in ECs. Treatment with r<italic toggle=""yes"">SNCA</italic> additionally suppressed TNF-α- and palmitic acid-triggered NF-kB activation, leading to suppression of vascular cell adhesion molecule1 (VCAM-1) and restoration of reduced eNOS expression in ECs. <italic toggle=""yes"">SNCA</italic> silencing results in reduced eNOS, increased β-gal activity, decreased Sirt1 expression, and elevated expression of the p53 signaling pathway in ECs, impairs normal endothelial integrity and function (<xref rid=""B37"" ref-type=""bibr"">37</xref>). Exogenous and endogenous <italic toggle=""yes"">SNCA</italic> in ECs can also physiologically preserve vascular integrity, and age-related endothelial disorder can be in part resulting from the lack of <italic toggle=""yes"">SNCA</italic> function in ECs (<xref rid=""B28"" ref-type=""bibr"">28</xref>). Likely, endothelial disorder performs a role in the pathogenesis of SCA with the same mechanism (<xref rid=""B20"" ref-type=""bibr"">20</xref>). In general, evaluation of hub genes in SCD can be used as a diagnostic panel to detect high-risk patients.Following genes were considered as the hub genes including, <italic toggle=""yes"">SLC4A1</italic>, <italic toggle=""yes"">DTL</italic>, <italic toggle=""yes"">EPB42</italic>, <italic toggle=""yes"">SNCA</italic>, and TOP2A. In addition, by identifying the UP and Down stream pathways, treatment strategies can be designed in the monitoring and treatment of patients. In future studies, we suggest more emphasis on understanding the precise molecular pathways and mechanisms that contribute to SCD pathogenesis. This can be achieved using advanced genomics, proteomics, and bioinformatics techniques. Furthermore, it is important to identify environmental and lifestyle factors that contribute to SCD incidence and progression. Future studies focused on understanding these mechanisms and identifying new therapeutic targets will be crucial in improving the clinical management of this disease and ultimately finding a cure.

Changes in indicators of cerebral metabolic stress following treatment with voxelotor in children and adolescents with sickle cell anemia,"Voxelotor is a small molecule that reduces the polymerization of sickle hemoglobin by increasing its affinity for oxygen. In patients with sickle cell anemia, it has been postulated that increasing hemoglobin‐oxygen affinity could limit oxygen offloading from hemoglobin, causing an increase in cerebral metabolic stress. To investigate this hypothetical concern, we used multimodal brain imaging to define the effects of voxelotor on cerebral blood flow and oxygen extraction. We followed four patients for 2–5 months during and/or after voxelotor therapy. This study showed no observable increase in cerebral blood flow or oxygen extraction fraction during treatment.","Sickle cell anemia (SCA) is an inherited hematological disorder caused by a glutamic acid to valine substitution in beta‐globin which results in sickling of red cells. Repetitive ischemic injury and inflammation caused by anemia and hemolysis result in progressive end‐organ damage, including the brain. Patients with SCA are at risk of stroke and silent cerebral infarcts (SCI) [<xref rid=""jha21001-bib-0001"" ref-type=""bibr"">1</xref>], which are associated with significant cognitive decline [<xref rid=""jha21001-bib-0002"" ref-type=""bibr"">2</xref>]. Brain infarcts occur in SCA due to increased cerebral metabolic stress [<xref rid=""jha21001-bib-0003"" ref-type=""bibr"">3</xref>]. Both cerebral blood flow (CBF) and oxygen extraction fraction (OEF) are elevated in SCA due to reduced arterial oxygen content (CaO<sub>2</sub>) [<xref rid=""jha21001-bib-0003"" ref-type=""bibr"">3</xref>]. CBF and CaO<sub>2</sub> encompass cerebral oxygen delivery, and OEF quantifies the transfer of available oxygen supply into the brain tissue. Ischemia occurs when the cerebral metabolic rate of oxygen utilization does not meet metabolic demands. Current treatment options for SCA remain limited, with hydroxyurea being the primary disease‐modifying therapy. Chronic red blood cell transfusions are effective for primary stroke prevention in the setting of elevated transcranial Doppler velocities and for secondary stroke prevention [<xref rid=""jha21001-bib-0004"" ref-type=""bibr"">4</xref>]. Hydroxyurea may also reduce stroke risk [<xref rid=""jha21001-bib-0005"" ref-type=""bibr"">5</xref>]. Chronic transfusions reduce global CBF and OEF [<xref rid=""jha21001-bib-0006"" ref-type=""bibr"">6</xref>], and hydroxyurea reduces whole‐brain OEF [<xref rid=""jha21001-bib-0007"" ref-type=""bibr"">7</xref>]. Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation and gene therapy have emerged as potentially curative options for SCA and are known to reduce CBF and OEF to levels consistent with same‐age peers without SCA [<xref rid=""jha21001-bib-0008"" ref-type=""bibr"">8</xref>]. However, stem cell transplantation and gene therapy are accessible only to a small number of patients with severe disease complications. In 2019, Oxbryta (voxelotor), was approved for the treatment of SCA patients ≥ 12 years of age and use was expanded to patients 4 to < 12 years of age in 2022. Voxelotor is a first‐in‐class, small molecule that reduces the polymerization of sickle hemoglobin by increasing its affinity for oxygen [<xref rid=""jha21001-bib-0009"" ref-type=""bibr"">9</xref>]. This results in decreased hemolysis and an increase in hemoglobin. However, it has been postulated that increasing hemoglobin‐oxygen affinity could limit oxygen offloading from hemoglobin, thus impairing tissue oxygenation [<xref rid=""jha21001-bib-0010"" ref-type=""bibr"">10</xref>]. There have been safety concerns that decreased oxygen delivery to the brain, may increase stroke risk [<xref rid=""jha21001-bib-0011"" ref-type=""bibr"">11</xref>]. To date, no adverse neurologic events have been reported from clinical trials [<xref rid=""jha21001-bib-0012"" ref-type=""bibr"">12</xref>]. A recent study using optical spectroscopies suggested that OEF and CBF decreased with voxelotor [<xref rid=""jha21001-bib-0013"" ref-type=""bibr"">13</xref>]. To further examine the potential effects of voxelotor on cerebral metabolic stress, we used multimodal brain imaging to define the effects of voxelotor therapy on grey matter CBF and OEF in children and adolescents with SCA. Data were collected during a clinical study to evaluate the use of voxelotor in children and adolescents (NCT02850406, HOPE Kids). St. Jude enrolled 16 participants in the HOPE Kids trial, and four of those patients received multimodal neuroimaging as part of a separate study. Study activities were IRB‐approved, and all participants provided informed consent. Four children with SCA underwent multimodal brain imaging on a 3T Siemens magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scanner utilizing a multi‐channel head coil. Conventional anatomical MRI included 3D sagittal T1, T2, and 2D axial fluid attenuation inversion recovery (FLAIR) T2 images of the whole brain. Susceptibility‐weighted imaging (SWI) and quantitative susceptibility mapping were obtained from the magnitude and phase images of a 3D SWI sequence and were used to estimate OEF. Arterial spin labeling MRI was used to obtain perfusion‐weighted images and to calculate resting state CBF. All MRI data was collected between May 2017 and June 2019. Post eligibility screening, consenting, and enrollment into the HOPE Kids clinical trial (NCT02850406), each participant received a baseline MRI evaluation, within 4 weeks before treatment with voxelotor, and two follow‐up MRI evaluations. The second MRI evaluation occurred 40–151 days after treatment began (see Figure <xref rid=""jha21001-fig-0001"" ref-type=""fig"">1</xref>). Participant 3 discontinued voxelotor 7 days prior to the 2nd MRI and 118 days prior to the 3rd MRI. Participants 1 and 2 underwent a third MRI evaluation post‐discontinuation of voxelotor, whereas participant 4 remained on voxelotor through all three MRI evaluations. Laboratory parameters, including total hemoglobin and daytime oxygen saturation, were collected on the day of each MRI evaluation. Table <xref rid=""jha21001-tbl-0001"" ref-type=""table"">1</xref> displays demographic characteristics, lab values, CBF, and OEF of the four participants at baseline and following treatment with voxelotor. At baseline, participants’ ages ranged from 10.3 to 17.1 years. All participants were Black/African American, two participants were female, and two were male. Three participants had the HbSS genotype, and one had HbSB<sup>0</sup>. Three of the four patients received a stable hydroxyurea dose at baseline and during all MRI/MRA evaluations (Participants 1, 2, and 3). One patient (Participant 4) was not treated with hydroxyurea during the study. No patient had a history of stroke or experienced a stroke during the study. Transcranial Doppler velocities were within the normal range (< 170 cm/s) at baseline and during treatment for all patients. Baseline CBF as measured by MRI (range = 96–134 mL/100 g/min) was elevated compared to healthy same‐age peers [<xref rid=""jha21001-bib-0014"" ref-type=""bibr"">14</xref>]. Figure <xref rid=""jha21001-fig-0001"" ref-type=""fig"">1</xref> and Table <xref rid=""jha21001-tbl-0001"" ref-type=""table"">1</xref> display changes in total hemoglobin, CBF, and OEF following treatment with voxelotor. Three of four patients displayed an increase in hemoglobin during treatment. Three of four patients displayed a decrease in CBF, and all four displayed a decrease in OEF during treatment. The only patient that did not display an initial decrease in CBF (Participant 4), subsequently showed a return to near baseline at his final MRI. After stopping treatment with voxelotor, all three patients displayed an increase in CBF. OEF increased for Participant 3 and slightly decreased for Participant 2 post‐treatment. Voxelotor is a first‐in‐class, small molecule that increases the affinity of hemoglobin for oxygen and thereby inhibits sickle hemoglobin polymerization. Given its mechanism of action, it has been postulated that voxelotor may impair tissue oxygenation and lead to an increase in CBF [<xref rid=""jha21001-bib-0010"" ref-type=""bibr"">10</xref>]. Our data from all four patients followed for 2–5 months during voxelotor treatment did not display worsening metrics of cerebral metabolic stress (CBF and OEF) while treated with voxelotor. Intriguingly, cerebral tissue oxygenation potentially worsened (as measured by increased CBF) in three patients after discontinuation of voxelotor, which was not associated with worsening anemia. The mechanisms underlying this potential finding are not clear; however, increases in hemoglobin with other disease‐modifying therapies are associated with decreases in CBF and OEF [<xref rid=""jha21001-bib-0006"" ref-type=""bibr"">6</xref>, <xref rid=""jha21001-bib-0007"" ref-type=""bibr"">7</xref>, <xref rid=""jha21001-bib-0008"" ref-type=""bibr"">8</xref>]. The in vivo effect of increased oxygen affinity, decreased hemolysis, and increased hemoglobin with voxelotor may be linked to the reduction in CBF and OEF but other unaccounted physiologic changes with therapy may also be contributing factors [<xref rid=""jha21001-bib-0012"" ref-type=""bibr"">12</xref>]. Recently, studies presented longitudinal data assessing CBF or other markers of neurovascular function following voxelotor treatment. One study demonstrated stable CBF and reduced OEF at 3‐month follow‐up using MRI (<italic toggle=""yes"">n</italic> = 15) [<xref rid=""jha21001-bib-0015"" ref-type=""bibr"">15</xref>]. The second study found significant decreases in OEF and CBF 4 weeks after treatment with voxelotor using diffuse optical spectroscopy. These changes persisted in weeks 8 and 12 (<italic toggle=""yes"">n</italic> = 8) [<xref rid=""jha21001-bib-0013"" ref-type=""bibr"">13</xref>]. Building off this prior work, we followed patients for up to 5 months after treatment initiation and captured changes in cerebral metabolic stress after discontinuation of voxelotor in three of four patients. Our findings are consistent with these reports, as we observed a decrease in OEF for all patients and a decrease in CBF for three of four patients after voxelotor was initiated. The small sample and inconsistent timing of data collection limit conclusions that can be drawn from the current case series. However, our findings are not consistent with the hypothesis that voxelotor significantly impairs oxygen transfer to the brain. Rather, consistent with prior work, CBF and OEF appear to decrease slightly following voxelotor treatment and may increase after stopping treatment. Cognitive endpoints are needed to determine the functional consequences of these cerebrovascular changes. Larger studies and further investigation are required to better characterize the effects on stroke risk in SCA. Andrew M. Heitzer—Consultant Fees: Global Blood Therapeutics.

Opioid Control for Patients With Sickle Cell Anemia in Emergency Departments in the Western Region of Saudi Arabia,"Introduction Sickle cell anemia (SCA) affects the Saudi Arabian population significantly, with 4.2% carriers and 0.26% affected. Vaso-occlusive crises cause severe pain due to blood vessel blockage by sickled cells, leading to frequent emergency visits, where treatment includes the use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), oxygen, and opioids. This study examines opioid use in managing SCA crises in Saudi emergency departments. Method A retrospective cross-sectional study in western Saudi Arabia surveyed board-certified emergency physicians (consultants, fellows, specialists) via the Sickle Cell Disease Implementation Consortium (SCDIC). Non-board-certified physicians and general practitioners were excluded. Data were gathered through structured surveys and supplemented by interviews. Results The study included 53 emergency physicians, mostly specialists (60.4%), with one to three years' experience, primarily from King Abdul Aziz University Hospital (28.3%) and King Abdullah Medical Complex (22.6%). While more than half of the participants felt adequately trained for SCA management, 20.8% faced challenges referring patients to case management programs. Major barriers included department overcrowding and the opioid epidemic. Conclusion The study reveals challenges in managing SCA in Saudi emergency departments, particularly with opioid use. Despite physician training, gaps in administrative support, medication access, and follow-up care persist. Institutional policies and opioid epidemic concerns restrict Schedule-II opioid prescriptions. Implementing a comprehensive opioid administration tracking system and standardizing protocols are crucial for enhancing patient outcomes. Future efforts should focus on improving resources and inter-institutional collaboration.","Sickle cell anemia (SCA) is a hereditary blood disorder that imposes a significant burden on millions worldwide. In Saudi Arabia, the carrier rate for the sickle cell trait is reported to be 4.2%, with 0.26% of the population being affected by sickle cell disease (SCD) [<xref rid=""REF1"" ref-type=""bibr"">1</xref>]. Among the various complications of SCA, sickle cell crisis, or vaso-occlusive crisis (VOC), is particularly challenging, as it is characterized by painful episodes that occur due to the occlusion of blood vessels by sickled cells, prompting patients to seek relief in emergency departments (EDs). Depending on the severity of pain and other factors, patients may be admitted to hospitals or managed on an outpatient basis. Management protocols typically involve the administration of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), oxygen therapy, and opioids [<xref rid=""REF2"" ref-type=""bibr"">2</xref>]. This study focuses on opioid usage in EDs to assist SCA patients in pain management. Despite opioids being a cornerstone in the management of acute exacerbations of SCD, emergency physicians often struggle to address patients’ pain adequately due to the absence of definitive physical examination findings [<xref rid=""REF3"" ref-type=""bibr"">3</xref>]. Moreover, the use of opioids in SCA management is hindered by prevailing stigma and concerns regarding addiction, compounded by the frequent and sequential dosing patterns observed in emergency settings. These apprehensions are exacerbated by the potential adverse effects of opioids, including excessive sedation, respiratory depression, addiction, and the development of tolerance to the drug [<xref rid=""REF4"" ref-type=""bibr"">4</xref>]. This study aims to evaluate the efficacy of opioid use in EDs to assist pain management in SCA patients. It advocates for the implementation of a comprehensive program accessible across all EDs to track patients’ opioid administrations, including dosage and timing. This approach aims to empower physicians with pertinent data to facilitate informed decision-making regarding opioid administration and potentially prompt the consideration of alternative treatments to mitigate the risk of opioid-related complications while ensuring optimal pain management for patients with SCA [<xref rid=""REF5"" ref-type=""bibr"">5</xref>]. Study design and period This retrospective cross-sectional study included board-certified emergency physicians (consultants, fellows, and specialists) practicing in the western region of Saudi Arabia. The study was conducted from October 2023 to March 2024. This duration was determined by logistical considerations, participant availability, and data collection requirements, ensuring an adequate sample size and comprehensive data collection. Inclusion and exclusion criteria Board-certified emergency physicians (consultants, fellows, and specialists) practicing in the western region of Saudi Arabia were included in the study. Non-board-certified emergency physicians, emergency physicians not practicing in the western region of Saudi Arabia, and general practitioners in EDs were excluded from the study. Data collection tool A structured survey developed by the Sickle Cell Disease Implementation Consortium (SCDIC) was used to collect data for this study [<xref rid=""REF6"" ref-type=""bibr"">6</xref>]. This validated survey tool is designed to gather comprehensive information on opioid management practices in the ED setting for patients with SCA. Data collection technique Data were collected through a combination of interviews and surveys. Participants were approached for interviews, during which they were provided with the survey link to complete electronically. Interviews were conducted to gain additional insights and clarification regarding opioid management practices in EDs. Data entry and analysis Data were initially recorded in Microsoft Excel (Microsoft Corp., Redmond, WA) and then analyzed using the Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS) Version 25.0 (IBM Corp., Armonk, NY). Descriptive statistics were used, with categorical data presented as frequencies (n) and percentages (%), and numeric data presented as means and standard deviations (SD). For inferential statistics, chi-square and Fisher’s exact tests were used. A p-value of <0.05 was considered significant. Ethical considerations Ethical approval for this study was obtained from the Bioethics Committee for Scientific and Medical Research at the University of Jeddah (approval number UJ-REC-153). Informed consent was obtained from all the participants, ensuring their voluntary participation, confidentiality, and anonymity. The study adhered to the ethical guidelines outlined in the Declaration of Helsinki and other applicable regulations. By following this methodology, the study aims to comprehensively evaluate opioid management practices followed by board-certified emergency physicians in the western region of Saudi Arabia, contributing valuable insights to improve patient care and outcomes. Baseline characteristics of study participants This study included a total of 53 participants. The majority of them were specialists (N= 32, 60.4%), followed by consultants (N= 19, 35.8%), and, lastly, fellows (N= 2, 3.8%). The period of clinical experience varied, with most participants having one to three years of experience; 18.9% had one year of experience, 17% had three years of experience, and 15.1% had two years of experience. Doctors working at King Abdulaziz University Hospital, Jeddah, constituted the largest group of respondents (28.3%), followed by those working at King Abdullah Medical Complex, Jeddah (22.6%), as shown in Table <xref rid=""TAB1"" ref-type=""table"">1</xref>. Practice characteristics As shown in Table <xref rid=""TAB2"" ref-type=""table"">2</xref>, more than half of the doctors (54.7%) who participated in the study strongly agreed that they have the knowledge to provide care to patients with SCD. A slightly higher percentage (56.6%) strongly agreed that they have the training to deliver care to patients with SCD. An equal percentage (49.1%) agreed or strongly agreed that they have the administrative support required to treat patients with SCD. Additionally, 50.9% agreed that they have access to the necessary medications. Furthermore, 43.4% agreed that they have the ability to fix a follow-up appointment for their patients with a sickle cell specialist following discharge. A slightly lesser percentage (41.5%) agreed that they have the ability to fix such an appointment for their patients with a primary care provider. However, 20.8% disagreed on being able to refer patients to a case management program upon discharge. More than half (54.7%) of the participants agreed that they work in an ED with sufficient nurse staffing to provide good pain management to patients with SCD, while 67.9% agreed that physician/provider staffing is sufficient. Additionally, 58.5% agreed that nursing staff ratios allow the ED to provide safe care, and 54.7% agreed that these ratios allow the ED to provide high-quality care. Lastly, 41.5% agreed that patients’ underinsurance or lack of insurance does not affect their ability to provide good care. More than two-thirds (69.8%) agreed that the workflow in the ED is conducive to providing high-quality care for patients in sickle cell pain crises. Care provision and adherence to the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) recommendations and opioid prescribing patterns As shown in Table <xref rid=""TAB3"" ref-type=""table"">3</xref>, 39.6% of the respondents mentioned that they do not prescribe Schedule-II medications (i.e., opioid analgesics) to patients who request them upon discharge, with 40% citing that they were not allowed to do so. Additionally, 75.5% stated that they had protocols for treating sickle cell pain in the ED, and 62.3% stated that they use individualized dosing protocols. The majority (79.2%) were aware of the Ministry of Health (MOH) recommendations for the treatment of VOC, and 77.4% mentioned that they rely on the patient’s medical history for the diagnosis of SCD. However, 83% mentioned that they do not have access to a system that provides a confirmed diagnosis of SCD if the patient was diagnosed at another center, and 84.9% stated that they could not contact the diagnosing doctor at another center to discuss the patient’s status. Of the participants, 66% agreed that having records of patient doses of opioids would affect their management plan and 81.1% said that they would use alternative drugs or lower the dosage of opioids if the patient had been recently administered opioids during a VOC. All participants (100%) believe that there is a need to implement a system that documents records of opioid dosing for SCD patients that is accessible by every center in the region. Barriers to care The participants reported that overcrowding was the most common barrier hindering their treatment of patients with SCD in the ED, followed by the opioid epidemic (43.4%). Administrative support and lack of medical equipment were the least reported causes (7.5% each). Factors associated with awareness of the MOH recommendations for the treatment of VOC As shown in Table <xref rid=""TAB4"" ref-type=""table"">4</xref>, a significant difference was observed between centers in applying individualized dosing protocols to treat SCD pain (P < 0.05), while no difference was found between different centers in having ED protocols to treat SCD pain. The findings of this study underscore the complexities and challenges associated with the management of SCA, particularly in the context of EDs in the western region of Saudi Arabia. The findings reveal that while the majority of emergency physicians possess the requisite knowledge and training to provide care to individuals with SCD, there are significant gaps in administrative support, access to medications, and the ability to facilitate follow-up appointments with specialists or primary care providers [<xref rid=""REF7"" ref-type=""bibr"">7</xref>]. These gaps may contribute to the suboptimal management of SCD patients during VOCs, potentially leading to increased morbidity and healthcare use [<xref rid=""REF8"" ref-type=""bibr"">8</xref>]. The reluctance to prescribe Schedule-II opioid analgesics upon discharge, cited by nearly 40% of the respondents as a barrier due to institutional policies or fear of contributing to the opioid epidemic, highlights the tension between the need for effective pain management and concerns over opioid misuse. This tension is further exacerbated by the lack of a unified system to track opioid dosing across different healthcare centers, which could help in making informed decisions regarding pain management [<xref rid=""REF9"" ref-type=""bibr"">9</xref>,<xref rid=""REF10"" ref-type=""bibr"">10</xref>]. More than half of the respondents agreed on the need for individualized dosing protocols for treating SCD pain, yet only 62.3% reported using such protocols. This suggests a discrepancy between the recognition of best practices and their implementation. This discrepancy may be due to various factors, including the lack of resources, insufficient training, or other administrative barriers [<xref rid=""REF11"" ref-type=""bibr"">11</xref>,<xref rid=""REF12"" ref-type=""bibr"">12</xref>]. The significant difference observed in the application of individualized dosing protocols across different centers underscores the variability in the quality of care provided to SCD patients. This variability may be due to differences in institutional policies, the availability of resources, or the level of expertise among healthcare providers [<xref rid=""REF13"" ref-type=""bibr"">13</xref>]. The lack of significant association between the basic characteristics of participants and awareness of MOH recommendations for the treatment of VOCs indicates that awareness of these guidelines is widespread, regardless of clinical experience or position. However, the gap between awareness and adherence to these recommendations in practice suggests a need for targeted interventions to improve guideline implementation. The study’s limitations include its reliance on self-reported data, which may be subject to recall bias or social desirability bias. Additionally, the study’s focus on emergency physicians practicing in the western region of Saudi Arabia may limit the generalizability of its findings to other regions or healthcare settings. Other limitations include a small sample size and the retrospective nature of the study, which may affect the robustness of the results. This study highlights the significant challenges faced by emergency physicians in managing SCA in the western region of Saudi Arabia, particularly concerning opioid use. While physicians possess the necessary knowledge to treat pain crises, gaps in administrative support, access to medications, and follow-up care persist. The reluctance to prescribe Schedule-II opioids due to institutional policies underscores the need for a balanced approach to pain management. Future efforts should focus on standardizing treatment protocols and improving resource availability to enhance patient care.",N/A,12 9 2024
The Association Between Sickle Cell Anemia and Cognitive Dysfunction: A Systematic Review,"A kind of hemoglobinopathy known as sickle cell anemia (SCA) is characterized by aberrant hemoglobin molecules. The most frequent neurological side effects linked to SCA include neurocognitive dysfunction, asymptomatic cerebral infarction, and ischemic stroke. This study aims to investigate the relationship between SCA and cognitive dysfunction. We systematically searched electronic databases like PubMed, MEDLINE, Science Direct, and Scopus. Two independent reviewers screened and extracted data from eligible studies. Eighteen studies, including 2,457 participants in total and nearly half of them 1,151 (46.8%) were males, were included in our data. The prevalence of cognitive dysfunction in the adult population ranged from 11.5% to 70%. Cognitive dysfunction among adults was significantly associated with poorer educational status, reduced family income, decreased kidney function, older age, stroke history, and vasculopathy. The prevalence of cognitive dysfunction in children ranged from 10.2% to 68.2%. The decline in cognitive function among adults was significantly associated with children over the age of four, abnormal transcranial Doppler and previous stroke, school absence, age beyond 13, and increased BMI. Cognitive function deficiencies are a defining feature of SCA that affects people of all ages. These findings suggest that if cognitive decline is not slowed down, or better still, stopped, medical interventions targeting a variety of sequelae in this population will be ineffective. Future analyses of this population's cognition should evaluate the environmental and other biological variables.","Sickle cell anemia (SCA) is a hereditary condition that alters red blood cell structure. The protein that carries oxygen in the blood, hemoglobin, is produced by a mutation in the hemoglobin gene. Red blood cells in people with SCA are not round but resemble crescent moons. Red blood cells with this aberrant shape may become lodged in tiny blood vessels, resulting in discomfort, organ damage, and other issues [<xref rid=""REF1"" ref-type=""bibr"">1</xref>]. In recent years, researchers have begun to investigate the potential link between SCA and cognitive dysfunction. Cognitive dysfunction refers to difficulties with thinking, learning, and memory that can impact a person's ability to perform everyday tasks. This area of research is important because it could help to better understand the full range of complications associated with SCA, and potentially lead to new treatments to improve cognitive function in affected individuals [<xref rid=""REF2"" ref-type=""bibr"">2</xref>]. Numerous investigations have discovered proof linking SCA to cognitive impairment. For instance, compared to children in good health, children with SCA scored lower on cognitive function tests, according to a study that was published in the journal Pediatrics. The scientists hypothesized that this might be caused by SCA's effects on the brain, which include decreased oxygen and blood flow [<xref rid=""REF3"" ref-type=""bibr"">3</xref>]. According to other research, people with SCA have a higher chance of having a stroke, which can harm the brain and impair cognitive function. Stroke is really one of the most frequent neurological side effects of SCA, affecting up to 10% of individuals by the time they are 20 years old [<xref rid=""REF4"" ref-type=""bibr"">4</xref>]. There exist multiple plausible pathways via which SCA may result in cognitive impairment. One theory is that the aberrant morphology of the red blood cells may restrict blood flow to the brain, which would reduce the amount of nutrients and oxygen that are delivered. This might lead to disruption of neuronal circuits and injury to brain cells, which would impair cognitive function [<xref rid=""REF5"" ref-type=""bibr"">5</xref>]. Another potential mechanism is inflammation. Individuals with SCA have higher levels of inflammation in their bodies, which has been linked to cognitive dysfunction in other conditions such as Alzheimer's disease. Chronic inflammation can lead to oxidative stress and damage to brain cells, contributing to cognitive impairment [<xref rid=""REF6"" ref-type=""bibr"">6</xref>]. Currently, there is no specific treatment for cognitive dysfunction in individuals with SCA. However, several strategies can help to manage the condition and improve cognitive function. These may include cognitive rehabilitation programs, educational support, and interventions to address other complications of SCA that could impact cognitive function such as stroke or pain [<xref rid=""REF4"" ref-type=""bibr"">4</xref>]. In addition, ongoing research is exploring potential new treatments for cognitive dysfunction in SCA. For example, some studies have suggested that medications targeting inflammation or oxidative stress could help to protect the brain and improve cognitive function in affected individuals. Other research is focused on understanding the underlying mechanisms of cognitive dysfunction in SCA, which could lead to the development of more targeted therapies in the future [<xref rid=""REF6"" ref-type=""bibr"">6</xref>]. Understanding the association between SCA and cognitive dysfunction has significant implications for both healthcare providers and individuals living with SCA. By clarifying this relationship, the study can contribute to the development of targeted interventions and support strategies to address cognitive impairment in these individuals. This can ultimately improve the quality of life and overall well-being of individuals with SCA, as cognitive impairment can impact daily functioning, educational attainment, and employment opportunities. Despite the well-documented effects of SCA on physical health, there is a lack of comprehensive understanding of its potential impact on cognitive function. This knowledge gap hinders the implementation of effective interventions and support systems for individuals with SCA who may be experiencing cognitive dysfunction. The aim of this study is to conduct a systematic review to consolidate existing evidence and determine the association between SCA and cognitive dysfunction. By synthesizing the available research, this study seeks to enhance our understanding of the relationship between SCA and cognitive impairment. Methods Search Strategy Our systematic review was carried out in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) criteria in July 2024 [<xref rid=""REF7"" ref-type=""bibr"">7</xref>]. We searched electronic databases such as MEDLINE, Scopus, Science Direct, and PubMed methodically. A comprehensive search method was developed to find papers on the connection between SCA and cognitive dysfunction. It combined Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) phrases with pertinent keywords. Examples of terms that could appear in the search are “Sickle cell anemia” OR “Sickle cell disease” alongside “Cognitive dysfunction” OR “cognition” OR “Neurocognitive dysfunction.” In order to capture a wider range of possible investigations, we also thought about incorporating sources from the grey literature, such as theses and conference proceedings. Eligibility Criteria Inclusion criteria: The studies eligible for inclusion must focus on the association between SCA and cognitive dysfunction. They should be published in English and involve human participants across all age groups, including both adults and pediatric populations. Additionally, the studies need to report specific cognitive outcomes or measures related to SCA and employ either observational or intervention study designs. These studies must provide clear and relevant data regarding the impact of SCA on cognitive function. Furthermore, the full-text articles of the studies must be accessible for review, and the research should have been conducted within the timeframe of 2019 to 2024. Exclusion criteria: Conversely, studies were excluded if they do not directly explore the relationship between SCA and cognitive dysfunction or if they were not published in English. Research based on animal models or in vitro studies was not considered, nor were studies that lacked specific cognitive outcomes related to SCA. Also excluded are case reports, case series, reviews, commentaries, or editorials. Studies that focus on diseases or conditions unrelated to SCA and those that present insufficient or incomplete data on cognitive function in individuals with SCA were also discarded. Data Extraction It was necessary to verify the accuracy of the search results using Rayyan (QCRI) (Shaurya Polymers Private Limited, India) [<xref rid=""REF8"" ref-type=""bibr"">8</xref>]. The titles and abstracts that were discovered during the search were evaluated for relevancy using the inclusion and exclusion criteria. Every article that met the inclusion requirements was thoroughly examined by the research team. Any issues were resolved by consensus. Important study information, including titles, authors, the release year, study setting, age, gender distribution, population type, tool used for cognitive dysfunction assessment, prevalence of cognitive dysfunction if mentioned, and main outcomes, were recorded using a predetermined data extraction form. A third-party assessment approach was developed to analyze the potential for bias. Data Synthesis Strategy A narrative synthesis approach was employed to amalgamate the results obtained from the research that was included. This involves grouping studies by research question and summarizing the key findings for each group. We also explored potential sources of variation across studies, such as differences in participant characteristics and cognition measurement methods. Risk of Bias Assessment The Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) critical evaluation criteria for studies providing prevalence data were used to evaluate the study's quality [<xref rid=""REF9"" ref-type=""bibr"">9</xref>]. This test consisted of nine questions. A good response received a score of 1, and a negative, unclear, or irrelevant response received a score of 0. Low, moderate, and high quality were assigned to scores that fall between 4 and 7, and 8 and above, accordingly. Disagreements were settled through conversation after researchers evaluated the studies' quality independently. Results Search Results A thorough search turned up a total of 2,216 study papers after 1,299 duplicates were eliminated. Eight hundred two papers were deleted after the titles and abstracts of 917 studies were assessed. Of the 115 reports that needed to be retrieved, seven could not be found. After 108 papers were screened for full-text evaluation, 62 were rejected due to incorrect study results, 22 due to incorrect population type, two articles had editor's letters, and four contained abstracts. This systematic review's 18 research publications met the qualifying criterion. A summary of the process by which the research was selected is shown in Figure <xref rid=""FIG1"" ref-type=""fig"">1</xref>. Sociodemographic Parameters of the Researched Subjects Table <xref rid=""TAB1"" ref-type=""table"">1</xref> displays the sociodemographic information from the research articles. Our data includes eighteen trials with 2,457 individuals, 1,151 (46.8%) of whom were males [<xref rid=""REF10"" ref-type=""bibr"">10</xref>-<xref rid=""REF27"" ref-type=""bibr"">27</xref>]. Nine studies were cross-sectional studies [<xref rid=""REF10"" ref-type=""bibr"">10</xref>,<xref rid=""REF13"" ref-type=""bibr"">13</xref>,<xref rid=""REF17"" ref-type=""bibr"">17</xref>,<xref rid=""REF18"" ref-type=""bibr"">18</xref>,<xref rid=""REF19"" ref-type=""bibr"">19</xref>,<xref rid=""REF22"" ref-type=""bibr"">22</xref>,<xref rid=""REF23"" ref-type=""bibr"">23</xref>,<xref rid=""REF25"" ref-type=""bibr"">25</xref>,<xref rid=""REF26"" ref-type=""bibr"">26</xref>], four were retrospective cohorts [<xref rid=""REF14"" ref-type=""bibr"">14</xref>,<xref rid=""REF16"" ref-type=""bibr"">16</xref>,<xref rid=""REF20"" ref-type=""bibr"">20</xref>,<xref rid=""REF21"" ref-type=""bibr"">21</xref>], three were case controls [<xref rid=""REF11"" ref-type=""bibr"">11</xref>,<xref rid=""REF12"" ref-type=""bibr"">12</xref>,<xref rid=""REF27"" ref-type=""bibr"">27</xref>], and two were prospective cohorts [<xref rid=""REF15"" ref-type=""bibr"">15</xref>,<xref rid=""REF24"" ref-type=""bibr"">24</xref>]. Three studies were conducted in the USA [<xref rid=""REF12"" ref-type=""bibr"">12</xref>,<xref rid=""REF18"" ref-type=""bibr"">18</xref>,<xref rid=""REF21"" ref-type=""bibr"">21</xref>], two in Brazil [<xref rid=""REF10"" ref-type=""bibr"">10</xref>,<xref rid=""REF27"" ref-type=""bibr"">27</xref>], two in Canada [<xref rid=""REF13"" ref-type=""bibr"">13</xref>,<xref rid=""REF15"" ref-type=""bibr"">15</xref>], two in Uganda [<xref rid=""REF19"" ref-type=""bibr"">19</xref>,<xref rid=""REF22"" ref-type=""bibr"">22</xref>], two in the UK [<xref rid=""REF16"" ref-type=""bibr"">16</xref>,<xref rid=""REF24"" ref-type=""bibr"">24</xref>], two in Tanzania [<xref rid=""REF23"" ref-type=""bibr"">23</xref>,<xref rid=""REF25"" ref-type=""bibr"">25</xref>], one in France [<xref rid=""REF14"" ref-type=""bibr"">14</xref>], one in Turkey [<xref rid=""REF17"" ref-type=""bibr"">17</xref>], one in Saudi Arabia [<xref rid=""REF20"" ref-type=""bibr"">20</xref>], and one in Egypt [<xref rid=""REF26"" ref-type=""bibr"">26</xref>]. Clinical Findings The clinical features are shown in Table <xref rid=""TAB2"" ref-type=""table"">2</xref>. Eight investigations on adults with SCA [<xref rid=""REF10"" ref-type=""bibr"">10</xref>-<xref rid=""REF17"" ref-type=""bibr"">17</xref>] found that the prevalence of cognitive impairment varied from 11.5% [<xref rid=""REF13"" ref-type=""bibr"">13</xref>] to 70% [<xref rid=""REF10"" ref-type=""bibr"">10</xref>]. Cognitive dysfunction among adults was significantly associated with poorer educational status [<xref rid=""REF10"" ref-type=""bibr"">10</xref>,<xref rid=""REF11"" ref-type=""bibr"">11</xref>], reduced family income [<xref rid=""REF10"" ref-type=""bibr"">10</xref>], decreasing kidney function [<xref rid=""REF13"" ref-type=""bibr"">13</xref>], older age [<xref rid=""REF13"" ref-type=""bibr"">13</xref>], stroke history [<xref rid=""REF14"" ref-type=""bibr"">14</xref>,<xref rid=""REF15"" ref-type=""bibr"">15</xref>,<xref rid=""REF17"" ref-type=""bibr"">17</xref>], and vasculopathy [<xref rid=""REF16"" ref-type=""bibr"">16</xref>].  Ten studies included the pediatric population with SCA [<xref rid=""REF18"" ref-type=""bibr"">18</xref>-<xref rid=""REF27"" ref-type=""bibr"">27</xref>] and the prevalence of cognitive dysfunction in children ranged from 10.2% [<xref rid=""REF22"" ref-type=""bibr"">22</xref>] to 68.2% [<xref rid=""REF23"" ref-type=""bibr"">23</xref>]. The decline in cognitive function among adults was significantly associated with children over the age of four [<xref rid=""REF19"" ref-type=""bibr"">19</xref>], abnormal transcranial Doppler and previous stroke [<xref rid=""REF21"" ref-type=""bibr"">21</xref>,<xref rid=""REF22"" ref-type=""bibr"">22</xref>], school absence [<xref rid=""REF23"" ref-type=""bibr"">23</xref>], age beyond 13 [<xref rid=""REF23"" ref-type=""bibr"">23</xref>], and increased BMI [<xref rid=""REF23"" ref-type=""bibr"">23</xref>]. Using graph analysis and diffusion MRI in individuals with SCA, a study found abnormalities in structural connectivity that mediate the relationship between measurements of blood oxygenation and cognitive functioning. Many children with SCA suffer neurological effects, emphasizing the significance of early detection and treatment [<xref rid=""REF20"" ref-type=""bibr"">20</xref>]. Graph analysis of diffusion MRI in individuals with SCA revealed abnormalities in structural connectivity that mediate the relationship between measurements of blood oxygenation and cognitive functioning [<xref rid=""REF18"" ref-type=""bibr"">18</xref>,<xref rid=""REF26"" ref-type=""bibr"">26</xref>]. Discussion One of the most common negative effects of SCA is deficits in cognitive performance. This is the first systematic review to comprehensively investigate the relationship between SCA and the incidence of cognitive dysfunction in both adult and pediatric populations. However, we found a lack of epidemiological data on the prevalence of cognitive dysfunction in SCA patients. In this review, eight studies included the adult population with SCA [<xref rid=""REF10"" ref-type=""bibr"">10</xref>-<xref rid=""REF17"" ref-type=""bibr"">17</xref>] and the prevalence of cognitive dysfunction in the adult population ranged from 11.5% [<xref rid=""REF13"" ref-type=""bibr"">13</xref>] to 70% [<xref rid=""REF10"" ref-type=""bibr"">10</xref>]. Cognitive dysfunction among adults was significantly associated with poorer educational status [<xref rid=""REF10"" ref-type=""bibr"">10</xref>,<xref rid=""REF11"" ref-type=""bibr"">11</xref>], reduced family income [<xref rid=""REF10"" ref-type=""bibr"">10</xref>], decreasing kidney function [<xref rid=""REF13"" ref-type=""bibr"">13</xref>], older age [<xref rid=""REF13"" ref-type=""bibr"">13</xref>], stroke history [<xref rid=""REF14"" ref-type=""bibr"">14</xref>,<xref rid=""REF15"" ref-type=""bibr"">15</xref>,<xref rid=""REF17"" ref-type=""bibr"">17</xref>], and vasculopathy [<xref rid=""REF16"" ref-type=""bibr"">16</xref>]. One of the most severe side effects of SCA is stroke, which affects up to 24% of patients by the age of 45 [<xref rid=""REF28"" ref-type=""bibr"">28</xref>]. By the age of 18, silent cerebral infarctions (SCI) affect 39% of patients, and in adults, they affect 53% of patients [<xref rid=""REF29"" ref-type=""bibr"">29</xref>-<xref rid=""REF31"" ref-type=""bibr"">31</xref>]. According to estimates, 33% of adults have cognitive impairment [<xref rid=""REF32"" ref-type=""bibr"">32</xref>]. These cognitive deficiencies affect social functioning and enjoyment of life, and they frequently result in unemployment [<xref rid=""REF33"" ref-type=""bibr"">33</xref>]. This variant was previously assumed to be innocuous due to its clinical pattern. A recent study found that the SCA is a distinct risk factor for the occurrence and prevalence of chronic renal illness and albuminuria [<xref rid=""REF34"" ref-type=""bibr"">34</xref>].  Furthermore, multiple studies have found that African Americans with SCA had a much-increased risk of cardiovascular abnormalities, including atrial fibrillation [<xref rid=""REF35"" ref-type=""bibr"">35</xref>]. Chronic renal illness [<xref rid=""REF36"" ref-type=""bibr"">36</xref>] and atrial fibrillation [<xref rid=""REF37"" ref-type=""bibr"">37</xref>] have been linked to a significantly higher incidence of dementia and cognitive impairment. A recent study discovered that young African Americans were considerably more likely than the healthy controls to have a silent brain infarction on an MRI. In the current review, ten studies included the pediatric population with SCA [<xref rid=""REF18"" ref-type=""bibr"">18</xref>-<xref rid=""REF27"" ref-type=""bibr"">27</xref>] and the prevalence of cognitive dysfunction in children ranged from 10.2% [<xref rid=""REF22"" ref-type=""bibr"">22</xref>] to 68.2% [<xref rid=""REF23"" ref-type=""bibr"">23</xref>]. The decline in cognitive function among adults was significantly associated with children over the age of four [<xref rid=""REF19"" ref-type=""bibr"">19</xref>], abnormal transcranial Doppler and previous stroke [<xref rid=""REF21"" ref-type=""bibr"">21</xref>,<xref rid=""REF22"" ref-type=""bibr"">22</xref>], school absence [<xref rid=""REF23"" ref-type=""bibr"">23</xref>], age beyond 13 [<xref rid=""REF23"" ref-type=""bibr"">23</xref>], and increased BMI [<xref rid=""REF23"" ref-type=""bibr"">23</xref>]. Prussien et al. reported that analyses revealed that compared to preschoolers, school-aged children had significantly more cognitive deficiencies [<xref rid=""REF38"" ref-type=""bibr"">38</xref>]. Fortunately, primary stroke prevention efforts combining transcranial Doppler screening in combination with either hydroxyurea medication, blood transfusion intervention, or both in high-risk children are lowering stroke incidence rates in children with SCA residing in higher-income countries [<xref rid=""REF39"" ref-type=""bibr"">39</xref>]. Unfortunately, no primary preventative treatment is available for children with SCI, which afflict up to 39% of school-aged children [<xref rid=""REF40"" ref-type=""bibr"">40</xref>]. More research is needed to determine the impact of medical medications used to reduce the risk of infarctions and anemia on cognition. In this review, a study found abnormalities in connectivity between structures that mediate relationships between blood oxygenation and cognitive functioning in patients with SCA utilizing graphing and diffusion MRI [<xref rid=""REF24"" ref-type=""bibr"">24</xref>]. Numerous studies have found that independent of hemolysis rate, children with SCA have poorer autoregulation of cerebral blood flow than healthy children [<xref rid=""REF41"" ref-type=""bibr"">41</xref>]. For this reason, it is believed that prolonged brain hypoxia causes the reduced cognitive function seen in SCA patients [<xref rid=""REF42"" ref-type=""bibr"">42</xref>]. The study highlights the need for future research to encompass more diverse populations, allowing for a deeper understanding of how socio-economic, geographic, and genetic factors influence cognitive outcomes in individuals with SC). Longitudinal studies are particularly suggested, as they can provide insights into how cognitive function evolves over time, taking into account aging, disease progression, and the effectiveness of treatment interventions. Additionally, fostering a multidisciplinary approach by involving healthcare providers from various specialties, such as neurology, hematology, psychology, and social work, can create a holistic care model that addresses both physical and cognitive health aspects. Standardization of cognitive assessment tools is essential for ensuring consistency across studies. Researchers are encouraged to focus on early interventions and preventative strategies tailored for children and adolescents with SCA, which could mitigate cognitive decline. It is also crucial to explore the underlying pathophysiological mechanisms that connect SCA and cognitive dysfunction through brain imaging studies and neuropsychological assessments. Furthermore, examining how different treatments-like hydroxyurea and blood transfusions-affect cognitive functions can provide valuable insights. The implications of this research extend beyond the clinical realm; findings may inform health policies geared toward improving care quality for individuals with SCA, ensuring that cognitive health resources and support services are accessible. The discovery of a significant association between SCA and cognitive dysfunction could inspire the creation of targeted cognitive interventions aimed at enhancing the quality of life of affected individuals. In addition, integrating mental health services into the overall care plan may become necessary, recognizing the potential for cognitive challenges to accompany anxiety and depression. Educational institutions might also benefit from this research by establishing support systems for students with SCA, thereby promoting inclusivity and academic success. Furthermore, the study may prompt increased funding and prioritization for cognitive dysfunction research in the SCA population, focusing on both prevention and treatment strategies. There may also be a need for enhanced training for healthcare providers regarding the cognitive implications associated with SCA, ensuring better patient management. Finally, raising public awareness about SCA and its cognitive implications can foster a greater understanding within the community, ultimately supporting individuals and families affected by this condition. The review's conclusions unequivocally demonstrate that cognitive function deficiencies are a defining characteristic of SCA, impacting individuals across all age groups. This pervasive cognitive impairment not only complicates the clinical picture of SCA but also profoundly affects the quality of life and functional independence of those diagnosed with the condition. The findings underscore a crucial implication: without effective strategies to slow or ideally halt cognitive decline, any medical interventions aimed at addressing various associated symptoms and complications of SCA are likely to be rendered ineffective. This highlights an urgent need for a multifaceted approach to treatment that prioritizes cognitive health alongside other medical concerns. Moreover, the implications of these findings extend beyond immediate clinical concerns. They call into question the current standards of care and suggest the need for a reevaluation of therapeutic protocols that may not adequately address the cognitive dimensions of SCA. Upcoming research should not only seek to delineate the mechanisms underlying cognitive deficits in SCA but also explore how these deficiencies interact with other clinical features of the disease.",N/A,10 9 2024

Prevention of disease, disability and suffering should be a primary goal of each society that hopes to provide a decent quality of life for its people. Prevention on the community- or population-based level is the most cost-effective approach and has the greatest impact on a community or population, whether it is a school, neighborhood, or nation. Many different approaches to preventing dental diseases exist and the most cost-effective method is health education. The quality of life for patients with SCA is critical in determining the process of health and disease. There was a difference in the OHrQoL among the SCA and control groups, similar to that of Ralstrom et al.<xref rid=""bib0029"" ref-type=""bibr""><sup>29</sup></xref> This study only included participants who were not suffering from a painful crisis at the time of the survey, medical conditions other than SCA and emergency dental appointments in the past six months. These facts may have led to evaluating only participants in good health, masking the OHrQoL during the acute pain that is a characteristic of SCA. The concept of quality of life related to oral health requires consideration not only of factors, such as malaise, pain, or functional changes, but should also include emotional aspects and social functions associated with oral health. Oral health is a significant component in the general quality of life of people, with important implications for their health status.

In addition, it is important to mention that the present results are of insufficient conclusiveness because only one oral index for clinical evaluation (DMFT) was used, as well as the fact that the analyses of some different domains related to quality of life were not included, but will be necessary for future studies. Prospective studies with larger samples may provide a better understanding of the relationship between SCA and dental tissues and the oral health-related quality of life. Considering the findings of our study, dental caries are associated with sickle cell anemia and they negatively impact the quality of life. To prevent the occurrence of dental caries and tooth loss and to avoid complications in the general health of patients with SCA, the inclusion of dental visits and dental care in the management strategy of patients with SCA should be considered. The negative impacts that poor oral health of the population have on their QoL make this issue a relevant problem for public health. Consequently, dentists have an important role in preventing health complications in patients with SCA.

Beyond Ischemia: The Rare Occurrence of Hemorrhagic Strokes in Pediatric Sickle Cell Anemia,"Sickle cell anemia (SCA) is a genetic disorder characterized by the production of abnormal hemoglobin S, leading to red blood cell sickling and subsequent vaso-occlusive events. Neurological complications, particularly strokes, significantly contribute to the morbidity and mortality associated with SCA. While ischemic strokes are more common, hemorrhagic strokes, though less frequent, present significant challenges, especially in the pediatric population. Understanding the complex interplay of genetic, environmental, and hematological factors is crucial for managing these cases. We report two cases of pediatric patients with SCA who experienced rare hemorrhagic strokes. The first case involves a nine-year-old male presenting with a subarachnoid hemorrhage, revealing cortical ischemia and multiple cerebral artery strictures. Early supportive measures resulted in a good clinical improvement, after which the patient underwent bone marrow transplantation. The second case describes a seven-year-old male who developed an epidural hematoma during a vaso-occlusive crisis, necessitating emergency surgical intervention. After initial persistent neurological deficits, the patient began to show gradual improvement with ongoing management, reflecting the complexity and severity of such events. Hemorrhagic strokes in pediatric SCA patients, though rare, represent significant clinical challenges due to their multifactorial etiology and complex management needs. These cases underscore the importance of a multidisciplinary approach and advanced diagnostic tools in managing hemorrhagic complications in SCA. Further research is essential to unravel the pathophysiological mechanisms and develop targeted prevention strategies to improve outcomes for this vulnerable population.","Sickle cell anemia (SCA) is a genetic hemoglobinopathy resulting from a mutation in the β-globin gene, leading to the production of abnormal hemoglobin S (HbS). This mutation causes red blood cells to assume a rigid, sickle-like shape, particularly under conditions of low oxygen tension. Cerebrovascular complications are a prominent concern in SCA, often resulting from both vasoconstriction and vaso-occlusion within cerebral vessels. Sickled red blood cells obstruct blood flow, leading to ischemic injury, while chronic inflammation and endothelial dysfunction further exacerbate vascular damage. Additionally, hemorrhagic events may occur due to weakened blood vessels, increasing the risk of strokes and other neurological deficits. These factors contribute significantly to the neurological morbidity associated with the disease [<xref rid=""REF1"" ref-type=""bibr"">1</xref>,<xref rid=""REF2"" ref-type=""bibr"">2</xref>]. Stroke is a devastating complication, occurring in approximately 11% of children with SCA by the age of 20 ​[<xref rid=""REF1"" ref-type=""bibr"">1</xref>,<xref rid=""REF2"" ref-type=""bibr"">2</xref>]. Strokes in SCA can be classified into ischemic and hemorrhagic types, with ischemic strokes being more prevalent in children, while hemorrhagic strokes are more common in adults. The incidence of hemorrhagic stroke in the pediatric SCA population is relatively low, estimated at around 3%, but the implications are serious, often resulting in long-term neurological deficits ​[<xref rid=""REF2"" ref-type=""bibr"">2</xref>]. Hemorrhagic strokes in SCA patients can manifest as intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH), subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH), epidural hematoma (EDH), and subdural hematoma (SDH). Each of these subtypes presents unique challenges in terms of pathophysiology, diagnosis, and management​ [<xref rid=""REF2"" ref-type=""bibr"">2</xref>,<xref rid=""REF3"" ref-type=""bibr"">3</xref>]. The risk factors for hemorrhagic stroke in this population include hypertension, previous ischemic stroke, moyamoya syndrome, cerebral aneurysms, and recent blood transfusion ​[<xref rid=""REF1"" ref-type=""bibr"">1</xref>,<xref rid=""REF3"" ref-type=""bibr"">3</xref>]. Despite advances in medical management and the introduction of screening protocols such as transcranial Doppler (TCD) ultrasound to detect cerebral vasculopathy, the prevention and treatment of hemorrhagic strokes in pediatric SCA patients remain complex​ [<xref rid=""REF4"" ref-type=""bibr"">4</xref>]​. Recent studies highlight the role of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) in identifying vascular abnormalities that predispose to hemorrhagic events​ [<xref rid=""REF1"" ref-type=""bibr"">1</xref>,<xref rid=""REF3"" ref-type=""bibr"">3</xref>]. In this report, we present two cases of pediatric patients with SCA who experienced hemorrhagic strokes, specifically a subarachnoid hemorrhage and an epidural hemorrhage. These cases underscore the need for heightened vigilance and a comprehensive approach to managing and preventing hemorrhagic complications in this vulnerable population. Case 1 A nine-year-old male with a known history of SCA was initially admitted due to a vaso-occlusive crisis (VOC). During his admission, he developed severe headaches, vomiting, and seizures. Additionally, he developed hypertension and was managed with hydralazine and amlodipine. He was also started on phenytoin and levetiracetam for seizure control. The patient had a history of acute chest syndrome (ACS), for which he had previously undergone exchange transfusion, as well as multiple prior admissions for VOC. The patient was not compliant with hydroxyurea therapy. His developmental milestones were age-appropriate, his vaccinations were up to date and there was no history of previous surgeries. Upon presentation, a computed tomography (CT) scan performed revealed evidence of SAH located at the upper right Sylvian fissure, the right high parietal sulci, the anterior interhemispheric fissure, and, to a lesser extent, the left frontal sulci and anterior left Sylvian fissure. The imaging also showed cortical edema and decreased density in the right high posterior parietal region, with effacement of the adjacent sulci suggestive of cortical ischemia. No midline shift, hydrocephalus, or space-occupying lesions (SOL) were identified. The adenoids were hypertrophied (Figure <xref rid=""FIG1"" ref-type=""fig"">1</xref>). Subsequent MRI and MRA scans of the brain (Figure <xref rid=""FIG2"" ref-type=""fig"">2</xref>) demonstrated cortical and subcortical edema with abnormal high T2 and FLAIR (fluid-attenuated inversion recovery) signal intensity and mild restricted diffusion in the right posterior parietal region, consistent with acute minor cortical ischemia. There was SAH with dark gradient signal intensity in the right high posterior parietal region, left frontal region, and right temporoparietal sulci, extending to the interhemispheric fissure. Multiple strictures were noted in the intercavernous and supraclinoid segments of the internal carotid arteries (ICA) bilaterally, with severe and diffuse narrowing of the right supraclinoid ICA and its branches (A1 & A2 of ACA {anterior cerebral artery} and M1 of MCA {middle cerebral artery}), which were less apparent on CT angiography. The left supraclinoid ICA showed diffuse narrowing, though to a lesser degree than the right, and was similarly less pronounced on CT angiography. Additionally, the straight sinus was not visualized on magnetic resonance venography (MRV) but was noted in previous CTs with contrast. The anterior superior sagittal sinus (SSS) displayed areas not well recognized on MRV, appearing as diffuse narrowing. The posterior SSS showed similar characteristics, again more apparent on previous CTs. Diffuse narrowing of the lateral sinuses without filling defects was present, and there was notable collateralization with prominent superficial veins. No frank cerebral aneurysm or arteriovenous malformation (AVM) was identified. The patient was admitted to the pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) for further management. His hemoglobin levels dropped during the hospital stay (Table <xref rid=""TAB1"" ref-type=""table"">1</xref>), prompting a blood transfusion. Supportive care was provided, including hydration, pain management, antihypertensive and antiepileptic medications. Neurosurgical consultation was requested; however, surgical intervention was deemed unnecessary. Over the course of his admission, the patient showed gradual clinical improvement, and he was discharged in stable condition with no neurological deficits. A comprehensive neurological examination and systemic evaluation during admission revealed no remarkable findings. Given the evidence of cerebral ischemia observed on imaging, the patient was initiated on a regular transfusion program. Following successful bone marrow transplantation (BMT), the patient is now cured of SCA and currently maintains a good state of health. Case 2 The second case involves a seven-year-old male with a known history of SCA. He has a significant history of frequent hemolytic crises and was previously under the care of another hospital before presenting to us. The child was admitted to our hospital due to a severe VOC, characterized by intense pain localized to the lower limbs and lumbar region, as well as abdominal pain and distension. Despite being on a regular treatment regimen of hydroxyurea and folic acid, his condition had acutely worsened. On admission, the child was in distress. He exhibited stable vital signs and was afebrile, but he was notably jaundiced, with no respiratory or central nervous system symptoms initially. His pain was severe and inadequately controlled despite initial management with non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, paracetamol, and opioids (morphine). Laboratory tests revealed leukocytosis, anemia with a hemoglobin level of 5.5 gm/dl, an elevated reticulocyte count, and a slightly low platelet count (Table <xref rid=""TAB1"" ref-type=""table"">1</xref>). On the following day, the patient's condition showed no significant improvement. He continued to suffer from severe pain and exhibited abdominal distension. The lack of immediate response to analgesics and supportive therapy prompted further investigation. His hemoglobin dropped further, and a blood transfusion was initiated. Later, the patient developed a fever of 38.5°C, which was managed with antibiotics and antipyretics. After resuming and completing the blood transfusion, the patient initially showed slight improvement and normal vital signs. However, he subsequently experienced a sudden decline in neurological status, manifesting as decreased consciousness and lethargy. A brain CT scan was urgently performed, revealing an epidural hematoma with significant midline shift, suggestive of acute intracranial hemorrhage (Figure <xref rid=""FIG3"" ref-type=""fig"">3</xref>). This alarming finding necessitated immediate intervention. The child was intubated to secure his airway, and a multidisciplinary team involving hematology, neurosurgery, and critical care specialists was engaged for further management. In response to the clinical and imaging findings, the patient underwent emergency surgical intervention for evacuation of the hematoma. Despite the surgical intervention, the child remained intubated and in critical condition in the PICU. His postoperative course was complicated by persistent neurological deficits, necessitating ongoing intensive monitoring and supportive care. An MRI of the brain was conducted, showing multiple parenchymal areas of abnormal signal in the right occipital lobe, right frontal lobe, and several subcortical regions. The MRI findings were consistent with acute cerebral insult, likely secondary to vaso-occlusive phenomena associated with sickle cell disease (Figure <xref rid=""FIG4"" ref-type=""fig"">4</xref>). The MRI report further elucidated the severity of the condition, indicating no significant major cerebral arterial occlusion but suggesting acute soft head syndrome, a known complication in sickle cell disease. This condition contributes to neurological deterioration through vascular occlusion and ischemia, complicating an already severe clinical picture. Throughout his PICU stay, laboratory studies continued to indicate a pattern consistent with disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), complicating his clinical picture with additional bleeding risks. His management required careful balancing of transfusion needs, and infection control measures, including broad-spectrum antibiotics to prevent sepsis. During the PICU admission, with intensive supportive care, the child was extubated and began to show gradual improvement. A chronic transfusion program was planned due to the evidence of ischemia on MRI imaging. This case illustrates the complex interplay of sickle cell disease and its severe complications, including VOC leading to life-threatening neurological events and systemic hematological disturbances. SCA is a hereditary hemoglobinopathy characterized by the presence of sickle-shaped red blood cells. These cells are prone to causing vascular occlusions and subsequent ischemic damage due to their altered shape and function [<xref rid=""REF5"" ref-type=""bibr"">5</xref>]. While ischemic strokes are more common in individuals with SCA, hemorrhagic strokes, though less frequent, represent a significant cause of morbidity and mortality, especially in the pediatric population [<xref rid=""REF6"" ref-type=""bibr"">6</xref>]. Hemorrhagic strokes can manifest as SAH, ICH, or EDH, each presenting unique challenges in terms of diagnosis, management, and prevention [<xref rid=""REF7"" ref-type=""bibr"">7</xref>]. The etiology of hemorrhagic stroke in patients with SCA is complex and multifaceted, involving a combination of genetic, hematological, and environmental factors. Each of these factors contributes uniquely to the risk profile of an individual with SCA, making the management and prevention of hemorrhagic strokes particularly challenging. Hemorrhagic strokes in SCA are often distinguished by characteristic findings such as chronic anemia, elevated white blood cell counts, and specific radiological patterns like cerebral vessel abnormalities or infarction, which help confirm the association with SCA rather than other causes. Genetic predisposition plays a crucial role in determining the risk of hemorrhagic stroke in SCA patients. Several studies have identified specific genetic markers associated with an increased susceptibility to hemorrhagic events. For instance, the APOE-ε4 allele, which is more prevalent in individuals of African descent, has been linked to a higher risk of ICH among those with SCA [<xref rid=""REF1"" ref-type=""bibr"">1</xref>,<xref rid=""REF8"" ref-type=""bibr"">8</xref>,<xref rid=""REF9"" ref-type=""bibr"">9</xref>]. This allele, known for its role in lipid metabolism, may contribute to cerebrovascular vulnerability in the context of sickle cell disease (SCD). Additionally, polymorphisms in genes such as ACE (angiotensin-converting enzyme), COL4A2 (type IV collagen alpha 2 chain), and MTHFR (methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase) have also been implicated in increasing the risk of hemorrhagic stroke [<xref rid=""REF10"" ref-type=""bibr"">10</xref>]. The ACE gene, for example, is involved in blood pressure regulation, and certain variants may predispose individuals to hypertension, a known risk factor for stroke [<xref rid=""REF1"" ref-type=""bibr"">1</xref>,<xref rid=""REF2"" ref-type=""bibr"">2</xref>]. Environmental and physiological factors significantly contribute to the risk of hemorrhagic stroke in SCA patients. Hypertension, although traditionally not considered a major issue in SCD, has emerged as a significant concern and a potential risk factor for hemorrhagic stroke [<xref rid=""REF1"" ref-type=""bibr"">1</xref>,<xref rid=""REF9"" ref-type=""bibr"">9</xref>]. Chronic hemolytic anemia, a hallmark of SCA, leads to hyperdynamic circulation and increased cardiac output, which can predispose individuals to hypertension [<xref rid=""REF1"" ref-type=""bibr"">1</xref>,<xref rid=""REF2"" ref-type=""bibr"">2</xref>,<xref rid=""REF9"" ref-type=""bibr"">9</xref>]. Over time, this increased vascular pressure can weaken blood vessel walls, making them more susceptible to rupture during hypertensive episodes. Additionally, lifestyle factors, including diet and physical activity, may also influence blood pressure levels and, consequently, stroke risk. Hematological factors, including low steady-state hemoglobin concentration, high steady-state leukocyte count, and thrombocytopenia, further exacerbate the risk of bleeding in SCA patients. The chronic and recurrent VOC associated with SCA leads to endothelial damage and increased vessel fragility, setting the stage for potential hemorrhagic events [<xref rid=""REF7"" ref-type=""bibr"">7</xref>]. The repeated sickling and unsickling of red blood cells contribute to microvascular damage, which can compromise the integrity of blood vessel walls. Furthermore, the increased use of hydroxyurea in SCA management, while beneficial in reducing the frequency of vaso-occlusive episodes, may have complex effects on platelet counts and function [<xref rid=""REF8"" ref-type=""bibr"">8</xref>]. Hydroxyurea works by inducing fetal hemoglobin production, which reduces sickling; however, it can also affect bone marrow function and potentially alter the hemostatic balance, thereby influencing bleeding risk. In our first case, the patient’s leukocytic count was not primarily elevated, however, he exhibited persistently low steady-state hemoglobin levels due to frequent hemolysis. In contrast, the second patient, despite not experiencing frequent crises, maintained hemoglobin levels ranging between 7.5 and 8.5 g/dL, with a steady-state leukocytic count within normal limits. Neither patient had a prior history of hypertension or other known risk factors for stroke, although the first patient developed hypertension during his admission. Additionally, the first patient was non-compliant with hydroxyurea treatment, whereas the second patient demonstrated adherence to the prescribed regimen. Notably, the interplay of genetic, environmental, and hematological factors in SCA creates a complex landscape of risk for hemorrhagic stroke. Understanding these factors is essential for developing targeted interventions and preventive strategies aimed at reducing the burden of stroke in this vulnerable population. Ongoing research into the genetic underpinnings and pathophysiological mechanisms of stroke in SCA will be crucial in guiding future therapeutic approaches and improving outcomes for patients. The pathophysiology of hemorrhagic stroke in SCA involves several interrelated mechanisms that collectively increase the risk of cerebrovascular events. Chronic hemolysis, a hallmark of SCA, results in the release of free hemoglobin into the bloodstream. This free hemoglobin binds to and scavenges nitric oxide (NO), a molecule essential for maintaining vascular tone and endothelial function [<xref rid=""REF11"" ref-type=""bibr"">11</xref>]. The reduction in NO availability leads to endothelial dysfunction and increased vascular permeability, making blood vessels more susceptible to damage and rupture [<xref rid=""REF12"" ref-type=""bibr"">12</xref>]. This process is a key contributor to the formation of aneurysms and other vascular malformations, such as moyamoya disease, which are frequently observed in SCA patients and serve as significant risk factors for hemorrhagic stroke [<xref rid=""REF13"" ref-type=""bibr"">13</xref>,<xref rid=""REF14"" ref-type=""bibr"">14</xref>]. In addition to the effects of hemolysis, the sickled red blood cells themselves play a direct role in promoting vascular injury. These abnormally shaped cells are rigid and prone to causing blockages in small blood vessels, leading to chronic vascular inflammation and oxidative stress [<xref rid=""REF15"" ref-type=""bibr"">15</xref>]. The repeated episodes of vaso-occlusion and reperfusion injury associated with SCA exacerbate endothelial damage over time. This ongoing endothelial injury results in a cycle of inflammation and repair, which further weakens the vascular walls and increases the likelihood of hemorrhage [<xref rid=""REF7"" ref-type=""bibr"">7</xref>,<xref rid=""REF11"" ref-type=""bibr"">11</xref>]. The continuous oxidative stress generated by the presence of sickled cells contributes to the degradation of the vascular endothelium, compounding the risk of hemorrhagic events [<xref rid=""REF14"" ref-type=""bibr"">14</xref>,<xref rid=""REF15"" ref-type=""bibr"">15</xref>]. The presence of moyamoya arteriopathy, characterized by progressive stenosis of the intracranial vessels and the subsequent development of fragile collateral networks, adds another layer of complexity to the pathophysiology of hemorrhagic stroke in SCA [<xref rid=""REF12"" ref-type=""bibr"">12</xref>,<xref rid=""REF13"" ref-type=""bibr"">13</xref>]. Moyamoya disease is a condition where the cerebral blood vessels become increasingly narrowed, leading to the formation of a network of tiny, fragile vessels that attempt to compensate for reduced blood flow. These collateral vessels are prone to rupture, especially under the stress of increased blood pressure or other hemodynamic changes, thereby significantly raising the risk of both ischemic and hemorrhagic strokes in affected individuals [<xref rid=""REF12"" ref-type=""bibr"">12</xref>,<xref rid=""REF14"" ref-type=""bibr"">14</xref>]. Furthermore, the chronic inflammatory state induced by sickled red blood cells and the associated oxidative stress not only damages the endothelium but also disrupts the blood-brain barrier [<xref rid=""REF11"" ref-type=""bibr"">11</xref>]. This disruption allows for the leakage of blood components into the brain parenchyma, exacerbating cerebral edema and increasing the potential for intracranial hemorrhage [<xref rid=""REF14"" ref-type=""bibr"">14</xref>,<xref rid=""REF15"" ref-type=""bibr"">15</xref>]. The repeated inflammatory insults and resultant vascular remodeling in SCA patients create a fragile cerebrovascular network that is highly susceptible to rupture under conditions of hemodynamic stress or hypertensive episodes [<xref rid=""REF12"" ref-type=""bibr"">12</xref>]. Moreover, the hemodynamic changes associated with chronic anemia in SCA, including increased cardiac output and hyperdynamic circulation, place additional stress on the cerebral vasculature [<xref rid=""REF11"" ref-type=""bibr"">11</xref>]. The compensatory mechanisms aimed at maintaining adequate tissue perfusion under anemic conditions lead to elevated blood flow velocities and shear stress on the vessel walls [<xref rid=""REF15"" ref-type=""bibr"">15</xref>]. Over time, these hemodynamic forces contribute to the weakening of the vascular structures and predispose patients to hemorrhagic strokes [<xref rid=""REF12"" ref-type=""bibr"">12</xref>,<xref rid=""REF14"" ref-type=""bibr"">14</xref>]. Hemorrhagic stroke in pediatric SCA patients presents with a variety of clinical symptoms that are influenced by the location and severity of the hemorrhage. These symptoms are often sudden and severe, which necessitates prompt recognition and intervention to prevent further complications. The clinical manifestations of hemorrhagic stroke in SCA are diverse and can sometimes overlap with other complications of the disease, complicating the diagnostic process. Understanding these manifestations in detail is crucial for timely and effective management. The most common initial symptom of a hemorrhagic stroke in pediatric SCA patients is a sudden, severe headache, often described by patients as the ""worst headache of their life."" This symptom is reported in approximately 60-80% of pediatric patients with intracranial hemorrhages [<xref rid=""REF14"" ref-type=""bibr"">14</xref>,<xref rid=""REF16"" ref-type=""bibr"">16</xref>]. The intensity of the headache may vary depending on the location of the hemorrhage. In cases of ICH, the headache is typically localized, while in SAH, it is often diffuse and associated with neck stiffness (nuchal rigidity) and photophobia due to meningeal irritation [<xref rid=""REF14"" ref-type=""bibr"">14</xref>,<xref rid=""REF16"" ref-type=""bibr"">16</xref>]. In our report, the first case presented with a severe headache, vomiting, seizures, and accompanied hypertension while the second case involved a sudden deterioration in consciousness with no preceding symptoms other than the pain associated with the vaso-occlusive crisis. Vomiting and altered levels of consciousness are also common presentations. Approximately 40-60% of patients experience nausea and vomiting, which can occur suddenly and without warning [<xref rid=""REF7"" ref-type=""bibr"">7</xref>]. Altered consciousness ranges from mild confusion to deep coma and is observed in 30-50% of pediatric cases with significant hemorrhagic events [<xref rid=""REF14"" ref-type=""bibr"">14</xref>,<xref rid=""REF16"" ref-type=""bibr"">16</xref>]. The severity of these symptoms often correlates with the extent and location of the bleed, with larger or more strategically placed hemorrhages (such as those affecting the brainstem) leading to more profound alterations in consciousness. Focal neurological deficits, such as hemiparesis, aphasia, or sensory disturbances, are present in about 50-70% of pediatric patients with hemorrhagic strokes [<xref rid=""REF16"" ref-type=""bibr"">16</xref>]. Hemiparesis is particularly common when the hemorrhage occurs in or near motor areas of the brain. These deficits can help localize the lesion but can also mimic symptoms of ischemic strokes or other complications like acute chest syndrome (ACS) or VOC [<xref rid=""REF7"" ref-type=""bibr"">7</xref>,<xref rid=""REF14"" ref-type=""bibr"">14</xref>]. This mimicry underscores the importance of differential diagnosis in the clinical setting. The overlap in clinical presentation with other SCA-related complications, such as VOC, ACS, and severe infections, poses a significant challenge in early and accurate diagnosis. VOC, for example, can also present with severe pain and neurological symptoms due to infarcts or bone marrow expansion, potentially leading clinicians to misattribute the symptoms if not carefully evaluated [<xref rid=""REF16"" ref-type=""bibr"">16</xref>,<xref rid=""REF17"" ref-type=""bibr"">17</xref>]. Neuroimaging is essential in distinguishing hemorrhagic stroke from these other conditions. MRI and CT scans are the primary tools used for diagnosis. MRI is particularly valuable due to its sensitivity in detecting subtle changes in brain tissue, including those caused by small hemorrhages and associated edema [<xref rid=""REF7"" ref-type=""bibr"">7</xref>,<xref rid=""REF18"" ref-type=""bibr"">18</xref>]. It can identify characteristic features such as the presence of hemosiderin deposits from previous bleeds or evidence of moyamoya disease, which is seen in approximately 6-8% of pediatric SCA patients [<xref rid=""REF16"" ref-type=""bibr"">16</xref>]. CT scans, while less sensitive than MRI in detecting certain types of hemorrhages, are more readily available and can rapidly identify acute bleeding, making them invaluable in emergency settings [<xref rid=""REF7"" ref-type=""bibr"">7</xref>]. In a study involving pediatric SCA patients, CT scans were used to confirm the diagnosis of hemorrhagic stroke in over 90% of acute cases, highlighting their crucial role in initial assessment [<xref rid=""REF17"" ref-type=""bibr"">17</xref>]. The MRI in our study of the second case revealed an additional finding of soft head syndrome with widespread abnormal signal intensity at the left parietal bone. While epidural hemorrhage is typically associated with traumatic events, which is not the case for our patient, the presence of soft head syndrome may serve as a precipitating factor. Soft head syndrome is characterized by the softening of the scalp due to vaso-occlusive crises and bone marrow expansion, which can lead to cortical disruption, osteonecrosis, and reactive subgaleal collections. This condition, combined with the vascular fragility inherent in sickle cell anemia, may increase the likelihood of spontaneous epidural hematoma formation, even without a clear history of trauma. The management of hemorrhagic stroke in patients with SCA necessitates a comprehensive, multidisciplinary approach tailored to the specific needs of each patient. This complex condition requires the coordinated efforts of various healthcare professionals, including hematologists, neurologists, neurosurgeons, intensivists, and rehabilitation specialists, to optimize outcomes and minimize complications [<xref rid=""REF19"" ref-type=""bibr"">19</xref>,<xref rid=""REF20"" ref-type=""bibr"">20</xref>]. Immediate management goals focus on stabilizing the patient, controlling intracranial pressure, preventing rebleeding, and addressing the underlying pathophysiological processes associated with SCA. Stabilization of the patient is the first and foremost priority in the acute setting. This involves ensuring airway patency, adequate breathing, and circulation. Intravenous access should be secured for the administration of medications and fluids, and continuous monitoring of vital signs is essential to detect any signs of deterioration [<xref rid=""REF7"" ref-type=""bibr"">7</xref>,<xref rid=""REF14"" ref-type=""bibr"">14</xref>]. In cases of severe hemorrhagic stroke, patients may require intubation and mechanical ventilation to protect the airway and support respiratory function [<xref rid=""REF21"" ref-type=""bibr"">21</xref>]. Controlling intracranial pressure (ICP) is a critical aspect of managing hemorrhagic stroke. Elevated ICP can lead to brain herniation and further neurological damage, so timely intervention is crucial [<xref rid=""REF7"" ref-type=""bibr"">7</xref>,<xref rid=""REF14"" ref-type=""bibr"">14</xref>]. Medical management typically includes the use of osmotic agents such as mannitol or hypertonic saline to reduce cerebral edema and lower ICP [<xref rid=""REF21"" ref-type=""bibr"">21</xref>,<xref rid=""REF22"" ref-type=""bibr"">22</xref>]. These agents work by drawing fluid out of the brain tissue, thereby reducing swelling and relieving pressure on the brain. In addition to osmotic therapy, maintaining the head of the bed at a 30-degree angle can also aid in reducing ICP by promoting venous drainage [<xref rid=""REF19"" ref-type=""bibr"">19</xref>]. In our first case, anticonvulsants were necessary to prevent and manage seizures, a common complication of hemorrhagic stroke caused by the irritation of the cerebral cortex by blood products [<xref rid=""REF22"" ref-type=""bibr"">22</xref>]. Antiepileptic drugs such as levetiracetam or phenytoin can be used to reduce the risk of seizures and prevent further neurological injury [<xref rid=""REF21"" ref-type=""bibr"">21</xref>]. Surgical intervention is often required in cases where there is a significant mass effect, midline shift, or continued bleeding despite medical management [<xref rid=""REF19"" ref-type=""bibr"">19</xref>]. Procedures such as craniotomy or hematoma evacuation can be lifesaving by alleviating pressure on the brain and removing the source of bleeding [<xref rid=""REF7"" ref-type=""bibr"">7</xref>]. The decision to proceed with surgery depends on the location and size of the hemorrhage, as well as the patient's overall clinical status [<xref rid=""REF21"" ref-type=""bibr"">21</xref>]. In some cases, endovascular techniques such as coiling, or embolization may be used to manage aneurysms or vascular malformations that are contributing to the hemorrhage [<xref rid=""REF7"" ref-type=""bibr"">7</xref>,<xref rid=""REF14"" ref-type=""bibr"">14</xref>]. In our study, the first case was managed conservatively using supportive measures, eliminating the need for surgical intervention. In contrast, the second case required surgical evacuation of the hematoma in addition to supportive care, which included respiratory support and inotropes. This underscores the importance of tailoring the treatment plan to each patient's unique clinical circumstances, highlighting the need for an individualized approach to management. In the context of SCA, blood transfusions play a pivotal role in managing hemorrhagic stroke. Transfusions help to reduce the proportion of sickle hemoglobin (HbS) in the circulation, thereby decreasing the risk of further sickling and improving oxygen delivery to tissues [<xref rid=""REF14"" ref-type=""bibr"">14</xref>,<xref rid=""REF21"" ref-type=""bibr"">21</xref>]. Exchange transfusions are particularly effective in rapidly lowering HbS levels and can be beneficial in severe cases. However, they must be used cautiously and tailored to individual patients, as they can cause additional harm if not appropriately indicated or performed correctly. Rapid changes in blood volume and viscosity during the procedure may affect intracranial pressure, potentially worsening neurological outcomes. Additionally, alterations in electrolytes and fluid balance can increase the risk of seizures in patients already vulnerable due to a hemorrhagic event [<xref rid=""REF7"" ref-type=""bibr"">7</xref>,<xref rid=""REF22"" ref-type=""bibr"">22</xref>]. Hydroxyurea, a medication traditionally used to prevent VOC and ischemic strokes, may also have a role in reducing the frequency of hemorrhagic episodes in SCA patients [<xref rid=""REF19"" ref-type=""bibr"">19</xref>,<xref rid=""REF21"" ref-type=""bibr"">21</xref>]. Hydroxyurea works by increasing fetal hemoglobin (HbF) production, which reduces the overall proportion of sickle hemoglobin and ameliorates the sickling process [<xref rid=""REF14"" ref-type=""bibr"">14</xref>]. Its potential benefits in hemorrhagic stroke management are still being explored, but it may contribute to improved vascular stability and reduced inflammation [<xref rid=""REF23"" ref-type=""bibr"">23</xref>]. Emerging therapies offer promising avenues for modifying the disease course and reducing the risk of both ischemic and hemorrhagic strokes in SCA. Gene therapy, which aims to correct the underlying genetic defect in sickle cell anemia, is currently under investigation and has shown potential in preclinical and early clinical trials [<xref rid=""REF19"" ref-type=""bibr"">19</xref>,<xref rid=""REF22"" ref-type=""bibr"">22</xref>]. By introducing healthy copies of the beta-globin gene or using genome editing techniques to reactivate fetal hemoglobin production, gene therapy has the potential to cure SCA and eliminate its complications [<xref rid=""REF20"" ref-type=""bibr"">20</xref>]. Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) is another potential curative approach for SCA that has demonstrated efficacy in reducing the risk of stroke and other complications [<xref rid=""REF7"" ref-type=""bibr"">7</xref>]. HSCT involves replacing the patient's diseased bone marrow with healthy donor stem cells capable of producing normal red blood cells [<xref rid=""REF24"" ref-type=""bibr"">24</xref>]. While HSCT has shown promise, it is associated with significant risks, including graft-versus-host disease and long-term immunosuppression, and is therefore typically reserved for severe cases or patients with matched sibling donors [<xref rid=""REF22"" ref-type=""bibr"">22</xref>,<xref rid=""REF24"" ref-type=""bibr"">24</xref>]. Ongoing research is focused on improving the safety and accessibility of HSCT, including the use of alternative donor sources and reduced-intensity conditioning regimens [<xref rid=""REF19"" ref-type=""bibr"">19</xref>]. However, these emerging treatments require further research to establish their efficacy and safety in the pediatric population. Clinical trials are ongoing, and it is hoped that these innovative therapies will eventually become standard care for managing SCA and preventing its complications [<xref rid=""REF7"" ref-type=""bibr"">7</xref>,<xref rid=""REF19"" ref-type=""bibr"">19</xref>]. Until these treatments become widely available, the management of hemorrhagic stroke in SCA will continue to rely on established medical and surgical interventions, tailored to the individual needs of each patient [<xref rid=""REF21"" ref-type=""bibr"">21</xref>,<xref rid=""REF22"" ref-type=""bibr"">22</xref>]. The prognosis of hemorrhagic stroke in pediatric sickle cell anemia (SCA) patients is variable and depends on several factors, including the severity of the hemorrhage, the presence of underlying vascular abnormalities, and the timeliness of intervention [<xref rid=""REF7"" ref-type=""bibr"">7</xref>,<xref rid=""REF16"" ref-type=""bibr"">16</xref>]. Studies have shown that while the overall survival rates have improved with advances in medical care, long-term neurological outcomes remain a concern [<xref rid=""REF24"" ref-type=""bibr"">24</xref>]. Complications such as cognitive impairment, motor deficits, and recurrent strokes are not uncommon and necessitate ongoing rehabilitation and support [<xref rid=""REF17"" ref-type=""bibr"">17</xref>,<xref rid=""REF20"" ref-type=""bibr"">20</xref>]. The severity of the hemorrhage plays a significant role, as severe hemorrhages leading to extensive brain damage are associated with a poorer prognosis compared to milder cases [<xref rid=""REF17"" ref-type=""bibr"">17</xref>,<xref rid=""REF25"" ref-type=""bibr"">25</xref>]. Additionally, the presence of vascular abnormalities, such as moyamoya syndrome or aneurysms, can complicate the course of the disease and worsen outcomes. Children with these conditions are at higher risk for recurrent strokes, requiring vigilant monitoring and treatment [<xref rid=""REF14"" ref-type=""bibr"">14</xref>,<xref rid=""REF16"" ref-type=""bibr"">16</xref>]. The timeliness of intervention is also crucial, as early intervention and management can significantly improve outcomes by mitigating damage and enhancing recovery prospects [<xref rid=""REF20"" ref-type=""bibr"">20</xref>,<xref rid=""REF21"" ref-type=""bibr"">21</xref>]. In terms of long-term outcomes, cognitive impairment is a common challenge faced by many children who experience hemorrhagic stroke, impacting their academic performance and overall quality of life [<xref rid=""REF23"" ref-type=""bibr"">23</xref>,<xref rid=""REF24"" ref-type=""bibr"">24</xref>]. Motor deficits, such as hemiparesis or other impairments, often require long-term rehabilitation to maximize recovery and function [<xref rid=""REF7"" ref-type=""bibr"">7</xref>]. Furthermore, there is a significant risk of recurrent strokes in this population, necessitating ongoing preventative strategies such as regular blood transfusions or hydroxyurea therapy to reduce the risk and improve patient outcomes [<xref rid=""REF14"" ref-type=""bibr"">14</xref>,<xref rid=""REF17"" ref-type=""bibr"">17</xref>]. Hemorrhagic strokes in pediatric patients with sickle cell anemia, although rare, represent complex and life-threatening events. These cases demonstrate the critical role of early recognition, intensive supportive care, and multidisciplinary management in improving outcomes. While bone marrow transplantation offers a curative option, regular transfusion programs remain essential in mitigating ischemic risks. Further research is crucial to better understand the underlying pathophysiology and to develop effective preventive strategies for managing these challenging complications in sickle cell disease.",N/A,5 10 2024
Knowledge and Attitudes of Blood Donors Toward Sickle Cell Anemia in Ibadan,"Background Sickle cell anemia (SCA) is a common condition of public health concern in Nigeria. Different therapeutic approaches have been developed to manage SCA, including blood transfusion. In a bid to develop a sustainable solution to the blood supply pool, the SmileBuilders Initiative organizes a blood donation drive (Donate-A-Pint Project) quarterly in Ibadan, Nigeria. This study aimed to assess the awareness, knowledge, and attitudes of blood donors in Ibadan, Nigeria, towards SCA. Methods A descriptive cross-sectional study was conducted at the University College Hospital Blood Bank in Ibadan over a period of three months. A validated questionnaire, based on similar studies in Nigeria, was used to collect data from blood donors. The SPSS version 23 was used for data analysis, and the chi-square test of independence assessed associations between variables, with a significance level of 0.05. Results Among 205 donors, 68.8% were male, and 42.4% were in the age category of ≥25 years. Most donors (60.0%) were university students. While 12.3% had never heard of SCA, 79.5% were aware of their genotype. Regarding the intrauterine diagnosis of hemoglobin SS (HbSS), 20.0% would allow pregnancy, 31.7% would abort, and 48.3% were undecided. Most respondents (73.2%) had good knowledge of SCA (mean score = 7.0/10.0). If partners were found to have SCA after marriage, 42.9% were undecided. Knowledge of SCA was significantly associated with sex (p = 0.017) and education level (p = 0.001). Conclusion Blood donors in Ibadan have good knowledge, awareness, and attitudes toward SCA. However, more health education would benefit the population.","Sickle cell anemia (SCA) is a complex genetic condition caused by the presence of homozygous mutant hemoglobin SS genes (HbSS) [<xref rid=""REF1"" ref-type=""bibr"">1</xref>]. About 300,000 babies with SCA are born globally each year, most of them in Africa. More than half of these African children will die before the age of 5. Nigeria has the highest burden of the disease globally, affecting about 2% of its population [<xref rid=""REF1"" ref-type=""bibr"">1</xref>,<xref rid=""REF2"" ref-type=""bibr"">2</xref>]. Recent improvements in diagnosis and advancements in the management of SCA in children have led to better survival rates and an increased number of adult patients who require optimal care for the complications and morbid states associated with the condition [<xref rid=""REF3"" ref-type=""bibr"">3</xref>-<xref rid=""REF5"" ref-type=""bibr"">5</xref>]. The mutation in the hemoglobin gene causes crystallization and polymerization of hemoglobin, disrupting RBC structure and flexibility. These effects are responsible for the various crises in SCA and reduce the lifespan of the RBC to about 25 days in SCA patients [<xref rid=""REF6"" ref-type=""bibr"">6</xref>,<xref rid=""REF7"" ref-type=""bibr"">7</xref>]. One intervention to prevent the complications of SCA is by reducing the rate of HbS polymerization. Different therapeutic approaches following this mechanism have been developed, such as gene therapy, hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, the use of hydroxyurea, antioxidant, and anti-adhesive therapy. Several other interventions have been implemented, but their unwanted side effects, associated toxicities, questionable efficacy, and success rates have limited their optimal use [<xref rid=""REF8"" ref-type=""bibr"">8</xref>-<xref rid=""REF11"" ref-type=""bibr"">11</xref>]. However, blood transfusion is another therapeutic option with manageable complications. Research has shown that blood transfusion is one of the mainstays of treatment for most of the severe acute crises seen in SCA. It increases the oxygen-carrying capacity of blood and reduces the complications of vaso-occlusion [<xref rid=""REF12"" ref-type=""bibr"">12</xref>,<xref rid=""REF13"" ref-type=""bibr"">13</xref>]. However, this is affected by ineffective blood banking services and the apathy of blood donors towards donating blood. In a study by [<xref rid=""REF7"" ref-type=""bibr"">7</xref>], 75% of hospitals in Nigeria were unable to transfuse patients regularly due to blood scarcity, which is largely due to low availability and limited donors. It was also reported that a shortage of blood supply among other factors has limited the care of SCA patients [<xref rid=""REF3"" ref-type=""bibr"">3</xref>,<xref rid=""REF7"" ref-type=""bibr"">7</xref>]. With the high prevalence of SCA in Nigeria, there is a need to focus on primary prevention through public health education and enlightenment. This is crucial for individuals to make informed decisions about their reproductive life and other health-related choices [<xref rid=""REF14"" ref-type=""bibr"">14</xref>]. This study, hence, seeks to assess the level of knowledge and attitudes of blood donors in Ibadan, Nigeria, towards SCA patients. It also aims to evaluate the relationship between the socio-demographic characteristics (sex, occupation, and level of education) of the blood donors and their knowledge about SCA. This article was previously presented as an abstract poster at the International Research Centre of Excellence 2nd Annual Scientific Symposium on August 14, 2024. Study design The study was a descriptive cross-sectional study conducted among blood donors at the University College Hospital Blood Bank, Ibadan. It was carried out over three months, from April to June 2023. Study area The University College Hospital Blood Bank is one of the largest and most recognized blood banks in Ibadan, Nigeria. Located on the premises of the University College Hospital, the premier federal tertiary teaching hospital in Ibadan, the blood bank serves not only the hospital's patients but also those from several other hospitals in the city. Annually, the blood bank collaborates with various organizations, including the SmileBuilders Initiative, to organize several blood donation drives, such as the Donate-A-Pint project, where blood donors voluntarily donate blood. Study population For this study, the subjects included blood donors at the Donate-A-Pint project around the University College Hospital, Ibadan. After providing consent, participants were asked to fill out a printed questionnaire. Inclusion criteria Consenting blood donors for the Donate-A-Pint project at the donation site were included. Exclusion criteria Any donor outside the Donate-A-Pint project and those who refused to consent were excluded. Sample size determination The sample size for this study was estimated using the Yamane formula. The average monthly donor count at the University College Hospital Blood Bank over the last six months is 810. Using the Yamane formula: n = N / (1 + Ne^2); where n = sample size for your time frame, N = population size (estimated monthly donor count), and e = tolerance error. With a 10% contingency, the final minimum sample size (n) for this study was estimated to be 295 blood donors. Sampling technique All the blood donors who consented to participate were provided with a printed questionnaire to fill out at the blood donation locations. Data collection Data were collected using a self-administered validated printed questionnaire written in English, the official and widely spoken language at the study locations. It was also translated into Yoruba, the native language in Ibadan, Nigeria. Volunteers in the Donate-A-Pint Project made efforts to explain the questionnaire to participants who were unclear about parts of it and to ensure the forms were appropriately filled and collected before participants left the blood bank, to ensure optimal compliance. Two hundred and five (205) questionnaires were retrieved and subjected to statistical analysis. Study tool The structured self-administered questionnaire was designed and validated using questions from similar studies conducted in Nigeria [<xref rid=""REF15"" ref-type=""bibr"">15</xref>,<xref rid=""REF16"" ref-type=""bibr"">16</xref>]. The questionnaire comprised 23 questions divided into four sections: socio-demographic characteristics, awareness, attitude, and knowledge of the respondents. The socio-demographic section included the respondent’s age, gender, level of education, and religion. The knowledge section included questions on the common symptoms, diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of SCA, which were answered as either ‘Yes,’ ‘No,’ or ‘I don’t know.’ The respondents' attitudes were assessed using a three-point scale with responses such as ‘Yes,’ ‘No,’ and ‘Undecided.’ The questions addressed the objectives of the study. The questionnaire was pretested among 20 randomly selected blood donors from the previous donation drive to test the feasibility and efficiency of the questionnaire, and the data collected were not included in the study. Data analysis The data for the study were entered into a password-protected computer system, and the respondents' information was handled with confidentiality. Data were entered into Microsoft Office Excel 2016 and analyzed using the SPSS version 23. Descriptive analysis for categorical data was presented as frequencies and percentages, and continuous data were presented in means, standard deviations, and ranges. The Chi-squared test was used to assess the relationship between sociodemographic factors (sex, age range, education) and the level of knowledge, as well as the relationship between awareness and attitudes towards SCA. A p-value of ≤ 0.05 at a 95% CI was considered statistically significant. Sociodemographic features of study participants A total of 205 respondents participated in the study. Deferred donors were not included. The majority of the respondents were male (141, 68.8%) and were within the age category of ≥25 years (87, 42.4%). Of the studied population, 78.5% (161) were single, and 60% (123) were students. Most (140, 68%) of the respondents were voluntary blood donors, and 71.7% (147) were currently attaining tertiary education. Table <xref rid=""TAB1"" ref-type=""table"">1</xref> summarizes the socio-demographic features of the respondents. Awareness of blood donors to SCA Most (79.5%) of the respondents knew their genotype, and the majority (55.1%) had the Hb AA genotype. 87.8% had heard about sickle cell disease, and 52.2% knew people living with the condition. Moreover, 78.5% had correct knowledge of SCA being an inherited disorder. The summary of questions asked to demonstrate respondents' awareness of sickle cell disease is depicted in Table <xref rid=""TAB2"" ref-type=""table"">2</xref>. Attitude of blood donors to SCA The majority (86.3%) of the respondents were willing to opt for genetic counseling as a necessary precautionary attitude towards SCA. Most (73.2%) of the respondents were not willing to continue a relationship after discovering that they were at risk of having offspring with SCA, while 7.8% were willing to continue the relationship, and 19% were undecided. Almost 43% of the respondents were undecided on the action to take if they discovered that they or their partner has SCA after marriage. Also, 48.3% of the respondents were unsure of what they would do if they discovered that their unborn child has SCA following diagnosis, and 62.4% felt empathetic when they saw people living with SCA. The attitude of respondents towards sickle cell disease is as shown in Table <xref rid=""TAB3"" ref-type=""table"">3</xref>. Knowledge of blood donors about SCA More than 80% of the respondents know that bone pain is a common symptom of SCA. 71.7% know that yellowness of the eyes is a common symptom, 71.2% know that delayed growth is a common symptom, 59.5% know that swelling of hands and feet is a common symptom, and 82% know that easy fatiguability is a common symptom of SCA. About 83% believed that blood samples could be used to screen for SCA, while half (50.2%) did not know whether urine samples could be used for screening. Most (83.9%) respondents believed that anemia can be managed with medication and lifestyle changes, and 86.3% believed that premarital genotype screening can help in reducing the prevalence of SCA. Table <xref rid=""TAB4"" ref-type=""table"">4</xref> summarizes the level of knowledge of respondents about SCA. This study assessed the level of awareness, knowledge, and attitude of blood donors in Ibadan and their associations. Our analysis suggests that most of the donors had good knowledge of SCA, were aware of SCA, and showed a positive attitude towards SCA. Our finding shows that 73.2% of the participants had a good knowledge of SCA. This finding is consistent with studies conducted among similar participants across universities in the country, where a good knowledge of SCA was reported [<xref rid=""REF17"" ref-type=""bibr"">17</xref>,<xref rid=""REF18"" ref-type=""bibr"">18</xref>]. This result is expected, given that the participants are educated and have access to ample resources to acquire such knowledge. However, several other studies reported a low percentage of participants with good knowledge of SCA [<xref rid=""REF14"" ref-type=""bibr"">14</xref>,<xref rid=""REF19"" ref-type=""bibr"">19</xref>-<xref rid=""REF22"" ref-type=""bibr"">22</xref>]. While the difference in the reported level of knowledge could be due to differences among the groups and the assessment criteria, these people could be SCA carriers and are at risk of giving birth to children with SCA [<xref rid=""REF20"" ref-type=""bibr"">20</xref>]. We found that most of our participants were aware of SCA, and most (86.3%) were willing to perform genetic counseling. This agrees with the findings of similar studies where 77% and 85.4% of respondents, respectively, agreed to consider genetic counseling before marriage [<xref rid=""REF16"" ref-type=""bibr"">16</xref>,<xref rid=""REF20"" ref-type=""bibr"">20</xref>]. However, a significant percentage of the participants (42.9%) were undecided on what to do if either of their partners were found to have SCA after marriage. This is in contrast with other studies where most participants were willing to call off their marriages if discovered that their genotypes predispose them to having children with SCA [<xref rid=""REF16"" ref-type=""bibr"">16</xref>,<xref rid=""REF23"" ref-type=""bibr"">23</xref>]. Also, most of the participants (48.3%) were undecided on what to do if their unborn child has SCA following diagnosis. A similar occurrence was reported in a study where all the participants (100%) were undecided on what to do in such a situation [<xref rid=""REF16"" ref-type=""bibr"">16</xref>]. This might be because participants were unaware of the benefits of opting for prenatal screening, the legislation on the abortion of babies with SCA, and the otherwise painful and psychosocial trauma that affected children experience. Additionally, the 5.4% of participants who were unwilling to undergo genetic counseling and the 8.3% who were undecided emphasize the need for public enlightenment in the primary prevention of SCA. Findings from this study revealed that the participants’ age, religion, and occupation did not have a significant association with their level of knowledge about SCA. On the other hand, participants’ sex and level of education have significant associations. This is consistent with similar studies in Ghana where the level of knowledge of SCA was significantly associated with the level of education [<xref rid=""REF20"" ref-type=""bibr"">20</xref>,<xref rid=""REF23"" ref-type=""bibr"">23</xref>] and the sex of participants [<xref rid=""REF23"" ref-type=""bibr"">23</xref>]. However, a study conducted on undergraduates in Lagos reported no association with the level of knowledge of participants. Our study revealed a better knowledge score amongst male participants (46.3%), as compared to females (26.6%). This could be due to the larger number of male participants in the study. A similar finding was reported in a cross-sectional study amongst unmarried adults in Nigeria’s capital city [<xref rid=""REF24"" ref-type=""bibr"">24</xref>]. A limitation of this study is the small sample size, which may make generalizability questionable. The use of closed questions requiring respondents to choose among the options did not permit them to explain their answers, hence introducing some bias. The respondents of the study were mainly students and residents around the blood bank; hence the results may not accurately reflect the awareness, knowledge, and attitude towards SCA among the broader population of Ibadan residents. Most participants were aware of SCA. To ensure appropriate decisions and steps are taken on SCA-related issues, more efforts should be directed at public health education on SCA management. There is a need for sustained mass motivational campaigns on the importance of genetic counseling and blood donation among students, youths, and the general public. We recommend conducting regular continuous medical education and seminars on SCA to bridge knowledge gaps, dispel misconceptions, and promote efforts to control SCA.",N/A,25 9 2024
Outcome of Pediatric Patients With Sickle Cell Anemia Admitted With Fever: A Retrospective Single-Center Study,"Background: Pediatric patients with sickle cell anemia (SCA) are known to have an increased susceptibility to infections, leading to a higher incidence of fever among this population. However, there is limited literature specifically focusing on the outcomes of pediatric SCA patients presenting to the emergency department (ED) or hospital with a primary diagnosis of fever. Objectives: The objective of this retrospective single-center study was to compare the characteristics of fever and associated symptoms among pediatric patients with SCA, and to investigate the risk factors associated with patients' outcomes and mortality in this specific population. Patients and methods: The study was conducted at the King Salman Medical City, Maternity and Children's Hospital, Medina, Saudi Arabia, during the period from 2017 to 2022. All pediatric SCA patients under the age of 14, who presented to the ED of the hospital during the study period with a primary diagnosis of fever, were included. The study collected and analyzed clinical, laboratory, treatment, complications, and outcome data of the patients using appropriate statistical methods, including logistic regression. Results: A total of 57 children were included in the analysis. The mean age of the patients was 7.1 ± 4.3 years, with 26 males (45.6%) and 31 females (54.4%). Among the cases, 8 (14%) exhibited fever along with gastrointestinal symptoms, 18 (31.6%) presented with musculoskeletal symptoms, 5 (8.8%) showed neurological symptoms, and approximately half of the cases (45.6%) displayed respiratory symptoms along with fever. Logistic regression analysis identified several significant factors associated with complications in this sample, including a very low level of hemoglobin (Hb) (<7 g/dL) with an odds ratio (OR) of 14.5 (95% CI=1.03-222.3), ICU admission with OR of 14 (95% CI=1.03-186.8), and a hospital stay duration of more than 10 days (OR=11.5; 95% CI=1.10-121.3). Additionally, fever associated with neurological symptoms, neutrophilia, history of splenectomy, and male sex showed positive associations with complications among the studied patients, although not significant. Conclusion: This study provides valuable insights into the characteristics and outcomes of febrile pediatric patients with SCA. The findings highlight the importance of early recognition and management of fever in this vulnerable population, particularly when certain risk factors are present. ","Sickle cell disease (SCD) is an autosomal recessive genetic disorder caused by a single-point mutation in the β-chain of the hemoglobin (Hb) gene that results in the replacement of glutamic acid with valine in the Hb protein, resulting in hemoglobin S (HbS) formation [<xref rid=""REF1"" ref-type=""bibr"">1</xref>]. HbS is vulnerable to multiple stressful events that lead to deoxygenation and polymerization reactions, resulting in sickling of the red blood cells (RBCs) [<xref rid=""REF2"" ref-type=""bibr"">2</xref>]. RBCs with sickle-like morphology become more rigid and “sticky” compared to normal RBCs, causing frequent vaso-occlusive episodes and depriving tissues and organs of oxygen [<xref rid=""REF3"" ref-type=""bibr"">3</xref>].This process predisposes sickle cell patients to a variety of acute and chronic complications early in their lives. Sickle cell patients mostly present to the pediatric emergency department (ED) with fever caused by viral or bacterial infection, or sickle cell crisis [<xref rid=""REF4"" ref-type=""bibr"">4</xref>]. The underlying causes for these complications result from vascular occlusion, increased blood viscosity, leading to functional asplenia, and immune deficiency. This pathology leads to life-long increased susceptibility to serious bacterial infections [<xref rid=""REF5"" ref-type=""bibr"">5</xref>]. This is proven by some studies which show the incidence of bacterial infection in children with SCD globally is 16% compared to 3-14% in general children [<xref rid=""REF6"" ref-type=""bibr"">6</xref>]. Because of the high morbidity and mortality rate associated with bacterial infection, any patient presented to the pediatric ED with a febrile episode will require an immediate evaluation, including blood cultures and initiation of empiric antibiotics [<xref rid=""REF7"" ref-type=""bibr"">7</xref>]. There are a few studies that measure the outcome of fever in sickle cell patients one of them was done in Jeddah and it reported the rate of bacterial infection among pediatric patients presenting to the ED with fever to be 8.6% [<xref rid=""REF8"" ref-type=""bibr"">8</xref>]. Another study in the USA done over a period of 10 years found the rate of bacterial infection was 16% in febrile children with SCD [<xref rid=""REF6"" ref-type=""bibr"">6</xref>]. Genetic disorders such as SCD are very common in Saudi Arabia. Unfortunately, although the prevalence of SCD has been decreasing in every region of Saudi Arabia, the prevalence remains higher than that in other countries [<xref rid=""REF9"" ref-type=""bibr"">9</xref>]. In 2015, a high prevalence rate of 49.6% (45.8% for the trait and 3.8% for the disease) was reported in Saudi Arabia [<xref rid=""REF10"" ref-type=""bibr"">10</xref>] .This could be referred to the high percentage of consanguineous marriages in the country, which present a great obstacle in controlling SCD in Saudi Arabia [<xref rid=""REF2"" ref-type=""bibr"">2</xref>]. Considering the burden and prevalence of this disease, the Saudi government in 2004 directed its efforts toward the primary prevention of this disease through mandatory premarital screening and genetic counselling program (PMSGC) for all couples planning to marry. Couples who are at risk were offered genetic counselling. As a result, a five-fold increase in voluntary cancellation was observed among at-risk couples from 2004 to 2009 [<xref rid=""REF11"" ref-type=""bibr"">11</xref>]. Currently, there is a lack of data on the outcomes of febrile events in pediatric SCD patients in Medina. Consequently, we conducted this study to evaluate and assess their outcomes. This retrospective study follows a cross-sectional design and focuses on pediatric patients with sickle cell anemia (SCA) who were admitted to the King Salman Medical City, Maternity and Children's Hospital, Medina, Saudi Arabia, during the period from 2017 to 2022, with a primary diagnosis of fever. The study included all pediatric patients under the age of 14 years diagnosed with SCA and presented to the ED with a fever of 38°C and more during the study period. Fever was grouped into the following categories according to associated symptoms: fever with gastrointestinal symptoms, fever with musculoskeletal symptoms, fever with neurological symptoms, and fever with respiratory symptoms. Data extraction Relevant data were extracted from the electronic medical records system. The following information was included: Demographic characteristics: age, gender, and nationality. Clinical presentation included symptoms, clinical signs, heart rate, respiratory rate, and any associated symptoms. Laboratory findings included leukocyte count, neutrophils count, erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), Hb level, blood cultures, and other relevant laboratory tests. Hb level was classified as “low” (<10 g/dL), and “very low” (<7.9 g/dL). Treatment and management included antibiotic therapy, supportive care, and a history of blood transfusion and splenectomy. Length of hospital stay. The outcome data included the resolution of fever, complications during hospitalization, need for intensive care, and mortality. All outcome data were defined as a binary variable (Yes vs No). All predictors were collected prior to the occurrence of the complication at or during the time of hospital admission, ensuring that the temporal relationship between the predictors and the outcome is preserved. Ethical considerations This study followed ethical guidelines and regulations applicable to retrospective studies. The research proposal obtained approval from both the King Salman bin Abdelaziz Medical City Institutional Review Board (IRB log No: 023-026) and the Research Ethics Committee of Taibah University (IORG0008716-IRB00010413). The study prioritized the protection of data privacy and confidentiality, strictly utilizing the data for research purposes only. Statistical analysis Statistical analyses were performed using SPSS 22.0 for Windows (Chicago, USA). Data were presented using frequencies for categorical data and means and standard deviation (SD) for continuous data. The incidence of fever among the studied cases was tabulated and then compared by the studied patients' characteristics using chi-square, fisher exact, T-test, and ANOVA analysis as appropriate. The complication was also compared to the studied patients’ characteristics. Stepwise logistic regression analysis was also done (with an inclusion criterion of 10% and an exclusion criterion of 20%), to predict the most important factors associated with complications. The statistical significance level was set at p<0.05. This study enrolled a total of 57 children who were diagnosed with SCA. The average age of the participants was 7.1 ± 4.3 years, and 45.6% of them were younger than seven years old. Among the participants, 45.6% were male (n=2). The study findings revealed that tachycardia was present in 71.9% of the patients, while tachypnea was observed in 52.6% of them. Laboratory investigations indicated that 61.4% of the patients had low Hb levels, and 12.3% had very low Hb levels. Leukocytosis was found in 45.6% of the patients, neutrophilic in 14%, and high ESR in 43.9%. No cases showed positive blood culture in the sample.  Additionally, 28.1% of the participants had a history of splenectomy, 63.2% had received blood transfusions, 43.1% had received ospen prophylaxis, and 48.3% had received influenza vaccination. The mean duration of hospital stay was 7.4 ± 6.8 days, with four cases (7%) requiring admission to the ICU. Complications were observed in only four cases (7.1%); three cases with organ failure and one case of death (Table <xref rid=""TAB1"" ref-type=""table"">1</xref>). Table <xref rid=""TAB2"" ref-type=""table"">2</xref> presents the different manifestations of fever observed in the patients included in the study. Among the cases, 8 instances (14%) exhibited fever along with gastrointestinal symptoms, 18 cases (31.6%) presented fever along with musculoskeletal symptoms, 5 cases (8.8%) showed fever along with neurological symptoms, and approximately half of the cases (45.6%) displayed fever along with respiratory symptoms. The percent distribution of fever by associated symptoms is depicted in Figure <xref rid=""FIG1"" ref-type=""fig"">1</xref>. Table <xref rid=""TAB3"" ref-type=""table"">3</xref> shows the comparison of fever groups based on clinical and biological variables in the patients under study. Statistically significant differences were observed in various aspects, including the nationality of the patients, Hb levels, influenza vaccination, hydroxyurea (HU) usage, and the incidence of complications. However, no statistically significant differences were found for other variables examined. Fever accompanied by gastrointestinal symptoms was more prevalent in younger children, with an average age of 4.9 ± 2.9 years. It was also more common in patients who received influenza vaccination (75%), had a history of folic acid usage (100%), had a history of blood transfusion (75%), and had regular outpatient follow-up (87.5%). Fever associated with neurological symptoms was more prevalent among male patients (80%) and those with low Hb levels. Fever accompanied by respiratory symptoms was more prevalent in older children, with an average age of 7.7 ± 4.1 years. It was also more common in patients with low Hb levels (76.9%), a history of blood transfusion, regular outpatient follow-up (61.5%), folic acid usage (79.9%), and HU usage (73.1%). Patients with fever accompanied by respiratory symptoms had a longer mean length of hospital stay, while those with fever associated with neurological symptoms had a higher rate of ICU admission. Among the cases, three patients experienced organ failure (one in the fever with gastrointestinal symptoms group and two in the fever with musculoskeletal symptoms group), and one patient from the fever with neurological symptoms group unfortunately passed away. Table <xref rid=""TAB4"" ref-type=""table"">4</xref> displays the clinical and biological variables in the patients under study categorized by the presence of complications. Statistically significant differences were found between patients with complications and those without complications in terms of their Hb levels, history of blood transfusion, receiving ospen prophylaxis, ICU admission, and length of hospital stay. However, no statistically significant differences were observed for other variables examined. The logistic regression analysis revealed several factors that were examined as predictors of complications. Although not statistically significant, fever associated with neurological symptoms, neutrophilia, history of splenectomy, and male sex showed positive associations with complications, with odds ratio (OR) of 1.80, 2.50, 10.8, and 3.90, respectively. Among the predictors, the most significant factors associated with complications in this sample were a very low level of Hb (<7 g/dL), which had an OR of 14.5 (95% CI=1.03-222.3), ICU admission with an OR of 14 (95% CI=1.03-186.8), and duration of hospital stay>10 days (OR=11.5; 95% CI=1.10-121.3). Although not significant, a history of outpatient follow-up was associated with a 90% reduction in the risk of complications (OR=0.10; 95% CI=0.39-40.5), and the use of ceftriaxone antibiotic was associated with a 73% reduction in the risk of complications (Table <xref rid=""TAB5"" ref-type=""table"">5</xref>). SCA represents a major global healthcare burden and contributes significantly to patient morbidity and mortality. This study aimed to compare the characteristics of fever and associated symptoms among pediatric patients with SCA, and to investigate the risk factors associated with patients' outcomes and mortality. The study included 57 children under the age of 14 years. No cases showed positive blood culture the studied sample. Similarly, the rate of bacteremia was also low and ranged from 1.2% to 1.5% in previously published similar studies [<xref rid=""REF12"" ref-type=""bibr"">12</xref>,<xref rid=""REF13"" ref-type=""bibr"">13</xref>]. Inconsistent with these results, however, was the rate of positive culture and bacteremia among febrile children with SCA: it was as high as 2.6% [<xref rid=""REF7"" ref-type=""bibr"">7</xref>]. The rate was found to range from 1.3% to 3.6% in the earlier studies, higher than other recent publications [<xref rid=""REF7"" ref-type=""bibr"">7</xref>,<xref rid=""REF14"" ref-type=""bibr"">14</xref>,<xref rid=""REF15"" ref-type=""bibr"">15</xref>]. All outcome data were defined as a binary variable (Yes vs No). All predictors were collected prior to the occurrence of the complication at or during the time of hospital admission, ensuring that the temporal relationship between the predictors and the outcome is preserved. The higher prevalence of bacteremia in these earlier studies may be influenced by factors such as regional differences in healthcare delivery, variations in clinical practice guidelines, and patient population characteristics, including age, comorbidities, and access to healthcare resources. Furthermore, the time of culture could be attributed to these observed variations. Two previous studies have identified that the mean time to a positive blood culture in SCA febrile patients was 17-23 hours and 96% of the cases would be identified within 48 hours [<xref rid=""REF7"" ref-type=""bibr"">7</xref>,<xref rid=""REF16"" ref-type=""bibr"">16</xref>]. Moreover, it is worth noting that temperature alone was not a reliable indicator for identifying bacteremia cases, as only a small percentage of the cases had temperatures exceeding 40°C or 39.5°C. This highlights the challenges in developing admission criteria for patients with SCA based solely on fever [<xref rid=""REF7"" ref-type=""bibr"">7</xref>].  The study findings revealed that gastrointestinal symptoms were reported in 14% of the cases presenting with fever. These symptoms may include abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea. The presence of gastrointestinal symptoms alongside fever suggested the possibility of an underlying infection involving the gastrointestinal tract, such as gastroenteritis or abdominal infections.Patients with SCA are found to present with a wide variety of gastrointestinal disorders mimicking vaso-occlusive episodes causing diagnostic confusion, and most of these patients present with fever [<xref rid=""REF17"" ref-type=""bibr"">17</xref>].  Musculoskeletal symptoms were observed in 36.4% of the cases who presenting with fever. Musculoskeletal manifestations of fever in patients with SCA can be indicative of acute bone or joint infections, which can have serious consequences if not promptly diagnosed and treated. In a study on 85 children with SCA, 31 patients had musculoskeletal complications, giving a prevalence rate of 36.4%. The most common musculoskeletal complication was vascular necrosis, followed by septic arthritis and chronic osteomyelitis [<xref rid=""REF18"" ref-type=""bibr"">18</xref>]. The increased susceptibility of SCD patients to musculoskeletal manifestations has long been recognized, with several mechanisms postulated, including chronic sequelae of the anemia and vaso-occlusive processes involving the musculoskeletal system [<xref rid=""REF19"" ref-type=""bibr"">19</xref>]. Neurological symptoms were reported in 8.8% of the cases presenting with fever. The presence of neurological symptoms alongside fever raises concerns about potential complications such as central nervous system infections or cerebrovascular events in patients with SCA. Neurological complications have been reported in a previous study, and that study recommended increasing recognition of neurological complications among SCA patients to improve diagnosis and treatment options [<xref rid=""REF20"" ref-type=""bibr"">20</xref>]. Respiratory symptoms were observed in approximately half (45.6%) of the cases with fever. Respiratory manifestations of fever in patients with SCA can be indicative of respiratory tract infections, including pneumonia or acute chest syndrome, which is a serious complication in these patients. The most common single specific pulmonary complication of SCD at all ages is acute pulmonary involvement compatible with bacterial pneumonia evidenced clinically by cough, fever, leukocytosis, pleuritic pain, and occasional dyspnea [<xref rid=""REF21"" ref-type=""bibr"">21</xref>]. The diverse range of manifestations observed in this study highlights the complexity of febrile episodes in pediatric patients with SCA. It emphasizes the importance of a thorough clinical evaluation to identify the underlying cause of fever and associated symptoms to provide appropriate and timely interventions. Prompt recognition and management of specific manifestations, such as gastrointestinal, musculoskeletal, neurological, or respiratory symptoms, are crucial for optimizing patient outcomes and preventing complications in this vulnerable population. The study findings revealed that complications were more prevalent among younger and male patients and in cases of fever associated with musculoskeletal symptoms. Among the antibiotics used, ceftriaxone was associated with 25% of the complications, while the other used antibiotics showed a 50% association, although this difference was not statistically significant. Ceftriaxone and cefotaxime have been recommended for the treatment of septic episodes in SCA associated with <italic toggle=""yes"">S. pneumoniae</italic>, Haemophilus, and Salmonella spp. infection with Yersinia enterocolitica may be treated with cefotaxime [<xref rid=""REF22"" ref-type=""bibr"">22</xref>]. Also, the use of HU was associated with a decrease in complications. HU is a very essential drug for the care of SCA patients. Almost all major society guidelines recommend HU, and the label is extended to cover a wide range of indications in both children and adults. Long-term follow-up has shown safety, efficacy, decreased morbidity, and improved survival [<xref rid=""REF23"" ref-type=""bibr"">23</xref>]. The significant factor associated with complications in patients with SCA in this study was an extremely low level of Hb (<7 g/dL). Patients with SCA who had severely low Hb levels had 14.5 times higher odds of experiencing complications compared to those with higher Hb levels. This finding underscores the importance of monitoring and managing Hb levels in SCA patients, as low Hb levels can contribute to disease severity and increase the risk of complications. Because sickled cells are short-lived or destroyed, there are fewer RBCs available in the body. This results in anemia. Severe anemia can make patients more susceptible to infections and complications [<xref rid=""REF24"" ref-type=""bibr"">24</xref>]. In the present study, ICU admission was identified as a significant predictor of complications. Patients who required ICU admission had a 14 times higher odds of experiencing complications compared to those who did not require ICU care. This emphasizes the severity of illness in patients with SCA who necessitate intensive care and suggests that close monitoring and specialized interventions are crucial in managing these cases. Several previous studies have reported concurring findings of increased risk of complications and mortality among SCA patients admitted to the ICU. In addition, five-year mortality is linked with a history of long ICU stay [<xref rid=""REF25"" ref-type=""bibr"">25</xref>,<xref rid=""REF26"" ref-type=""bibr"">26</xref>]. In the present study, a longer duration of hospital stay (> 10 days) was also found to be significantly associated with complications. Patients with SCA who had extended hospital stays had an 11.5 times higher odds of experiencing complications. Prolonged hospitalization may be an indicator of more severe disease, increased susceptibility to infections, or the presence of other complications requiring ongoing medical management [<xref rid=""REF27"" ref-type=""bibr"">27</xref>].  Although not statistically significant, the study observed that a history of outpatient follow-up was associated with a 90% reduction in the risk of complications. In a previous case-control study on 30 cases (re-admitted) and 70 controls (non-re-admitted). The greatest risk factor for readmission was no outpatient hematology follow-up in within 30 days of discharge with an OR of 7.7 (95% CI=2.4-24) [<xref rid=""REF28"" ref-type=""bibr"">28</xref>]. This finding suggests that regular and consistent follow-up care may contribute to better disease management and early detection of potential complications, leading to improved patient outcomes. Additionally, the use of ceftriaxone antibiotic was associated with a 73% reduction in the risk of complications. This suggests that appropriate antibiotic therapy, such as ceftriaxone, may play a role in preventing or managing infectious complications in patients with SCA. Although not significant, neutrophilia, history of splenectomy, and male sex showed positive associations with complications among the studied patients. In a previous study increased white blood cells was associated with complications of SCA patients with fever [<xref rid=""REF7"" ref-type=""bibr"">7</xref>]. Neutrophilia is often seen in response to infection or inflammation, and an exaggerated neutrophil response may indicate a more severe inflammatory process in SCA patients with fever. Also, the absence of the spleen compromises the immune system's ability to fight infections, making splenectomized individuals more susceptible to certain bacterial infections, and there is growing concern about overwhelming post-splenectomy infection caused by encapsulated bacteria. [<xref rid=""REF29"" ref-type=""bibr"">29</xref>]. Finally, the finding that male sex is associated with complications among SCA patients with fever suggests that male patients may be at higher risk compared to females. However, it is important to note that the reasons for this association may be multifactorial and not solely due to sex itself. Other factors, such as hormonal differences, genetic factors, or varying healthcare-seeking behaviour, could contribute to this association. Furthermore, the lack of statistical significance in these associations may be attributed to the relatively small sample size or inherent variability in the population studied, and future research with larger sample sizes or alternative methodologies may provide clearer insights into the relationship between these variables and the occurrence of complications. The strengths of the study include being the first to investigate this topic at the King Salman Medical City, Maternity and Children's Hospital, Medina, Saudi Arabia, based on the available literature. Moreover, the current study evaluated SCA patients with fever by the associated organ symptoms group and studied several risk factors in association with complications among these patients. Additionally, this study will provide valuable insights into the outcomes of pediatric patients with SCA admitted with fever, contributing to the understanding of managing this particular population and potentially guiding future research and clinical practices. However, there are also some limitations to the study that should be considered. The retrospective nature of the present study may introduce inherent biases and limitations in data collection. The findings may be limited to a specific center and may not be generalizable to other settings or populations. Missing or incomplete medical records may affect the availability of certain data points. The very wide confidence intervals observed in this analysis were the result of the small sample size and the small number of cases included in the studied cells. Therefore, extensive longitudinal studies would be more suitable for further exploring the dynamic nature of these associations over time and assessing causality.  This study provides valuable insights into the characteristics and outcomes of febrile pediatric patients with SCA. The findings emphasize the importance of early recognition and management of fever in this vulnerable population, particularly in the presence of certain risk factors. They highlight the clinical factors that significantly influence complications in patients with SCA. Further research and larger-scale studies are needed to validate these findings and explore additional factors that may contribute to complications in this patient population.",N/A,17 9 2024
Stroke Prevention and Treatment for Youth with Sickle Cell Anemia: Current Practice and Challenges and Promises for the Future,," While a detailed review of acute stroke management is beyond the scope of this review, there are important differences in the acute management of stroke in those with SCA, especially for children. If a child with SCA presents with primarily small vessel disease, this likely is mediated by the amount of sickled cells in their circulation. A critical step in treatment is the reduction of HbS% to < 15% in the circulation. This is most efficiently and effectively performed by exchange transfusion, but this requires specialized resources that may not be available in smaller community hospitals. In that case and for children with significant anemia (e.g., Hb < 9 g/dL) HbS% can be acutely lowered with a simple transfusion, while efforts to arrange exchange transfusion and/or transfer to a center that can perform this are under way. Also, children with SCA typically do not have the risk factors for stroke that are seen in adults. Therefore, current guidelines recommend against intravenous tissue plasminogen activator in children with SCA. In young adults with SCA, intravenous thrombolysis is a consideration, particularly if additional risk factors for stroke are present, but transfusion is still a key element for acute management [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR29"">29</xref>]. While endovascular thrombectomy has opened up considerable opportunities for the treatment of ischemic strokes due to large vessels occlusions, [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR41"">41</xref>, <xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR42"">42</xref>] endovascular thrombectomy in children and young adults with SCA should be pursued cautiously given the association of moyamoya syndrome and SCA. SCA related moyamoya vasculopathy can involve large vessels such as the internal carotid artery, middle cerebral artery, or anterior cerebral arteries, and the M1 branch of the middle cerebral artery. Cannulation of a moyamoya stenotic vessel may risk a perforation or dissection, yet these moyamoya-associated large vessel occlusions may be difficult to distinguish from large vessel occlusions due to another cause. The presence of multiple lenticulostriate or thalamostriate collaterals may serve as additional warning that moyamoya syndrome may be present and if endovascular thrombectomy is considered in patients with SCA, the interventionalist should be made aware that the patient has SCA and that there is a possibility of moyamoya vasculopathy [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR43"">43</xref>].  Moyamoya syndrome is a severe complication of SCA marked by progressive stenosis and occlusion of the large cerebral vessels. Typically, the carotid or middle cerebral arteries are affected although the anterior and posterior cerebral arteries may also be involved. The pathophysiology contributing to the development of moyamoya syndrome in SCA is poorly understood, [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR50"">50</xref>] although hemoglobin polymerization, chronic hemolysis, release of free hemoglobin into the circulation, and activation of pro-inflammatory mediators likely contribute [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR51"">51</xref>]. Concurrent with the occlusion of the large cerebral arteries, small collateral lenticulo- and thalamostriate vessels often develop. Moyamoya syndrome may develop gradually and present with nothing more evident than progressively worsening headaches. The vasculopathy may not be identified until the patient presents with a hemorrhagic or ischemic stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA). Occasionally, though, moyamoya syndrome may be identified in an asymptomatic patient who has an MRI and MRA because of either a significantly elevated (≥ 200 cm/sec) or decreased (< 50 cm/sec) TAMMV on transcranial ultrasound. Because moyamoya syndrome increases the risk for multiple types of strokes, a number of surgical procedures have been proposed that collectively can be described as revascularization surgeries. Multiple retrospective studies [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR23"">23</xref>, <xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR52"">52</xref>–<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR54"">54</xref>] have reported a decreased rate of acute strokes, TIA, and SCI in patients with SCA and moyamoya syndrome who had revascularization surgery in addition to medical management. Acknowledging the limitations of this evidence and that there are no trials that directly compare chronic transfusions alone with chronic transfusions and surgical revascularization, current guidelines recommend that those with moyamoya syndrome and a history of stroke or TIA be evaluated for revascularization surgery, in addition to continuing chronic transfusion to prevent the progression of the steno-occlusive process [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR29"">29</xref>]. The optimal medical management of moyamoya syndrome is uncertain. Antiplatelet medications such as aspirin or clopidgrel are frequently used as anti-thrombotic agents although there is no trial-based evidence that supports their use. A small number of studies have shown that HSCT was associated with a) decreased transcranial Doppler velocities more than chronic transfusion [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR55"">55</xref>]; b) a stabilization of the progression of cerebrovascular disease [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR56"">56</xref>]; and c) an improvement in cerebral blood flow and oxygen extraction [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR40"">40</xref>]. This raises the possibility of HSCT as an alternative treatment for moyamoya syndrome that should be explored further. The role of gene therapy remains unknown, as gene therapy trials have included only a few patients with a history of stroke [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR57"">57</xref>, <xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR58"">58</xref>]. The concerns with stroke risk and the need for monitoring for the development of SCI continue into young adulthood. The management of young adults with SCA becomes more complicated as these individuals transition from a pediatric system designed to support children and adolescents with SCA to the adult care system [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR60"">60</xref>]. There is limited data regarding the longitudinal outcomes in young adults with SCA. Data from Kassim et al. [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR61"">61</xref>] showed that 9 of 69 (13%) young adults with SCA who had a MRI had symptomatic strokes. After removing the 9 stroke patients from the analysis, of the remaining 60 patients 32 (46%) had at least one silent infarct, and of 55 of the 60 who had MRAs performed, 5 (9%) had saccular aneurysms < 5 mm in size. None of the patients in this series had moyamoya vasculopathy, but of the 9 who were excluded from the analysis because of known strokes 5 had moyamoya vasculopathy. In a follow-up study of 54 of these patients, no new symptomatic strokes occurred, but of the patients who had pre-existing SCI 30% developed new or progressive SCI. In contrast only 6% of patients who did not have a pre-existing SCI developed an SCI. The use of hydroxyurea, the dose of hydroxyurea, and the presence of other stroke factors had no significant effect upon the development of SCI [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR62"">62</xref>]. A third two-site study reported that 50% of adults (median age 26 yrs) had SCI [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR63"">63</xref>]. Together, these three studies show that young adults with SCA have a high risk for stroke and SCI despite available treatment. Based upon these findings, current guidelines recommend that adults with HbSS or HbSβ<sup>0</sup> thalassemia have at least one MRI to screen for SCIs. Since SCIs may present with cognitive or behavior impairment alone, young adults should be regularly screened for emerging declines. If positive, then a MRI to look for SCI would be appropriate. In addition, referral to a provider such as a psychologist who can provide more detailed assessment of cognitive function would be appropriate [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR64"">64</xref>]. The emerging opportunities in gene therapy, which involves autologous transplantation of genetically modified hematopoietic stem cells, and more recently approved medications raise the question whether these might affect cerebrovascular disease and its management in children with SCA. However, this progress may come slowly. For instance, while a number of studies of gene therapy for sickle cell disease are actively recruiting in the United States, most exclude people with cerebrovascular disease [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR44"">44</xref>]. Therefore, current trials may not provide information regarding the role of gene therapy for primary and secondary stroke prevention in SCA. Furthermore, multiple disease modifying medications have been approved in the last decade, but their role in the modification of cerebrovascular disease is still investigational. For instance, voxelotor stabilizes HbS in the oxygenated state to inhibit Hb polymerization and erythrocyte sickling [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR65"">65</xref>]. Two active trials in children are examining the effect of voxelotor on transcranial Doppler velocities. (HOPE Kids; ClinicalTrials.gov NCT02850406), (HOPE Kids 2 study; ClinicalTrials.gov NCT04218084). In contrast, crizanlizumab (SelG1) downregulates endothelial expression of P-selectin, thereby reducing inflammation-mediated cell adhesion, vaso-occlusive episodes, and acute chest syndrome episodes in patients with sickle cell disease [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR66"">66</xref>]. Cerebrovascular complications were not an endpoint of the initial trial, but a single site study is recruiting to examine crizanlizumab’s effect on SCI (Clinicaltrials.gov NCT05334576). A neurologist evaluating a child or young adult with SCA should have a heightened level of suspicion for the possibility of neurological complications. The patient presenting with an acute stroke or a clear TIA is diagnostically obvious, but we have presented several scenarios where one needs to consider SCA as an underlying diagnosis and/or contributor to a neurological presentation. This includes presentations that may not involve a typical neurologic finding but more subtle symptoms including deteriorating behavior, attention, or cognition. Furthermore, while children with SCA can develop common problems such as headaches and migraines just like other children, it is critical to recognize that these may also be related to cerebrovascular disease [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR67"">67</xref>]. While the results of major clinical trials led to major advances in the prevention and management of SCA-related cerebrovascular disease in children there remain significant gaps in our knowledge that limit the long-term management of SCA, especially in adolescents and young adults. For example, what is the optimal management and treatment for young adults with SCA and stroke? How long and how frequently should one monitor these adults for the development of SCI? Also, how long and how frequently should patients with moyamoya vasculopathy be monitored, especially those with clinically asymptomatic aneurysms? One hopes that with time, the recently approved treatments for SCA provide opportunities for more effective modulation or suppression of cerebrovascular complications.

8194 Extramedullary Hematopoiesis Involving Bilateral Adrenal Glands In A Patient With Sickle Cell Anemia,"
<bold>Disclosure: V.T. Pham:</bold> None. <bold>L.N. Sendos:</bold> None. Title: Extramedullary hematopoiesis involving bilateral adrenal glands in a patient with sickle cell anemia <bold>Background:</bold> Extramedullary hematopoiesis refers to blood cell production occurring outside the bone marrow. It is a reactive process caused by inadequate production or excessive destruction of blood cells typically seen in patients with hereditary anemias or infiltrative bone marrow disorders. Extramedullary hematopoiesis usually occurs in the spleen, liver and lymph nodes, but it can also very rarely arise from the adrenal glands. Case Presentation:We present a case of a 42-year-old male with a history of sickle cell anemia who presented with chest pain and shortness of breath and had a chest CT angiography which incidentally showed a 5.6 x 3.8 cm left adrenal mass and a 2.9 x 2.1 cm right adrenal mass. Further evaluation with an MRI abdomen with and without contrast revealed a 5.5 cm lobulated left adrenal mass with patchy areas of microscopic fat and faint delayed heterogeneous enhancement as well as a 2.2 cm right adrenal nodule. The nodules were described as markedly T2 hypointense with heterogeneous T1 hyperintense/isointense signal on MRI with a broad differential diagnosis including extramedullary hematopoiesis in bilateral adrenal glands, lipid poor adenoma or neoplasm. Regarding his sickle cell disease history, the patient was diagnosed as an infant and had very rare episodes of sickle cell pain crisis as a child. However, once he entered adulthood, he began to have multiple episodes of sickle cell pain crisis requiring hospitalizations and transfusions. On further review of patient’s prior imaging scans during these previous hospitalizations, he was first noted to have bilateral sub centimeter adrenal nodules on a CT Abdomen without contrast done almost a decade prior to his current presentation. We ordered biochemical evaluation which did not show any evidence of adrenal hormonal hypersecretion. His case was discussed at our multidisciplinary conference with the radiology and surgery team and it was concluded that the imaging characteristics were most consistent with extramedullary hematopoiesis in the setting of bilateral adrenal gland involvement and patient’s history of sickle cell anemia. Therefore, no immediate surgical resection was recommended. Given the size of the left adrenal mass being greater than 4 cm in size, we advised follow-up imaging for surveillance. Discussion:There has been a rise in detection of adrenal incidentalomas due to the increased use of advanced diagnostic imaging in healthcare settings. When patients with hematologic diseases are found to have adrenal incidentalomas, it is important to consider extramedullary hematopoiesis in the differential diagnosis to avoid unnecessary invasive procedures and surgeries.

Advancing life: innovative approaches to enhance survival in sickle cell anemia patients,"Sickle cell anemia (SCA) is a severe genetic disorder characterized by the production of abnormal hemoglobin S, leading to the formation of sickle-shaped red blood cells that cause chronic anemia, pain, and organ damage. This review explores recent innovative strategies aimed at improving survival rates and quality of life for SCA patients. Genetic therapies, particularly gene editing with CRISPR-Cas9 and gene therapy using lentiviral vectors, have shown significant potential in correcting the genetic defects responsible for SCA. Clinical trials demonstrate that these approaches can reduce sickle cell crises and minimize the need for blood transfusions by enabling the production of healthy red blood cells. Novel pharmacological treatments such as voxelotor, crizanlizumab, and L-glutamine provide additional mechanisms to prevent hemoglobin polymerization, reduce vaso-occlusive episodes, and decrease oxidative stress, respectively. These therapies offer new hope for patients, particularly those who do not respond adequately to existing treatments. Improved blood transfusion protocols, including automated red cell exchange and advanced donor-matching techniques, have enhanced the safety and efficacy of transfusions, reducing complications like alloimmunization. Comprehensive care models, integrating multidisciplinary care teams, patient education, and telemedicine, have further contributed to better disease management. By providing holistic care that addresses both medical and psychosocial needs, these models improve patient adherence to treatment and overall health outcomes. This review highlights the importance of these innovative strategies and calls for continued research and development to sustain and expand these advancements in SCA care.","Sickle cell disease is a genetic disorder affecting the red blood cells in the body. Normally, red blood cells are round and flexible, allowing them to move easily through blood vessels, but in individuals with sickle cell disease, the red blood cells become rigid and take on a crescent or sickle shape. These abnormally shaped cells can get stuck in small blood vessels, leading to blockages that cause pain, organ damage, and a range of other complications<sup><xref rid=""R1"" ref-type=""bibr"">1</xref>,<xref rid=""R2"" ref-type=""bibr"">2</xref></sup>. SCD is caused by a mutation in the gene that instructs the body to make hemoglobin, the molecule in red blood cells that carries oxygen. This mutation causes the production of abnormal hemoglobin known as hemoglobin S (HbS). When oxygen levels are low or when the blood cells are exposed to stress, the HbS molecules can cause the red blood cells to become stiff and form the characteristic sickle shape<sup><xref rid=""R3"" ref-type=""bibr"">3</xref>,<xref rid=""R4"" ref-type=""bibr"">4</xref></sup>. There are different types of sickle cell disease, with the most common being sickle cell anemia (SS), where an individual inherits two copies of the abnormal gene (one from each parent). Other forms include hemoglobin SC disease (HbSC) and sickle beta-thalassemia (SBthal), where an individual inherits one copy of the abnormal gene along with another abnormal gene or a gene mutation<sup><xref rid=""R5"" ref-type=""bibr"">5</xref>,<xref rid=""R6"" ref-type=""bibr"">6</xref></sup>. SCD can lead to various health problems such as anemia, increased susceptibility to infections, organ damage, stroke, acute pain crises known as sickle cell crises, and other complications. Management and treatment strategies include medications, blood transfusions, hydroxyurea, pain management, and sometimes bone marrow or stem cell transplants aimed at alleviating symptoms and reducing complications<sup><xref rid=""R7"" ref-type=""bibr"">7</xref></sup>. It’s a condition that requires ongoing medical care and attention, and research into new treatments and potential cures is ongoing. Efforts to raise awareness, improve access to care, and provide support to individuals and families affected by SCD are essential in managing this condition effectively. Managing sickle cell disease (SCD) poses several significant challenges due to its complex nature and the wide range of potential complications associated with the condition. Sickle cell crises can cause severe and unpredictable pain episodes. These episodes often require immediate medical attention and pain management, which may include medications, hydration, and sometimes hospitalization<sup><xref rid=""R8"" ref-type=""bibr"">8</xref></sup>. SCD can affect various organs and systems in the body, leading to complications such as stroke, acute chest syndrome, pulmonary hypertension, kidney damage, vision problems, and more. Treating and preventing these complications require a multidisciplinary approach involving specialists in different medical fields<sup><xref rid=""R9"" ref-type=""bibr"">9</xref></sup>. Historically, treatment options for SCD have been limited. While certain medications like hydroxyurea can help reduce the frequency of pain crises, not all patients respond to these treatments, and they might not be suitable for everyone<sup><xref rid=""R8"" ref-type=""bibr"">8</xref></sup>. Access to specialized care for individuals with SCD can be challenging, especially in areas with limited healthcare resources or in communities with disparities in healthcare access. This lack of access can lead to inadequate management and increased complications<sup><xref rid=""R9"" ref-type=""bibr"">9</xref></sup>. SCD can significantly impact a person’s quality of life. Chronic pain, frequent hospitalizations, and potential disabilities can lead to emotional stress, depression, and anxiety. Patients often require mental health support along with medical care. As individuals with SCD transition from pediatric to adult healthcare settings, they might face difficulties in maintaining consistent and comprehensive care. This transition can lead to gaps in care and challenges in managing the disease effectively. There’s a need for continued research and the development of new therapies, including potential gene-based treatments or stem cell transplantation, to offer more effective and curative options for those living with SCD<sup><xref rid=""R10"" ref-type=""bibr"">10</xref></sup>. Lack of awareness among both healthcare providers and the general population about SCD can result in delayed diagnosis, inadequate care, and stigmatization of individuals affected by the disease<sup><xref rid=""R11"" ref-type=""bibr"">11</xref></sup>. Addressing these challenges requires a holistic approach involving healthcare providers, researchers, policymakers, and community organizations to improve access to care, develop better treatment options, raise awareness, and provide support for individuals and families affected by SCD. SCD can lead to a high mortality rate due to various factors associated with the condition. SCD can cause damage to various organs in the body, including the lungs, kidneys, liver, and brain. Over time, this damage can become severe and lead to organ failure, contributing to a higher mortality rate<sup><xref rid=""R12"" ref-type=""bibr"">12</xref></sup>. Individuals with SCD have weakened immune systems, making them more susceptible to infections. Certain infections, particularly in those with compromised immune systems, can be severe and life-threatening. SCD is characterized by episodes of acute pain known as sickle cell crises, which can be extremely severe and require immediate medical attention. If not managed promptly and effectively, these crises can lead to serious complications or even death. People with SCD are at a higher risk of experiencing a stroke, particularly at a younger age. Strokes can cause severe disabilities or can be fatal<sup><xref rid=""R10"" ref-type=""bibr"">10</xref></sup>. Historically, treatment options for SCD have been limited. While certain treatments, such as hydroxyurea, can help manage the disease, not all patients respond well to these therapies. Additionally, access to specialized care and treatments can be limited in certain regions or communities, leading to inadequate management of the disease<sup><xref rid=""R13"" ref-type=""bibr"">13</xref></sup>. Disparities in healthcare access, socioeconomic factors, and healthcare provider awareness can lead to delays in diagnosis, inadequate care, and poorer health outcomes for individuals with SCD, contributing to a higher mortality rate. The chronic pain, frequent hospitalizations, and potential disabilities associated with SCD can lead to emotional stress, mental health issues, and poor quality of life, which might indirectly contribute to a higher mortality rate<sup><xref rid=""R14"" ref-type=""bibr"">14</xref></sup>. Reducing the mortality rate associated with SCD requires a multifaceted approach that involves improving access to comprehensive care, enhancing awareness among healthcare providers and the public, developing better treatment options, providing adequate support for mental health, and addressing healthcare disparities to ensure timely and effective management of the disease. Advances in research, increased education, and better access to specialized care can significantly impact the mortality rate for individuals living with SCD. Table <xref rid=""T1"" ref-type=""table"">1</xref> shows summary of the Review (provided by the authors). The primary aim of this review article is to explore and elucidate innovative strategies that have demonstrated potential in improving the survival rates and quality of life for patients with sickle cell anemia (SCA). SCA is a debilitating genetic disorder that imposes significant morbidity and mortality burdens on affected individuals, particularly in regions with limited healthcare resources. Despite advancements in medical research and treatment, SCA continues to present substantial challenges in its management due to its complex pathophysiology and the variability of its clinical manifestations. The need for innovative and effective treatment strategies is paramount to improve survival rates and the quality of life for SCA patients. Traditional treatments for SCA, such as hydroxyurea and regular blood transfusions, primarily focus on managing symptoms rather than addressing the underlying genetic defect. Genetic therapies, including gene editing and gene therapy, offer the potential to correct the root cause of SCA at the molecular level. The rapid advancements in technologies like CRISPR-Cas9 and lentiviral vectors have opened new avenues for potentially curative treatments. By exploring these cutting-edge approaches, this review aims to highlight the transformative potential of genetic therapies in SCA management. The introduction of novel pharmacological agents such as voxelotor, crizanlizumab, and L-glutamine has broadened the therapeutic landscape for SCA. These medications target different aspects of the disease’s pathophysiology, offering new mechanisms of action that can complement existing treatments. Reviewing these pharmacological advancements provides insights into how these drugs can reduce complications, enhance patient outcomes, and offer alternative options for those who do not respond adequately to traditional therapies. Blood transfusions remain a cornerstone in the management of severe SCA complications. However, the risks associated with alloimmunization and iron overload necessitate improved transfusion protocols. Innovations such as automated red cell exchange and extended phenotype matching have significantly enhanced the safety and efficacy of transfusions. Evaluating these protocols underscores their importance in reducing adverse effects and improving the long-term health of SCA patients. Effective management of SCA requires a holistic approach that addresses both medical and psychosocial aspects of the disease. Multidisciplinary care teams, patient education, self-management strategies, and telemedicine are crucial components of comprehensive care models that can significantly enhance patient outcomes. By assessing these integrated care approaches, this review aims to highlight the importance of a coordinated and patient-centered strategy in managing SCA. Despite the progress made in SCA treatment, there remain gaps in research and clinical practice that need to be addressed. This review aims to identify these gaps and suggest future directions for research and healthcare policy. By doing so, it seeks to provide a roadmap for continued advancements and improvements in the management of SCA. The review methodology outlines the systematic approach used to gather, evaluate, and synthesize information on innovative strategies to improve survival rates in SCA patients. This methodology ensures the comprehensiveness and reliability of the findings presented in the review.  Based on the comprehensive review of innovative strategies to improve survival rates in SCA patients, the following recommendations are proposed: SCA remains a significant global health challenge, with profound impacts on patient morbidity and mortality. This review has highlighted various innovative strategies aimed at improving survival rates and the quality of life for individuals with SCA. Genetic therapies, such as CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing and lentiviral gene therapy, offer groundbreaking potential to address the root causes of the disease, providing hope for curative treatments. Novel pharmacological agents like voxelotor, crizanlizumab, and L-glutamine have expanded the therapeutic arsenal, offering new mechanisms to reduce complications and enhance patient outcomes.

Potassium dynamics in sickle cell anemia: clinical implications and pathophysiological insights,"Potassium dynamics are critical in the pathophysiology of sickle cell anemia (SCA), a genetic disorder characterized by the presence of abnormally shaped red blood cells that lead to various complications such as vaso-occlusive crises and hemolytic anemia. This review focuses on the clinical implications and pathophysiological insights of potassium regulation in SCA, highlighting its impact on disease progression and potential therapeutic strategies. The dysregulation of potassium transport in SCA leads to significant K+ efflux and cellular dehydration, exacerbating the sickling process. Dehydrated sickle cells, due to potassium loss, become more rigid and prone to causing blockages in small blood vessels, leading to painful vaso-occlusive crises and ischemia. Furthermore, chronic hemolysis in SCA, aggravated by potassium imbalance, contributes to severe anemia and systemic complications. These insights underscore the importance of maintaining potassium homeostasis to mitigate disease severity and improve patient outcomes. Therapeutic strategies targeting potassium regulation show promise in managing SCA. Inhibitors of the Gardos channel, such as senicapoc, have demonstrated potential in reducing sickling and hemolysis. Additionally, hydration therapy plays a crucial role in maintaining electrolyte balance and preventing RBC dehydration. A comprehensive approach that includes monitoring and correcting electrolyte imbalances, along with standard treatments like hydroxyurea and blood transfusions, is essential for effective disease management.","Sickle cell anemia (SCA) is a hereditary hemoglobinopathy resulting from a single nucleotide mutation in the β-globin gene, leading to the production of abnormal hemoglobin S (HbS). This genetic alteration causes red blood cells (RBCs) to adopt a sickle shape under hypoxic conditions, which impairs their function and lifespan. The distorted shape and reduced flexibility of sickle cells contribute to vaso-occlusive events, hemolysis, and chronic anemia, manifesting in severe clinical complications, and reduced life expectancy<sup><xref rid=""R1"" ref-type=""bibr"">1</xref>–<xref rid=""R3"" ref-type=""bibr"">3</xref></sup>. The pathophysiology of SCA is complex and multifactorial, involving a cascade of cellular and molecular events<sup><xref rid=""R4"" ref-type=""bibr"">4</xref></sup>. Central to this process is the polymerization of HbS, which occurs when deoxygenated, leading to the formation of rigid, sickle-shaped RBCs<sup><xref rid=""R5"" ref-type=""bibr"">5</xref></sup>. These cells obstruct blood flow in small vessels, causing ischemia and tissue damage. Hemolysis, both intravascular and extravascular, is another hallmark of SCA, resulting in chronic anemia and a range of associated symptoms, including fatigue, jaundice, and increased susceptibility to infections<sup><xref rid=""R6"" ref-type=""bibr"">6</xref>,<xref rid=""R7"" ref-type=""bibr"">7</xref></sup>. Potassium (K+) homeostasis is crucial for maintaining cellular function and integrity<sup><xref rid=""R8"" ref-type=""bibr"">8</xref></sup>. In RBCs, potassium balance is particularly important for regulating cell volume and preventing dehydration. Dysregulation of potassium transport mechanisms can lead to significant cellular dehydration, exacerbating the sickling process. The role of potassium in SCA, therefore, extends beyond simple electrolyte balance, influencing the severity and progression of the disease. Several key transport mechanisms regulate potassium levels in RBCs, including the K-Cl cotransporter, Gardos channel, and Na-K-ATPase pump<sup><xref rid=""R9"" ref-type=""bibr"">9</xref></sup>. The K-Cl cotransporter mediates the coupled movement of K+ and Cl- out of the cell, while the Gardos channel, a Ca2+-activated K+ channel, plays a critical role in K+ efflux during cellular dehydration. The Na-K-ATPase pump, meanwhile, actively maintains the gradient of Na+ and K+ across the cell membrane, essential for cellular homeostasis. In SCA, these potassium transport mechanisms often become dysregulated, leading to increased K+ efflux and cellular dehydration<sup><xref rid=""R10"" ref-type=""bibr"">10</xref></sup>. As water follows K+ out of the cell osmotically, sickle RBCs become more dehydrated, increasing intracellular HbS concentration and promoting further polymerization. Dehydrated sickle cells are more rigid and prone to adhere to the vascular endothelium, contributing to vaso-occlusive events and tissue ischemia. The clinical implications of potassium dysregulation in SCA are profound. Vaso-occlusive crises, a primary cause of morbidity and mortality in SCA, are closely linked to the dehydration and rigidity of sickle cells. Additionally, chronic hemolysis exacerbated by potassium imbalance leads to persistent anemia and systemic complications<sup><xref rid=""R11"" ref-type=""bibr"">11</xref></sup>. Vaso-occlusive crises are a defining feature of SCA, caused by the obstruction of small blood vessels by sickled RBCs. Potassium dynamics significantly influence these crises, as dehydrated and rigid RBCs are more likely to cause vascular blockages. This underscores the importance of maintaining potassium homeostasis to reduce the frequency and severity of vaso-occlusive events, thereby improving the quality of life for SCA patients<sup><xref rid=""R12"" ref-type=""bibr"">12</xref></sup>. Chronic hemolysis in SCA leads to anemia, contributing to symptoms such as fatigue, pallor, and jaundice. Potassium loss from RBCs exacerbates hemolysis by increasing cell fragility and promoting sickling. Therapeutic approaches that stabilize potassium levels within RBCs may help reduce hemolysis, thereby ameliorating anemia and its associated symptoms. This highlights the potential of targeted interventions in improving hemolytic outcomes in SCA<sup><xref rid=""R13"" ref-type=""bibr"">13</xref></sup>. Several therapeutic strategies aim to address potassium dysregulation in SCA. Gardos channel inhibitors, such as senicapoc, have shown promise in reducing RBC dehydration and sickling. Additionally, hydration therapy, which ensures adequate fluid intake and electrolyte balance, is crucial for preventing cellular dehydration and reducing vaso-occlusive crises. A holistic approach that includes these strategies, alongside standard treatments like hydroxyurea and blood transfusions, is essential for effective SCA management.     SCA is caused by a point mutation in the β-globin gene, leading to the production of abnormal hemoglobin S (HbS). Under conditions of low oxygen tension, HbS molecules polymerize, causing red blood cells (RBCs) to assume a sickle shape. This polymerization process is central to the pathogenesis of SCA, contributing to RBC rigidity, reduced deformability, and increased susceptibility to hemolysis. The review highlighted that polymerized HbS promotes RBC adhesion to vascular endothelium, initiating vaso-occlusion in small blood vessels. This process obstructs blood flow, leading to tissue ischemia and acute pain crises characteristic of SCA. Endothelial dysfunction, inflammatory mediators, and adhesive interactions between sickled RBCs and endothelial cells further exacerbate Vaso-Occlusive Crises (VOC), perpetuating tissue damage and organ dysfunction. Chronic hemolysis in SCA results from the fragility of sickled RBCs and their shortened lifespan. Released hemoglobin leads to scavenging of nitric oxide (NO), impairing vasodilation and promoting vasoconstriction. Dysregulation of ion transport systems, including increased potassium efflux via the Gardos channel (KCa3.1), contributes to RBC dehydration and further promotes sickling. The review highlighted that chronic inflammation in SCA is driven by activated leukocytes, endothelial activation, and the release of proinflammatory cytokines and adhesion molecules. This inflammatory milieu contributes to a prothrombotic state, endothelial dysfunction, and tissue injury, exacerbating the pathophysiology of the disease. Targeting the molecular pathways involved in HbS polymerization, such as modifying the balance of HbF production or developing agents that inhibit polymer formation, represents promising therapeutic strategies<sup><xref rid=""R40"" ref-type=""bibr"">40</xref></sup>. Additionally, interventions aimed at reducing chronic hemolysis, preserving RBC hydration, and mitigating inflammatory responses may alleviate symptoms and prevent complications in patients with SCA. Insights into the pathophysiological mechanisms of SCA inform clinical management strategies aimed at preventing vaso-occlusive crises, managing chronic pain, and reducing organ damage. Therapeutic approaches may include hydroxyurea to increase HbF levels, blood transfusions to dilute sickled cells, and novel agents targeting specific molecular pathways involved in RBC sickling and adhesion. Advances in gene therapy and gene editing technologies offer potential curative approaches by correcting the genetic defect responsible for SCA<sup><xref rid=""R41"" ref-type=""bibr"">41</xref></sup>. Ongoing research focuses on optimizing these therapies, addressing challenges such as delivery methods and long-term efficacy, to pave the way for personalized medicine in the treatment of SCA. The review highlights the importance of multidisciplinary care and comprehensive management strategies for individuals with SCA. This includes genetic counseling, early detection of complications through regular monitoring, and addressing psychosocial needs to improve overall patient outcomes and quality of life. The management of sickle cell anemia (SCA) is a multifaceted endeavor that encompasses a range of therapeutic strategies aimed at alleviating symptoms, preventing complications, and improving overall quality of life for individuals affected by this genetic disorder. Through a comprehensive approach that integrates disease-modifying therapies like hydroxyurea, supportive care measures such as pain management and hydration therapy, and proactive management of complications like vaso-occlusive crises and organ damage, healthcare providers can significantly enhance patient outcomes. The advent of novel therapies, including gene editing and gene therapy approaches, holds promise for potentially curing SCA by addressing the underlying genetic defect responsible for abnormal hemoglobin production. These advancements underscore ongoing efforts to transform the treatment landscape and offer hope for a future where individuals with SCA can live healthier lives, free from the burden of chronic pain and complications. Moreover, patient education and psychosocial support play pivotal roles in empowering individuals and families to manage SCA effectively. Educating patients about the disease, promoting adherence to treatment regimens, and providing emotional support are essential components of holistic care that promote self-management and improve overall well-being.

 AVN is a multifactorial condition characterized by disrupted blood and oxygen supply to the bone vasculature, leading to trabecular thinning and bone collapse. In SCD, infarction results from red blood cell (RBC) occlusion of the vasculature due to an altered RBC shape, hindering smooth blood flow and promoting vaso‐occlusion. This process can lead to bone marrow occlusion, ischemia, and eventual AVN development, with up to 50% of sickle cell patients experiencing AVN by 35 years of age.

 This case report highlights the increased risk of orthopedic complications in individuals with this condition. This case can provide valuable insights into the challenges of managing bone health in sickle cell patients, as well as the importance of early detection and intervention to prevent serious complications like AVN, emphasizing the challenges faced during treatment in a young African male. Understanding the expected pre‐ and postoperative course, as well as intraoperative considerations, is crucial for the optimal management of such patients. A 20‐year‐old male, known to have SCD since the age of 8 months, has been on regular follow‐up. The patient presented with severe left hip pain and an inability to bear weight following a simple fall from a standing height. Further history revealed a prolonged history of groin pain that was relieved by rest and analgesia but had been increasing in severity. Despite being informed of a stress fracture on the femoral neck tension side, the patient disregarded medical advice until it progressed to a complete fracture. Additionally, the patient had a history of a left subtrochanteric fracture 8 years prior, which was traditionally treated by a bone setter and resulted in malunion, shortening, external rotation, and a limping gait. All other systems were normal, and the patient had a good nutritional status and family history. Past medical history included multiple hospitalizations, blood transfusions, and the use of folic acid and hydroxyurea tablets. On examination, the patient appeared well but pale, was not jaundiced, and was vitally stable but in pain. Physical examination revealed external rotation of the left limb, with an apparent shortening of 4.5 cm. The Bryant's Triangle test was positive for below the greater trochanteric shortening of 4 cm. The distal neurovascular examination was intact, and the right lower limb and both upper limbs were normal. Laboratory tests showed a hemoglobin level of 7.2 g/dL, a total white blood cell count of 10,000 cm<sup>3</sup>, a platelet count of 230 × 10<sup>3</sup>/μL, a normal erythrocyte sedimentation rate, C‐reactive protein, renal function tests, and viral screening. An X‐ray of the left hip revealed a malunited subtrochanteric fracture with severe varus deformity, a neckshaft angle of 85°, a vertically oriented basotrochanteric fracture, and sclerotic fracture ends, indicative of mostly complete fractures on top of old tension‐side stress fractures, as shown in Figure <xref rid=""ccr39413-fig-0001"" ref-type=""fig"">1</xref>. After thorough discussion and counseling with the patient, surgical treatment in the form of a subtrochanteric osteotomy with fixation using a dynamic hip screw with or without an iliac crest bone graft was planned. The surgery was performed on a traction table under spinal anesthesia with imaging intensifier guidance. A lag screw was positioned centrally in the neck under C‐arm guidance, followed by subtrochanteric osteotomy and fixation with a side plate using five screws. The closure was done in layers with Vicryl sutures, and the skin was closed with clips. The patient had an uneventful recovery period with no postoperative complications. Postoperatively, immediate X‐rays showed satisfactory reduction and closure of the fracture gap, as shown in Figure <xref rid=""ccr39413-fig-0002"" ref-type=""fig"">2</xref>. The patient was kept non‐weight‐bearing for the first 2 weeks, after which the clips were removed, and gentle range of motion (ROM) exercises at the hip, knee, ankle, and toe were initiated with partial weight‐bearing using a Zimmer frame, gradually progressing to full weight‐bearing at 6 weeks. The rehabilitation protocol included ROM exercises initiated on the first postoperative day for the hip, knee, and ankle joints. Weight‐bearing activities began with toe‐touch weight bearing as tolerated using a Zimmer frame. The weight‐bearing status was gradually progressed to partial weight bearing at 3 weeks, postoperatively. Subsequently, full weight bearing was permitted once callus formation was observed on X‐ray imaging at 6 weeks post‐surgery. At the 4‐month follow‐up, the patient had a full range of motion at the hip, a well‐healed scar, and no lower limb length discrepancy. After 2 years of follow‐up, the patient remained well and satisfied with no complications noted on X‐ray imaging, as shown in Figures <xref rid=""ccr39413-fig-0003"" ref-type=""fig"">3</xref> and <xref rid=""ccr39413-fig-0004"" ref-type=""fig"">4</xref>. The presented case is exceptional due to the presence of a stress fracture with a sclerotic fracture end, complicated by subtrochanteric malunion and varus deformity, in a sickle cell patient not under follow‐up. Remarkably, healing occurred despite the presence of the sclerotic fracture end without the need for a bone graft. This unique case highlights the significance of employing a multidisciplinary approach, conducting comprehensive clinical evaluations, utilizing surgical expertise, and implementing customized rehabilitation strategies when managing femoral neck fractures in individuals with SCD. By acknowledging and addressing the specific challenges associated with hematologic disorders, healthcare professionals can enhance treatment outcomes, facilitate patient recovery, and mitigate the potential complications linked to orthopedic fractures in this particular patient demographic. Femoral neck stress fractures can be a complication of osteonecrosis of the femoral head in patients with sickle cell anemia.<xref rid=""ccr39413-bib-0014"" ref-type=""bibr"">

</xref> While femoral neck fractures often result from falls, they can also be linked to chronic stress rather than a single traumatic incident. Osteoporosis is a significant risk factor for these fractures.<xref rid=""ccr39413-bib-0017"" ref-type=""bibr"">
<sup>17</sup>
</xref> In our case, we believe that the insufficiency fracture of the femoral neck was a consequence of extensive involvement of the femoral head by AVN and associated osteoporosis in the femoral neck and bone marrow infarcts. The patient's history of SCD since early childhood, previous subtrochanteric fracture with malunion, and neglect of medical advice regarding the femoral neck stress fracture underscore the challenges in managing orthopedic conditions in individuals with chronic hemolytic disorders. Patient education and compliance play a crucial role in preventing complications and optimizing treatment outcomes. The clinical findings of external rotation, limb shortening, and positive tests for above‐knee and below‐greater trochanteric shortening highlight the importance of a thorough physical examination in assessing fracture deformities and limb abnormalities. Additionally, laboratory tests and imaging studies, including X‐rays revealing malunion and severe varus deformity, aid in characterizing the extent of the fracture and guiding treatment decisions. The decision to proceed with surgical treatment, specifically subtrochanteric osteotomy with fixation using a dynamic hip screw and potential iliac crest bone graft, reflects a comprehensive approach to addressing the complex nature of the femoral neck fracture. Surgical precision, aided by imaging intensifier guidance, is crucial in achieving optimal fracture reduction and stability. The emphasis on postoperative care, including non‐weight bearing status, gradual initiation of ROM exercises, and progressive weight‐bearing protocol, demonstrates the importance of guided rehabilitation in promoting healing and restoring function. Close monitoring and adherence to the prescribed rehabilitation regimen are essential for the patient's successful recovery. The patient's uneventful recovery period and satisfactory closure of the fracture gap on postoperative X‐rays indicate successful surgical intervention and postoperative management. Long‐term follow‐up and monitoring are necessary to evaluate the integrity of the fixation, assess bone healing, and detect any potential complications or recurrent fractures. Collaborative efforts among orthopedic surgeons, hematologists, and other healthcare providers are integral in managing orthopedic complications in sickle cell patients. Patient counseling, education, and shared decision‐making facilitate informed choices regarding treatment options and postoperative care, contributing to a comprehensive and patient‐centered approach. Sickle cell anemia patients need information about risk for femoral neck stress fractures and the importance of seeking medical help if they have any pain or discomfort in their hip or groin. Physicians should be alert to the possibility of sickle cell anemia causing femoral neck stress fractures, especially active patients with a history of bone pain. Early detection and treatment is critical to avoid complications such as AVN and THR surgery. Aggressive non‐surgical measures including rest, analgesics, and physiotherapy are usually quite effective in managing femoral neck fractures among SCA clients. In some instances however, surgical intervention maybe necessary when the fracture is displaced or fails to heal using conservative treatment. Other recommendations include conducting a larger study to determine the occurrence, risk factors, and consequences of femoral neck tension breaks in sickle cell anemia patients also comparing the efficacy of diverse treatment options for femoral neck tension breaks in sickle cell anemia patients and investigating the role of bone marrow transplantation in preventing femoral neck stress fractures in sickle cell anemia patients. The findings in this article may not apply to all people who have sickle cell anemia with femoral neck stress fractures since it is based on one case report from a single patient. The patient in this case report was treated at a single center in Sudan hence the findings may not be generalizable to other centers or any other country.

"Sickle Cell Anemia Screening in Newborns and Analysis of Haplotypes in Patients from Santiago Island, Cape Verde","Sickle cell anemia (SCA) results from a mutation in the <italic toggle=""yes"">β</italic>-globin gene, leading to the production of mutant hemoglobin, known as hemoglobin S (HbS). Despite being a genetic disorder, the phenotype of SCA can be influenced by the level of fetal hemoglobin (HbF), which is associated with beta S-globin haplotypes. In this study, we conducted newborn screening (NBS) using samples collected from umbilical cord blood in two hospitals on Santiago Island, Cape Verde. In newborns, HbS was detected using high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) on dried blood spot, with confirmation through polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP). In addition, we assessed the hematological and clinical characteristics of a second population group consisting of patients diagnosed with SCA. Haplotype determination was performed on both newborns with HbS and patients with SCA. Beta S-globin haplotypes were determined using PCR-RFLP. Hematological values were analyzed using standard methods. Out of 346 newborns, 21 (6%) were carriers of the sickle cell trait (HbAS) while none were identified as homozygous for sickle cell disease (HbSS). Among both groups of individuals, four haplotypes were identified: Senegal, Arabi-Indian, Bantu, and Benin. The Senegal haplotype was the most prevalent, possibly reflecting the ethnic origin of the mutations observed. Hematological values did not differ significantly among haplotypes. However, higher levels of HbF were associated with better hematological values. These findings suggest a positive impact of elevated HbF levels on reducing the severity of SCA. Finally, we demonstrated how the combination of technics, HPLC and molecular analysis, provided a consistent and reproducible results that can be used for NBS for SCA.","Sickle cell anemia (SCA) is a type of hemoglobinopathy and one of the most common severe monogenic disorders in the world [<xref rid=""B1"" ref-type=""bibr"">1</xref>]. Specifically, SCA is a genetic disorder resulting from the substitution of adenine by thymine, which leads to the substitution of glutamic acid for valine at position 6 in the beta-globin molecule. This mutation gives rise to hemoglobin S (HbS) instead of normal adult hemoglobin (HbA). The inheritance of HbS can be heterozygous (HbAS), known as the sickle cell trait, or homozygous (HbSS), which results in SCA [<xref rid=""B2"" ref-type=""bibr"">2</xref>, <xref rid=""B3"" ref-type=""bibr"">3</xref>]. With different solubility and upon deoxygenation, HbS forms large polymers that affect the shape and function of erythrocytes, causing them to become sickle cells (SCs) [<xref rid=""B4"" ref-type=""bibr"">4</xref>]. These sickle cells have a short lifespan and are easily destroyed by hemolysis, leading to hemolytic anemia. In addition, these deformed red blood cells are prone to adhere to vessels, causing vaso-occlusion phenomena. This disease leads to several complications such as pain crises, leg ulcers, infections, priapism, splenic infarction, or even stroke [<xref rid=""B5"" ref-type=""bibr"">5</xref>, <xref rid=""B6"" ref-type=""bibr"">6</xref>]. Most countries in the Sub-Saharan Africa region do not have newborn screening programs for SCA [<xref rid=""B7"" ref-type=""bibr"">7</xref>, <xref rid=""B8"" ref-type=""bibr"">8</xref>]. Cape Verde is no exception to this reality. Located in the Sub-Saharan Africa region, Cape Verde has around 570,000 inhabitants and a birth rate of 10,544 live births per year. These islands were discovered uninhabited by the Portuguese in 1460 [<xref rid=""B9"" ref-type=""bibr"">9</xref>]. The settlement process of Cape Verde began around 1462 with African and European people involved in the Atlantic slave trade. This process resulted in a highly mixed population, with the potential for a great diversity of hemoglobinopathy alleles within the population [<xref rid=""B10"" ref-type=""bibr"">10</xref>, <xref rid=""B11"" ref-type=""bibr"">11</xref>]. Preliminary studies suggest that the allelic frequency of HbS in Santiago Island is 5% [<xref rid=""B12"" ref-type=""bibr"">12</xref>]. Usually, the first symptoms of SCA begin after 6 months of age, coinciding with the hemoglobin (Hb) transition from HbF to HbA, or in this case, specifically, the switch is from HbF to HbS [<xref rid=""B13"" ref-type=""bibr"">13</xref>]. Early diagnosis of SCA has a significant impact on patients' lives as it allows timely treatment, such as the administration of prophylactic penicillin and vaccination, reducing mortality in children under 5 years old. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), approximately 7% of the world's population carries hemoglobin disorders, and between 300,000 and 500,000, infants are born each year with the severe homozygous form [<xref rid=""B14"" ref-type=""bibr"">14</xref>]. Among these, more than 200,000 are Africans with sickle cell disease (SCD), accounting for 5% of overall mortality in children under 5 years old on this continent [<xref rid=""B14"" ref-type=""bibr"">14</xref>]. The sub-Saharan Africa region is considered an epicenter of SCA, with more than 75% of babies born with SCD worldwide each year [<xref rid=""B15"" ref-type=""bibr"">15</xref>, <xref rid=""B16"" ref-type=""bibr"">16</xref>]. Furthermore, in Cape Verde, around 4,030 blood transfusions are performed annually in national hospital services. Individuals with SCA may constitute a target group for these transfusions, as they are considered within the treatment of these patients in crisis [<xref rid=""B17"" ref-type=""bibr"">17</xref>, <xref rid=""B18"" ref-type=""bibr"">18</xref>]. However, even taking into account all these circumstances, in Cape Verde, there is no newborn screening program for SCA or well-designed diagnostic system for this disease. Nevertheless, although SCA is a genetic disease, the severity of complications can be modulated by factors such as fetal hemoglobin (HbF) levels, which are related to beta S-globin haplotypes. Haplotypes are defined by polymorphic DNA sequences in the <italic toggle=""yes"">β</italic>-globin gene cluster [<xref rid=""B19"" ref-type=""bibr"">19</xref>–<xref rid=""B21"" ref-type=""bibr"">21</xref>]. There are five common haplotypes associated with SCA, named according to the geographic areas where they predominate: Senegal (SEN), Benin (BEN), Bantu (BAT) (or Central Africa Republic, CAR), Cameroon (CA), and Arabic-India (AI) [<xref rid=""B22"" ref-type=""bibr"">22</xref>, <xref rid=""B23"" ref-type=""bibr"">23</xref>]. Arabic-Indian and Senegal haplotypes are associated with higher Hb levels, nearly 20% and 10%, respectively, contributing to a milder disease. Meanwhile, the Bantu haplotypes exhibit a more severe clinical phenotype, primarily attributed to lower levels of HbF, approximately 5% [<xref rid=""B19"" ref-type=""bibr"">19</xref>, <xref rid=""B24"" ref-type=""bibr"">24</xref>]. The classification of patients' haplotypes provides prognostic information, and also, it helps better understand the genetic variability associated with the disease and its distribution in different populations [<xref rid=""B19"" ref-type=""bibr"">19</xref>–<xref rid=""B21"" ref-type=""bibr"">21</xref>]. The aims of our study were to determine the prevalence of HbS in the Santiago Island population and analyze the association between haplotypes and clinical phenotypes of sickle cell patients.  Using the HPLC technique, the presence of HbS was detected in 21 newborns (6%). Through ARMS-PCR, positive and negative samples for HbS by HPLC exhibited amplification with the normal primer for <italic toggle=""yes"">ß</italic>-globin, SN1 (<xref rid=""fig1"" ref-type=""fig"">Figure 1(a)</xref>). Conversely, only positive samples for HbS demonstrated amplification with the mutant primer for <italic toggle=""yes"">ß</italic>-globin, SMUT1 (<xref rid=""fig1"" ref-type=""fig"">Figure 1(b)</xref>). This indicates that all these infants are heterozygous for SCA. All positive samples for HbS detected by HPLC revealed two bands on the gel, measuring 110 bp and 54–56 bp, upon digestion by the DdeI enzyme (<xref rid=""fig2"" ref-type=""fig"">Figure 2</xref>), indicating that they are heterozygotes. Infants with a normal hemoglobin profile (HbAA) exhibited a single band on the electrophoresis gel, measuring 54–56 bp. Out of 21 newborns with sickle cell trait, it was possible to determine the haplotypes in only 15 individuals. Among these newborns, four haplotypes were distinguished: Senegal (66.6%, 10), Arabi-Indian (20%, 3), Bantu (6.7%, 1), and Benin (6.7%, 1). Among 33 SCA patients, it was possible to determine the haplotypes in 31 individuals. In this group, most haplotypes occurred in compound heterozygosis. The Senegal/Benin haplotype was the most prevalent at 43.4% (14). Homozygous haplotypes were found for Senegal at 30.1% (10) and Benin at 6% (2). Neither Cameroon nor Arabi-Indian haplotypes were found in this group. The median or mean of age, sex, hematological values, and selected clinical information for different haplotypes among SCA patients are presented in <xref rid=""tab2"" ref-type=""table"">Table 2</xref>. Although no statistically significant differences were found among the different haplotype groups for the analyzed parameter, we could highlight that all the cases studied present HbF values higher than 4% (<xref rid=""tab2"" ref-type=""table"">Table 2</xref>). Through multiple and simple linear regression analyses between HbF and hematological values, a significant statistical association was observed with Hb, mean concentration of hemoglobin (MCH), red cell distribution width (RDW), and white blood cells (WBCs) (<xref rid=""tab3"" ref-type=""table"">Table 3</xref>). Higher levels of HbF were associated with increased levels of Hb in multiple linear regression analyses adjusted for sex and age. MCH exhibited a positive association with HbF levels in both, multiple and simple linear regression analyses. Conversely, RDW and WBC showed a negative association with HbF in both, multiple and simple linear regression analyses (<xref rid=""tab3"" ref-type=""table"">Table 3</xref> and Supplementary Tables <xref rid=""supplementary-material-1"" ref-type=""sec"">2</xref>, <xref rid=""supplementary-material-1"" ref-type=""sec"">4</xref>, <xref rid=""supplementary-material-1"" ref-type=""sec"">5</xref>, and <xref rid=""supplementary-material-1"" ref-type=""sec"">7</xref>). In other words, higher levels of HbF are associated with significant reduction of RDW and WBC. Logistic regression analysis revealed no significant relation between HbF and leg ulcers (<xref rid=""tab4"" ref-type=""table"">Table 4</xref> and Supplementary <xref rid=""supplementary-material-1"" ref-type=""sec"">Table 10</xref>). High-income countries that implemented newborn screening (NBS) programs for SCA showed an effective way to reduce hospitalizations and complications in children with SCA [<xref rid=""B32"" ref-type=""bibr"">32</xref>]. However, the NBS program for SCA is still a challenging step to achieve in many developing countries. In this study, the diagnosis age of SCA of patients was elevated and the mean was around 10 years old. This result may reflect the lack of an NBS program for SCA in Cape Verde, and a similar result was verified in another study in Brazil [<xref rid=""B33"" ref-type=""bibr"">33</xref>]. In this newborn screening, from the 346 samples analyzed, 6% had sickle cell trait. This result is similar to another previous study carried out in the Santiago Island [<xref rid=""B17"" ref-type=""bibr"">17</xref>]. Worldwide, the prevalence of SCA differs between regions. A study made by Peil et al. (2013) predicted allele frequency higher than 15% in regions of Angola, Nigeria, and Gabon. Other countries such as Democratic Republic of Congo, Senegal, India, Saudi Arabia, and Madagascar presented allele frequency between 7.5% and 12.5% [<xref rid=""B34"" ref-type=""bibr"">34</xref>]. The result found in Cape Verde is similar with some regions in Brazil. This similarity may be the outcome of the settlement process, marked by slavery trade in Africa by European people, which resulted in highly miscegenated people in both countries [<xref rid=""B10"" ref-type=""bibr"">10</xref>, <xref rid=""B11"" ref-type=""bibr"">11</xref>, <xref rid=""B35"" ref-type=""bibr"">35</xref>]. The identification of sickle cell trait has important clinical significance. Although they are generally asymptomatic people when exposed to certain conditions, such as extreme temperatures, dehydration, and intense exercise, individuals with sickle cell trait can develop complications [<xref rid=""B36"" ref-type=""bibr"">36</xref>]. In genetic counseling, premarital diagnosis plays an important role in avoiding at-risk couples [<xref rid=""B37"" ref-type=""bibr"">37</xref>]. Beta S-globin haplotype determination is useful for prognostic purposes, as it helps predict the HbF level and study the genetic origin of the HbS gene in the population [<xref rid=""B19"" ref-type=""bibr"">19</xref>–<xref rid=""B21"" ref-type=""bibr"">21</xref>]. In this study, haplotype determination included both sickle cell trait and SCA patients. Among newborns, only sickle cell trait was found, with four determined haplotypes: Senegal (66.6%), Arabi-Indian (20%), Benin (6.7%), and Bantu (6.7%). In SCA patients, three haplotypes were found, occurring in homozygosis: Senegal/Senegal (30.1%) and Benin/Benin (6%), and in heterozygosis: Senegal/Benin (43.4%) and Senegal/Bantu (15.5%). This diversity and frequency of haplotypes in the population may be a reflection of the settlement process in Cape Verde [<xref rid=""B10"" ref-type=""bibr"">10</xref>, <xref rid=""B11"" ref-type=""bibr"">11</xref>]. The colonization process of Cape Verde began on the island of Santiago, with Africans and Europeans. The settlers were mainly black Africans, captured as slaves on the coast of Guinea, a region that included, in addition to Cape Verde, Gambia, Senegal, Guinea-Bissau, Guinea, Sierra Leone, and Liberia [<xref rid=""B38"" ref-type=""bibr"">38</xref>–<xref rid=""B40"" ref-type=""bibr"">40</xref>]. This fact is supported by the study carried out by Beleza et al. (2012), where they found that more than 57% of Santiago's ancestry came from people from West Africa [<xref rid=""B11"" ref-type=""bibr"">11</xref>]. This evidence may explain the predominance of Senegal haplotypes, followed by the Benin haplotype, found in this study [<xref rid=""B41"" ref-type=""bibr"">41</xref>]. Among the Europeans, the inhabitants were mainly Portuguese, as were the colonizers, Spanish and Italian. The Sephardic Jewish people of North Africa were another group of people who migrated to Cape Verde, especially for economic reasons [<xref rid=""B11"" ref-type=""bibr"">11</xref>, <xref rid=""B38"" ref-type=""bibr"">38</xref>, <xref rid=""B42"" ref-type=""bibr"">42</xref>]. The presence of Jews in Cape Verde may explain the frequency of the Arabi-Indian haplotypes found in this study. The Bantu haplotype showed less representation, which may reflect less influence from people from other African regions during settlement in Cape Verde [<xref rid=""B11"" ref-type=""bibr"">11</xref>, <xref rid=""B41"" ref-type=""bibr"">41</xref>]. Regarding the hematological values found in the patients in this study, the results are in line with those described in the literature for patients with SCA. Low erythrocyte and Hb values result from the hemolytic nature of SCA, which is not accompanied by the same replacement rate [<xref rid=""B43"" ref-type=""bibr"">43</xref>, <xref rid=""B44"" ref-type=""bibr"">44</xref>]. The median leukocyte count was high, reflecting the inflammatory status of SCA. Regarding HbF levels, elevated values were found in most patients, with a median around 11.1%, which is a common characteristic of SCA patients. Although different classes of haplotypes are associated with clinical phenotypes of SCA patients, no statistically significant association with hematological values or HbF level was verified in this study. Regarding hematological values, similar results were found in previous studies conducted in India and Brazil [<xref rid=""B45"" ref-type=""bibr"">45</xref>]. These results may be due to the limited number of samples in this study, which may reduce the statistical power of the data [<xref rid=""B46"" ref-type=""bibr"">46</xref>]. Regrettably, for the present study, the sample size could not be increased further due to resource constraints. However, regarding the relationship between HbF levels and hematological values, a significant association was verified with Hb, RDW, HCM, and WBC. Patients with high levels of HbF had higher levels of Hb and HCM and reduced levels of RDW, reflecting the reduction in the degree of hemolysis due to the antipolymerization effect of HbF in SCA [<xref rid=""B47"" ref-type=""bibr"">47</xref>]. The reduction of the RDW value may reflect the decrease in reticulocytes in the bloodstream as a result of reduced hemolysis, which underlies the pathophysiology of this disease [<xref rid=""B47"" ref-type=""bibr"">47</xref>]. The significant association between higher HbF and decreased leukocyte counts indicates an improvement in the inflammatory state of SCA, which plays an important role in the clinical complications of this disease [<xref rid=""B48"" ref-type=""bibr"">48</xref>]. Finally, although a significant association between HbF and leg ulcer was not verified, the positive impact on hematological values supports the fact that HbF is the main modulator of SCA, reducing the severity of the disease [<xref rid=""B49"" ref-type=""bibr"">49</xref>, <xref rid=""B50"" ref-type=""bibr"">50</xref>]. Our study demonstrates the feasibility of implementing a neonatal screening program for early diagnosis of SCA in Cape Verde. The 6% prevalence of sickle cell trait and the late age of diagnosis of SCA patients found in this study indicate that NBS should be a priority in Cape Verde. The haplotype diversity and predominance of haplotypes from Senegal followed by Benin may reflect the settlement process in Cape Verde, with people brought as slaves from the coastal region of West Africa. Hematological values and HbF did not differ between haplotypes nor did the HbF level. However, HbF contributes to alleviate the severity of SCA, by reducing the degree of hemolysis and inflammation. Together, these parameters can be considered useful information to promote personalized medicine for patients with SCA.",N/A,2024
Impaired phagocytosis and oxidative respiratory burst activity in sickle cell anemia leukocytes,,"Sickle cell disease (SCD) is one of the most prominent genetic diseases worldwide, with a very high prevalence in the Middle East, Mediterranean regions, Southeast Asia, and sub-Saharan Africa. It is characterized by the inheritance of two abnormal hemoglobin (Hb) genes, with one being responsible for the sickle Hb (Hb-S) production. SCD comprises the homozygote Hb-S and compound heterozygotes Hb-S including Hb-SC, SD, SO-Arab, and Sβ-thal. People who inherit one sickle mutation (Hb-S) have the sickle cell trait (Hb AS), an otherwise largely benign condition that confers some protection against severe malaria, which is the reason SCD is more prevalent in parts of the world where malaria is endemic.<xref rid=""bib1"" ref-type=""bibr""><sup>1</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid=""bib2"" ref-type=""bibr""><sup>2</sup></xref> More than three-quarters of the more than 500,000 annual births with SCD are found in sub-Saharan Africa, especially Equatorial Guinea, Benin, Burkina Faso, Nigeria, Sierra Leone, and Togo. Sickle cell anemia (SCA) is the most common and severe form of SCD, with about 50–90% of affected individuals experiencing acute vaso-occlusive crises and a reduced life expectancy of about 30 years compared to the general population.<xref rid=""bib3"" ref-type=""bibr""><sup>3</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid=""bib4"" ref-type=""bibr""><sup>4</sup></xref> SCA is associated with significant morbidity and mortality due to its unique abnormal red blood cell (RBC) morphology. It causes recurrent vaso-occlusive events, chronic hemolysis, endothelial dysfunction, long-term complications such as avascular necrosis, and impaired leukocyte functions, significantly compromising the immune system and leading to high susceptibility to invasive bacterial infections and severe malaria complications. The frequent predisposition of SCA patients to severe infections is one of the major precipitants of the sickle cell crisis, and the leading cause of morbidity and overall mortality among SCA patients, especially in developing countries.<xref rid=""bib5"" ref-type=""bibr""><sup>5</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid=""bib6"" ref-type=""bibr""><sup>6</sup></xref> While much attention has been given to the pathophysiology of RBC abnormalities in SCA, there is a dearth of knowledge on the role of leukocyte dysfunction in the disease phenotype.

This is consistent with previous findings reporting depressed leukocyte oxidative respiratory burst activity in SCA children and adults.<xref rid=""bib25"" ref-type=""bibr""><sup>25</sup></xref> The susceptibility to infection and impairment of neutrophil oxidative burst activity in SCA is thought to result from hemolysis-derived heme, which causes the induction of heme oxygenase-1 during granulopoiesis, subsequently resulting in the production of neutrophils with reduced oxidative burst capacity.<xref rid=""bib9"" ref-type=""bibr""><sup>9</sup></xref> There was, however, no difference in the chemotactic activity of all groups. A critical step in bacterial destruction and inflammation is leukocyte extravasation, involving the modulation of adhesion molecules expression on both leukocytes and their counterparts on endothelial cells. The proinflammatory mediator-induced shedding of L-selectin (cluster of differentiation 62 ligand [CD62L]) and elevated CD11b/CD18 expression by the leukocytes are particularly major events in transendothelial migration. L-selectin is an adhesion molecule expressed on the surface of leukocytes, facilitating their adherence to the endothelium and subsequent migration to sites of infection or inflammation.<xref rid=""bib26"" ref-type=""bibr""><sup>26</sup></xref> Hb-SS steady and Hb-SS undergoing medication groups had lower L-selectin levels than the other groups. A decrease in L-selectin levels has been implicated in the shedding process that occurs during neutrophil activation, which can reduce neutrophil's marginal pool and contribute to hyperleukocytosis in the SCA patients.<xref rid=""bib27"" ref-type=""bibr""><sup>27</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid=""bib28"" ref-type=""bibr""><sup>28</sup></xref> These impairments may immobilize polymorphonuclear cells on the endothelium, reducing blood flow and promoting microvascular occlusion and vascular damage. Decreased L-selectin levels may also indicate sequestration by binding to activated endothelium.<xref rid=""bib26"" ref-type=""bibr""><sup>26</sup></xref> IL-8 has been used as a functional marker of leukocyte chemotaxis and adhesion, especially in the early catabolic phase.<xref rid=""bib29"" ref-type=""bibr""><sup>29</sup></xref> Elevated IL-8 levels observed in the SCA groups could suggest increased leukocyte chemotaxis and adhesion to the vascular endothelium, and confirm its significant contribution, not only to pathogenesis but also to the chronic inflammatory state in SCA. Leukocyte count and leukocyte viability were negatively correlated with phagocytic activity in the SCA vaso-occlusive crisis group. In SCA, leukocytosis is usually accompanied by increased susceptibility to infection-mediated acute crises, as evident in the SCA crisis group described above.<xref rid=""bib20"" ref-type=""bibr""><sup>20</sup></xref> The negative association of leukocytosis and leukocyte viability with phagocytosis in the SCA crisis patients indicates that prevalent leukocytosis did not improve their phagocytic activity. This agrees with previous reports on the effect of leukocyte count on some leukocyte functions.<xref rid=""bib23"" ref-type=""bibr""><sup>23</sup></xref> There was, however, no correlation between the leukocyte viability, chemotactic activity; and oxidative respiratory burst activity of the SCA groups, indicating an inappropriate polymorphonuclear cell response. Leukocyte functions can be incorporated as a prognostic tool for identifying patients at higher risk of complications and can facilitate personalized management approaches of SCA patients. Incorporating leukocyte function assays into routine clinical care can also enhance diagnostic accuracy and guide treatment decisions. This can lead to more effective strategies for preventing infections and managing complications in SCA patients, ultimately improving their quality of life and prognosis. Leukocyte ratios correlate with mortality in the general population and clinical outcomes when elevated in several specific subsets of diseases and chronic disorders including sepsis, pneumonia, COVID-19, and cancer.<xref rid=""bib30"" ref-type=""bibr""><sup>30</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid=""bib31"" ref-type=""bibr""><sup>31</sup></xref> There is a keen interest in using leukocyte ratios to evaluate inflammatory status in SCA, given their relative stability against various physiological, pathological, and physical influences. The leukocyte ratios were all increased in the SCA groups, buttressing the contributions of neutrophils, monocytes, lymphocytes, and platelets in the constitutive inflammatory process of SCA.<xref rid=""bib32"" ref-type=""bibr""><sup>32</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid=""bib33"" ref-type=""bibr""><sup>33</sup></xref> However, the MLR in this study showed more sensitivity in indicating the ongoing inflammatory process across SCA groups than the other ratios. This correlates with other reports on elevated leukocyte ratios in the SCA patients.<xref rid=""bib34"" ref-type=""bibr""><sup>34</sup></xref> These ratios can thus be used as cost-efficient, stable, and readily available surrogate markers of inflammation. They are a promising marker in the risk stratification of SCA patients and complement established biomarkers in their diagnosis and treatment. Combination treatment with medications and blood transfusion significantly reduced the NLR and PLR of the SCA patients compared to the other SCA groups, suggesting that combination therapy reverses some of the chronic inflammation associated with SCA patients. This study had certain limitations. Some of our leukocyte function assays may provide limited characterization of the leukocyte subsets, and reduced sensitivity in detecting subtle changes in leukocyte function relative to other sophisticated methods for assessing leukocyte function. Another limitation is that leukocyte ratios as surrogate markers of inflammation may not capture the complex and multifaceted nature of the immune response as well as immune dysregulation. Also, the study had a relatively small sample size with limited age group, which may limit the generalizability of our findings. The results of this study suggest that altered modulation of inflammatory markers and leukocyte adhesion molecule could influence leukocyte migration, causing inappropriate leukocytes activation and tissue injury. Reduced leukocyte phagocytic and oxidative respiratory burst activities constitute altered leukocyte function, and may be culpable for the increased susceptibility to infections in SCA and the risk of mortality, especially during the crisis state. Thus, emphasizing their usefulness in predicting poor outcomes in SCA. The leukocyte function in SCA may be improved via promoting anti-inflammatory pathways to mitigate chronic inflammation associated with SCD, which may enhance their phagocytic function. Optimizing the redox balance within leukocytes or modulating oxidative stress pathways could also enhance the oxidative respiratory burst activity of the SCA leukocytes. Future studies investigating the underlying molecular and cellular pathways driving the functional alterations in SCA leukocyte could provide deeper insights into the pathophysiology of their associated immune dysfunction, and help identify novel therapeutic targets and interventions to mitigate their increased infection risk.

Hydroxyurea mobile directly observed therapy versus standard monitoring in patients with sickle cell anemia: a phase 2 randomized trial," Sickle cell anemia (SCA) is an inherited blood disorder in which there is an abnormal protein inside red blood cells. This results in red blood cells becoming sickle shaped and more easily destroyed in the body. Long-term treatment with hydroxyurea can reduce the frequency of illness and hospitalization. However, often people do not manage to take their medication regularly when treatment is long-term. We therefore investigated whether people with SCA in sub-Saharan Africa are more likely to take hydroxyurea when they are remotely monitored than when they are not. Remote monitoring did not improve adherence. However, our study is small and was undertaken over a short time period when hydroxyurea had only recently become available to people with SCA. We propose further studies, to see if remote monitoring increases medication adherence in people with SCA in other scenarios. Sasi et al. evaluate whether using a smartphone to record drug treatment improves monitoring of adherence to medication and improved treatment outcome. In a pilot study of sickle cell anemia in patients starting long-term treatment with hydroxyurea, adherence was not increased when mobile Directly Observed Therapy (m-DOT) was used.","The global health burden of hemoglobinopathies, including sickle cell anemia (SCA), is comparable to that of infectious and other major diseases<sup><xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR1"">1</xref>,<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR2"">2</xref></sup>. Every year, about 300,000 children are born with SCA in the world, 75% of whom are born in sub-Saharan Africa<sup><xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR3"">3</xref></sup>. In Tanzania, between 8000 and 11,000 children are born with SCA annually, one of the highest annual SCA birth rates in the world<sup><xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR4"">4</xref></sup>. Such high birth rates imply that a significant number of people in Tanzania and the rest of sub-Saharan Africa suffer the negative impact of this chronic, debilitating disease on their physical and mental health throughout their lifespan, with the majority of them not surviving to adulthood<sup><xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR5"">5</xref></sup>. Although survival for children with SCA in the US has improved during the last 30 years<sup><xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR6"">6</xref></sup>, SCA mortality still contributes up to 16% of under-five mortality in Africa<sup><xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR7"">7</xref></sup>. However, significant reductions in mortality and high survival rates have been reported where early diagnosis and comprehensive treatment have been implemented<sup><xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR8"">8</xref>,<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR9"">9</xref></sup>. Comprehensive treatments include prophylaxis for infectious complications, long-term use of disease-modifying medications such as hydroxyurea (HU) or L-glutamine, and chronic blood transfusion programs. Curative therapies for SCA such as hematopoietic stem cell transplantation and gene therapy are still not well established and/or remain unaffordable for patients in low-and mid-income countries. HU has been demonstrated in placebo-controlled multi-center clinical trials to be efficacious in reducing complications such as vaso-occlusive pain crises and acute chest syndrome in children and adults with SCA and in improving survival in adults<sup><xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR10"">10</xref>,<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR11"">11</xref></sup>. While there has been strong evidence for the benefit of HU therapy in adults with SCA for many years<sup><xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR12"">12</xref></sup>, more recent safety and efficacy data support the use of this therapy even in very young children<sup><xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR11"">11</xref></sup>. In addition, patients who are adherent to treatment have reduced healthcare utilization<sup><xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR13"">13</xref>–<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR16"">16</xref></sup>. The drug is given in a single daily dose and is very well tolerated<sup><xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR11"">11</xref></sup>. A recent multi-center study in sub-Saharan Africa has shown that long-term HU use may be feasible, safe and effective in patients with SCA. In that study, HU reduced the incidence of vaso-occlusive events, infections, malaria, blood transfusions, and death<sup><xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR17"">17</xref></sup>. These data highlight the need for wider access to treatment with HU for patients with SCA. Experience from the US, where HU is widely available and has been in use for SCA for decades shows that poor adherence is one of the major barriers to effective HU treatment in SCA. Overall adherence to HU as low as mean medication possession ratio (MPR) of 60% among patients with SCA<sup><xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR18"">18</xref></sup> and overall adherence to daily medications (mean MPR) of 58.4% among children with SCA<sup><xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR19"">19</xref></sup> have been reported. HU for SCA is a long-term treatment, it is a costly medication in certain low income settings and is not widely available in many African countries. In recent years, however, through National Health Insurance schemes, HU treatment has become part of the standard of care for SCA in some sub-Saharan African countries. Published trials in Africa so far show high adherence scores<sup><xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR20"">20</xref>,<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR21"">21</xref></sup> suggesting that adherence to HU treatment among SCA patients is not a problem in sub-Saharan Africa at the moment. In real life, however, adherence to drug treatment is dynamic and may change over time. A parallel can be drawn with adherence to other medications for chronic non-communicable diseases such as hypertension<sup><xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR22"">22</xref></sup> and type 2 diabetes mellitus<sup><xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR23"">23</xref></sup>, which remains consistently low. The causes of lack of adherence may be provider-related, patient-related, or system-related. Patient-related barriers to adherence include time and transportation to a clinic and to a pharmacy to obtain refills<sup><xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR15"">15</xref></sup>. Over 20% of families refuse HU treatment because of reasons such as fear of cancer or other side effects, concern about lack of efficacy and unwillingness to take the medicine or attend clinic or go to pharmacy<sup><xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR24"">24</xref>,<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR25"">25</xref></sup>. Family-reported barriers include difficulty in obtaining refills from the pharmacy and coming to the clinic for follow-up<sup><xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR15"">15</xref></sup>, fear of cancer and other side effects, not wanting to have required laboratory monitoring, or not thinking the medication would work. Potential barriers to adherence in sub-Saharan Africa have not yet been investigated, but access to care is anticipated to be a major problem given the challenges with transportation to SCA centers for patients who live in rural areas and the limited number of SCA providers. Approaches that seek to address the determinants of adherence such as DOT have demonstrated improvement in adherence and patient-centered outcomes in other diseases<sup><xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR26"">26</xref></sup>. DOT has been shown to improve adherence in multiple clinical trials in tuberculosis and HIV-AIDS<sup><xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR27"">27</xref>–<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR29"">29</xref></sup>. DOT is more than supervised pill swallowing; it is also a means to provide support and education. Electronic medication adherence monitoring systems or digital adherence technologies such as medication event monitoring system (MEMS caps) have been evaluated extensively in clinical trials for improving medication adherence<sup><xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR28"">28</xref></sup>. These systems can provide useful information on adherence on a long-term basis, however, they are proprietary, relatively expensive, cumbersome to carry and may need to be duplicated for each medication taken by the patient. A study conducted by Creary et al.<sup><xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR30"">30</xref></sup> in 15 individuals aged 1–22 years in an urban setting in the US demonstrated that mobile-DOT (m-DOT), where the patient records a video of herself in the act of ingesting the HU pill(s) and sends it to the study team, is feasible, acceptable and can achieve high HU adherence. Median MPR before intervention (0.75) improved to 0.91 and the overall median HU adherence with electronic DOT was 93.3%. Since adherence barriers can vary by age, further studies in other age groups and different geographical settings might expand our knowledge of the impact of m-DOT on HU adherence. We conducted a randomized controlled trial to eventuate the impact of m-DOT on adherence to HU treatment in adult HbSS patients in Tanzania to see whether the use of this innovative patient care tool is associated with increased adherence.

"Assessment of Burden on Family Caregivers of Children With Sickle Cell Anemia in Al Madinah Al Munawwarah, Saudi Arabia","Background Sickle cell anemia (SCA) results in various complications, necessitating continuous daily care and placing burdens on caregivers. Objectives This study aims to assess the burden on family caregivers of children with SCA and its associated factors. Materials and methods This analytical cross-sectional study was conducted in Madinah City, Saudi Arabia. We included family caregivers of children with SCA who were registered and treated at the Maternity and Child Hospital in King Salman Medical City. Data were collected from all registered files of children who received treatment for SCA. Data from participants was obtained using the validated Arabic version of the Zarit Burden Interview (ZBI). Descriptive statistics, chi-square tests, independent sample t-tests, and multivariate regression analysis were used in the statistical analysis. Results Overall, 124 caregivers participated out of 166 (response rate: 74.7%), among which 83 (66.9%) were fathers, 72 (58.1%) were aged ≥40 years, 96 (77.4%) held Saudi nationality, and 62 (50%) had a monthly income of <5000 SAR. The average daily caregiving hours were 5±4 hours, and 30 (24.2%) of children were diagnosed with associated physical or psychological diseases. The Zarit Burden Interview score indicated that 45 (36.3%) of caregivers reported no burden, whereas 51 (41.1%), 22 (17.7%), and 6 (4.8%) reported mild, moderate, and severe burden, respectively. Factors contributing to the burden included being a mother, low financial resources, non-Saudi nationality, children diagnosed with associated physical or psychological diseases, and caregiving hours. Conclusions The burden on SCA caregivers was higher for caregivers who were mothers, non-Saudis, those with lower income, and children with physical or psychological diseases, as well as more caregiving hours. Enhancing the overall well-being of families affected by the SCA burden involves creating targeted interventions and comprehensive support programs.","Sickle cell anemia (SCA) is an inherited chronic hemoglobinopathy that results in various complications, necessitating continuous daily care [<xref rid=""REF1"" ref-type=""bibr"">1</xref>]. Approximately 300,000 children are born with SCA worldwide [<xref rid=""REF2"" ref-type=""bibr"">2</xref>]. Regional variations in prevalence exist in Saudi Arabia [<xref rid=""REF3"" ref-type=""bibr"">3</xref>]. Caring for children with SCA introduces difficulties for caregivers [<xref rid=""REF4"" ref-type=""bibr"">4</xref>], with many exhibiting psychological distress [<xref rid=""REF5"" ref-type=""bibr"">5</xref>,<xref rid=""REF6"" ref-type=""bibr"">6</xref>]. A previous study revealed that 54% of caregivers were worried about worsening symptoms [<xref rid=""REF7"" ref-type=""bibr"">7</xref>]. Various caregiving responsibilities for children with SCA, such as administering medications, providing assistance during disease complications and crises, transporting the children to clinics and hospitals for treatment and visits, as well as managing communication with healthcare providers and schools, contribute to caregiver burden [<xref rid=""REF5"" ref-type=""bibr"">5</xref>,<xref rid=""REF8"" ref-type=""bibr"">8</xref>,<xref rid=""REF9"" ref-type=""bibr"">9</xref>]. Caregiver burden refers to the negative impact and strain experienced by individuals who provide care to a family member with a chronic illness or disability, such as SCA. It encompasses physical, emotional, social, and financial challenges that caregivers face in fulfilling their roles, manifesting as stress, exhaustion, frustration, sadness, and being overwhelmed, which affect social relationships, occupational functioning, and the personal wellbeing of caregivers [<xref rid=""REF8"" ref-type=""bibr"">8</xref>,<xref rid=""REF9"" ref-type=""bibr"">9</xref>]. Factors such as being a mother, low financial resources, frequent painful crises, and a lack of social assistance have been reported to influence caregiver burden [<xref rid=""REF8"" ref-type=""bibr"">8</xref>,<xref rid=""REF9"" ref-type=""bibr"">9</xref>]. Understanding the caregiver burden and identifying its contributing factors are crucial for improving the well-being of this population and may aid in developing policies, promoting evidence-based knowledge regarding the disease burden in the community, and encouraging premarital screening. To the best of our knowledge, no previous studies have explored the burden of caregivers of children with SCA in Madinah City, Saudi Arabia. Therefore, in this study, we aimed to assess this burden and its associated factors at the Maternity and Child Hospital in King Salman Medical City, Al Madinah Al Munawwarah, Saudi Arabia. Study setting and population This was an analytical cross-sectional study conducted from December 2023 to June 2024 at the Maternity and Child Hospital in King Salman Medical City, Al Madinah Al Munawwarah, Saudi Arabia. Caregivers of children with SCA were identified using the hospital’s database. All children with SCA registered in the hospital were recruited for this study, totaling 166 patients. Among these patients, 40 did not respond, and two refused to participate. Inclusion and exclusion criteria Children who were registered and received treatment at the hospital, aged ≤14 years, and resided in Al Madinah Al Munawwarah City were eligible for participation. Eligible caregivers included those who were providing care to children with SCA registered and treated at the same hospital, aged ≥18 years, and resided in Al Madinah Al Munawwarah City. Children in governmental social institutions (orphanages) were excluded. Caregivers who had been caring for affected children for <1 year and those who did not understand Arabic or English were also excluded. Ethical considerations This study was approved by the Ethics Committee of King Salman Medical City (approval number IRB23-055). Informed consent was obtained from the caregivers of each child before participation. We informed the participants that their involvement was voluntary, they had the right to withdraw from the study at any time without negative consequences, and we would treat all the information they provided in the questionnaire confidentially. Furthermore, it was emphasized that participation in the study had no potential harm. Data collection The data collection method involved contacting eligible participants via phone calls to obtain permission to participate in the study and ensure they understood the purpose of the study. Upon confirmation of their participation, a clear message was sent through WhatsApp, along with a Google Forms link containing the questionnaire and consent form, requesting that they complete it. Participants who did not respond initially were sent follow-up phone calls and messages as reminders to ensure participation. Study tool A self-administered questionnaire comprising three parts was used as the study tool. The first and second parts included the sociodemographic data of caregivers and children, respectively, whereas the third part included the validated Arabic version of the Zarit Burden Interview (ZBI) for the assessment of caregiver burden. The ZBI questionnaire was distributed in Arabic and constituted 22 questions, each rated on a 5-point Likert-type scale (0 [never] to 4 [nearly always]; total score range: 0-88). The level of burden was classified according to the total score as follows: 0-20, little or no burden; 21-40, mild to moderate burden; 41-60, moderate to severe burden; and 61-88, severe burden [<xref rid=""REF10"" ref-type=""bibr"">10</xref>]. The ZBI was initially developed in 1980 to evaluate the burden experienced by the caregivers of patients with Alzheimer’s disease. The ZBI has since become a widely used tool for evaluating caregiver burden and has been adapted into multiple languages. It has been extensively applied in clinical studies with published reports on caregivers of individuals with various physical and mental conditions, including SCA [<xref rid=""REF10"" ref-type=""bibr"">10</xref>,<xref rid=""REF11"" ref-type=""bibr"">11</xref>]. The psychometric properties of the ZBI have been extensively evaluated in caregivers, and the validity parameters for the Arabic version of the ZBI (Cronbach’s alpha = 0.8) and Arabic translations of the ZBI have good internal consistency and reliability [<xref rid=""REF12"" ref-type=""bibr"">12</xref>]. In this study, caregiver burden was defined as a ZBI score of >41. Statistical analysis All statistical analyses were performed using SPSS Statistics (version 29). The distribution of participants’ responses to questionnaire items was reported using descriptive statistics. Continuous data are presented as means and standard deviations, whereas categorical data are expressed as frequencies and percentages. The chi-squared and independent sample t-tests were used for inferential statistics. A multivariate logistic regression analysis was conducted. A 95% confidence interval (CI) was calculated, and statistical significance was set at a p-value of <0.05. The level of burden was assessed using the ZBI (the dependent variable) and categorized into two groups: no burden (scores of 0 to 40) and burden (scores of 41 to 88). Of 166 caregivers, 124 participated in the study (response rate, 74.7%). Overall, 83 (66.9%) of the caregivers were fathers, 72 (58.1%) were aged >40 years, 96 (77.4%) held a Saudi nationality, and 115 (92.7%) were married. Among all respondents, 52 (41.9%) had a university degree or higher, 63 (50.8%) were unemployed, and 62 (50%) had a monthly income of <5000 SAR (Table <xref rid=""TAB1"" ref-type=""table"">1</xref>). The average number of family members, daily caregiving hours for children, and time of care for children with SCA were 6±2.5, 5±4.7 hours, and 8±4.2 years, respectively (Table <xref rid=""TAB1"" ref-type=""table"">1</xref>). Among the families, 58 (46.8%) had more than one family member diagnosed with SCA, and 74 (59.7%) had a family member diagnosed with the SCA trait. Additionally, 86 (69.4%) caregivers were not diagnosed with associated physical or psychological diseases. Furthermore, 58 (46.8%) of families provided healthcare to more than one person in the family, and 110 (88.7%) reported having assistance in caring for children (Table <xref rid=""TAB2"" ref-type=""table"">2</xref>). Overall, 67 (54.0%) of children were boys, and 67 (54.0%) were aged ≤9 years. Regarding treatment, 74 (59.7%) of children received hydroxyurea, whereas 50 (40.3%) did not. Among the children, 30 (24.2%) were diagnosed with associated physical or psychological diseases (Table <xref rid=""TAB2"" ref-type=""table"">2</xref>). The analysis of the ZBI scores revealed that 45 (36.3%) of caregivers reported no burden, whereas 51 (41.1%), 22 (17.7%), and 6 (4.8%) reported mild, moderate, and severe burden, respectively (Table <xref rid=""TAB3"" ref-type=""table"">3</xref>). Regarding factors associated with caregiver burden for children with SCA, mothers were more likely to experience burden than fathers (odds ratio [OR]: 3.8, 95% CI: 1.58-9.10). Non-Saudi caregivers exhibited a higher likelihood of burden than Saudi caregivers (OR: 3.0, 95% CI: 1.20-7.56). Unemployed caregivers were more likely to experience burden than those employed in the government sector (OR: 5.1, 95% CI: 1.40-18.69). Additionally, caregivers with an income of <5000 SAR had a higher likelihood of burden than those with an income of >10000 SAR (OR: 10.3, 95% CI: 2.27-46.96) (Table <xref rid=""TAB4"" ref-type=""table"">4</xref>). Mean caregiving hours per day were higher among caregivers who reported burden (8.7±4.6) compared with those among caregivers who did not (3.6±4.1; p<0.001) (Table <xref rid=""TAB5"" ref-type=""table"">5</xref>). Caregivers of children diagnosed with physical or psychological diseases had a higher likelihood of experiencing burden than their counterparts (OR: 4.0, 95% CI: 1.62-9.99) (Table <xref rid=""TAB6"" ref-type=""table"">6</xref>). Multiple logistic regression analysis revealed that caregivers of children diagnosed with physical or psychological diseases had a higher likelihood of experiencing burden than caregivers of children without such diagnoses (OR: 6.9, 95% CI: 2.0-23.8, p = 0.001). Additionally, caregivers with a monthly income of <5000 SAR were more likely to experience a burden than those with an income >10,000 SAR (OR: 10.9, 95% CI: 1.8-64.8, p = 0.009). These findings indicated 20% higher odds of experiencing burden for every one-hour increase in caregiving duration (OR: 1.2, 95% CI: 1.1-1.4, p<0.001) (Table <xref rid=""TAB7"" ref-type=""table"">7</xref>). Our study sheds light on the burden faced by family caregivers of children with SCA, identifying key demographic and socioeconomic factors contributing to this burden. The results show that the average number of family members, the percentage of caregivers being unemployed, and those with a low income of <5000 SAR were 6±2.5, 50.8%, and 50%, respectively. Furthermore, mothers had a higher likelihood of experiencing a burden than fathers. Further insights from the study also examined sex distribution, age groups, and the presence of coexisting physical or psychological diseases in children with SCA and found a higher prevalence of SCA in boys (54.0%) and a higher proportion of affected children aged ≤ 9 years (54.0%). Additionally, our results reveal that caregivers of children diagnosed with physical or psychological diseases had a higher likelihood of experiencing burden, highlighting additional challenges faced by caregivers in managing younger children with coexisting health conditions. Madani et al. reported similar characteristics among caregivers of children with SCA in western Saudi Arabia, showing that larger families (average of 5±2.0 members) with limited financial resources (64.5%), housewife mothers (79.4%), and those lacking social assistance or health insurance (80%) experienced significant financial and emotional burdens [<xref rid=""REF8"" ref-type=""bibr"">8</xref>]. These burdens affected various aspects of their quality of life, including their social and professional lives [<xref rid=""REF8"" ref-type=""bibr"">8</xref>]. Kuerten et al. aimed to characterize the psychosocial burden experienced by caregivers of children with SCA in Kenya and identified predictors of the psychosocial burden, including disease severity and financial hardship. Their findings align with our results, suggesting that caregivers of children with SCA experienced difficulties across multiple domains of functioning and that financial hardships were likely to be associated with psychosocial burdens [<xref rid=""REF5"" ref-type=""bibr"">5</xref>]. Regarding caregiving hours, the study data showed that caregivers who devoted more hours to caregiving responsibilities were more likely to experience burden, suggesting that caregiving duration contributes to the overall burden experienced by caregivers. The result of this study is consistent with that of the existing literature, including a study by Madani et al. who examined the quality of life among caregivers of patients with SCA and highlighted that caregivers expressed the lowest satisfaction levels in certain areas, such as financial situation, free time activity, and life environment [<xref rid=""REF8"" ref-type=""bibr"">8</xref>]. Healthcare providers and support organizations should develop comprehensive strategies to alleviate the burden and promote overall well-being among caregivers by considering financial resources, caregiving hours, and the presence of coexisting health conditions. Our findings indicate that 36.3% of caregivers reported no burden, whereas 41.1%, 17.7%, and 4.8% had mild, moderate, and severe burden, respectively, based on the ZBI score. The reported caregiver burden varies among studies that used the ZBI. For example, a study conducted by Grygiel et al. in Grenada found that 53.8% of caregivers reported little to no burden, whereas 34.6% and 11.5% reported mild and moderate burden, respectively, with no reported cases of severe burden [<xref rid=""REF11"" ref-type=""bibr"">11</xref>]. By contrast, another study by Baker et al. in Jamaica reported that 26% of caregivers experienced little to no burden, whereas 61%, 12%, and 1% reported mild, moderate, and severe burden, respectively [<xref rid=""REF10"" ref-type=""bibr"">10</xref>]. The strength of this cross-sectional study lies in selecting the Maternity and Child Hospital at King Salman Medical City in Madinah, the primary governmental hospital in the region, which provides comprehensive healthcare services and specialized care. This choice enables extensive data collection from all registered files of children receiving treatment for SCA in the Madinah region, along with a robust response rate of 74.7% from family caregivers. This approach offers valuable insights into caregiver burden and the influence of sociodemographic and clinical factors in contributing to caregiving burden. Nevertheless, this study has some limitations, which must be considered when interpreting the findings. The cross-sectional nature of this study only provided a snapshot of caregiver burden, which may vary over time and in different disease situations. Furthermore, the single-center design restricts the applicability of our findings to a broader population. Future longitudinal studies with larger and more diverse samples should be conducted to address these limitations and further validate and generalize the findings. This study highlights the importance of understanding the intricate dynamics within families affected by SCA and the sociodemographic characteristics contributing to caregiver burden. Our results indicate that caregivers of SCA children with physical or psychological diseases were more susceptible to experiencing burden, particularly regarding caregiving hours. Furthermore, caregivers with lower incomes were more likely to experience a burden. Targeted interventions and comprehensive support programs can be developed by acknowledging the presence of vulnerable populations and identifying the factors associated with caregiver burden to alleviate the burden and enhance the overall well-being of family caregivers.",N/A,5 8 2024
Telomere Dynamics in Sickle Cell Anemia: Unraveling Molecular Aging and Disease Progression,"Sickle Cell Anemia (SCA) is a hereditary blood disorder characterized by the presence of abnormal hemoglobin, leading to the formation of sickle-shaped red blood cells. While extensive research has unraveled many aspects of the genetic and molecular basis of SCA, the role of telomere dynamics in disease progression remains a relatively unexplored frontier. This review seeks to provide a comprehensive examination of telomere biology within the context of SCA, aiming to elucidate its potential impact on molecular aging and the progression of the disease. The impact of oxidative stress on telomere dynamics in SCA is explored, with a particular focus on how increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) may contribute to accelerated telomere shortening and genomic instability. Furthermore, the potential relationship between telomere dysfunction and cellular senescence in SCA is investigated, shedding light on how telomere dynamics may contribute to the premature aging of cells in this population. The review concludes by summarizing key findings and proposing potential therapeutic strategies targeting telomere dynamics to mitigate disease progression in SCA. It also identifies gaps in current understanding and suggests avenues for future research, emphasizing the importance of further investigating telomere biology to advance our understanding of molecular aging and disease progression in Sickle Cell Anemia. This comprehensive exploration of telomere dynamics in SCA offers insights into potential mechanisms of molecular aging and disease progression, paving the way for targeted therapeutic interventions and improved disease management.","Sickle Cell Anemia (SCA) stands as a paradigmatic hematological disorder, characterized by the abnormal production of hemoglobin and the consequential formation of sickle-shaped erythrocytes.<xref rid=""cit0001"" ref-type=""bibr"">1–3</xref> While advancements in genetic and molecular research have significantly enhanced our understanding of SCA, certain facets of its pathophysiology, particularly the role of telomere dynamics, remain relatively unexplored. Telomeres, protective nucleoprotein structures at the ends of chromosomes, play a crucial role in preserving genomic integrity and cellular function.<xref rid=""cit0004"" ref-type=""bibr"">4</xref> Given their significance in normal cellular processes, disruptions in telomere dynamics may have far-reaching consequences. This review endeavors to provide a comprehensive exploration of telomere biology within the context of SCA, aiming to unravel its potential implications for molecular aging and disease progression. Understanding the molecular intricacies of SCA, coupled with insights into telomere dynamics, holds the promise of shedding light on novel mechanisms influencing the course of the disease. SCA arises from a point mutation in the β-globin gene, leading to the synthesis of abnormal hemoglobin (HbS). The resultant sickle-shaped erythrocytes contribute to vaso-occlusive events, hemolysis, and a myriad of clinical complications. While much attention has been given to the genetic determinants and molecular events underpinning SCA, the impact of telomere dynamics on disease progression remains an area warranting exploration.<xref rid=""cit0005"" ref-type=""bibr"">5</xref>,<xref rid=""cit0006"" ref-type=""bibr"">6</xref> Telomere dysfunction has been implicated in various hematological and aging-related disorders. Understanding its role in SCA could provide novel insights into the molecular mechanisms driving the disease.<xref rid=""cit0007"" ref-type=""bibr"">7</xref> This review is prompted by the need to synthesize existing knowledge on telomere dynamics in SCA, elucidating their potential contribution to molecular aging and disease progression. Sickle Cell Anemia (SCA) is a complex disorder characterized by the presence of abnormal hemoglobin S, which leads to the sickling of red blood cells. This sickling process triggers a cascade of pathophysiological mechanisms including chronic hemolysis, vaso-occlusive events, and widespread inflammation. These processes impose considerable stress on various cell types, particularly hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs), which are responsible for the continuous replenishment of blood cells. The high turnover rate of these cells, combined with persistent oxidative stress and inflammatory signals, results in accelerated telomere shortening in individuals with SCA. Telomeres, which protect chromosome ends from deterioration, naturally shorten with each cell division. However, in SCA, this shortening is exacerbated, leading to premature cellular senescence or apoptosis, thereby contributing to the overall disease burden and progression. The advent of gene therapy for SCA holds significant promise in addressing telomere shortening-associated aging. By correcting the underlying genetic defect, gene therapy can potentially reduce the chronic hemolysis and inflammation that drive excessive cell turnover and oxidative stress. Consequently, this reduction could alleviate the accelerated telomere attrition observed in SCA patients. By stabilizing telomere length, gene therapy may not only improve hematopoietic stem cell function and longevity but also mitigate the premature aging and comorbidities associated with SCA. This therapeutic approach represents a transformative shift in managing SCA, offering hope for improved quality of life and prolonged health span for patients suffering from this debilitating condition.<xref rid=""cit0002"" ref-type=""bibr"">2</xref>,<xref rid=""cit0003"" ref-type=""bibr"">3</xref> Recent advancements in gene therapy have ushered in a new era of potential treatments for Sickle Cell Anemia (SCA), offering hope for addressing the genetic root of this debilitating disease. Traditional therapies have primarily focused on managing symptoms and complications, but gene therapy aims to correct the underlying genetic defect, thereby altering the disease trajectory fundamentally. One of the most promising approaches involves using CRISPR-Cas9 technology to edit the HBB gene, thereby correcting the mutation responsible for the production of sickle hemoglobin. By targeting the source of hemoglobin abnormalities, gene therapy could significantly reduce hemolysis, inflammation, and oxidative stress—all of which are major contributors to telomere shortening in SCA patients. The potential impact of successful gene therapy on telomere dynamics in SCA patients could be profound. As gene therapy reduces the burden of sickled red blood cells, it is likely to decrease the chronic inflammatory state and oxidative damage that drive telomere attrition. Consequently, patients might experience a slowdown in the accelerated telomere shortening associated with SCA, potentially mitigating premature cellular aging and reducing the risk of age-related comorbidities. Additionally, by preserving telomere length, gene therapy could enhance the longevity and functionality of hematopoietic stem cells, thereby improving the overall hematopoietic system’s resilience and reducing the frequency of complications such as vaso-occlusive crises. This could not only extend the lifespan of SCA patients but also significantly enhance their quality of life.<xref rid=""cit0004"" ref-type=""bibr"">4–7</xref>

By bridging the knowledge gap between telomere biology and SCA, this review contributes to a broader comprehension of molecular aging and disease progression in this hematological disorder. Telomere dynamics play a critical role in the pathophysiology of sickle cell anemia (SCA), influencing both disease progression and the molecular aging process. The accelerated telomere shortening observed in SCA patients, driven by oxidative stress, chronic inflammation, and DNA damage, contributes to the severity of the disease and its complications. Shortened telomeres are associated with increased frequency of vaso-occlusive crises, severe anemia, and early onset of organ damage, making telomere length a potential prognostic marker for disease severity and progression. Interventions aimed at reducing oxidative stress and inflammation, enhancing DNA repair mechanisms, and potentially activating telomerase could help preserve telomere length and improve clinical outcomes for SCA patients. Additionally, monitoring telomere length could provide valuable insights into disease progression and aid in the personalization of treatment plans.",N/A,26 7 2024
Conservative management of segmental testicular infarction in a patient with sickle cell anemia: A case report,"Vaso-occlusive crisis is a sequela of sickle cell disease that can lead to severe pain and infarction at the location of occlusion. In men, genitourinary complications include priapism, hematuria, and very rarely, testicular infarction. Few cases have been previously reported in the literature, but in all of those cases, partial or complete orchiectomy was performed. We report the first known case of segmental testicular infarct secondary to sickle cell disease treated with medical management without need for surgical intervention.","Sickle cell trait (SCT) is one of the most common hematological disorders worldwide.

Prior reported cases of testicular infarction have been managed with orchiectomy or testicular exploration leading to resection. In this article, we present the first known case of testicular infarction managed conservatively without surgical intervention. A 33-year-old male with SCD presented to the emergency department with left lower quadrant abdominal pain, joint pain, nausea and vomiting. The patient reported that this prodrome was typical of previous sickle cell crises. He has a significant history of SCD complications, including acute chest syndrome, avascular necrosis of multiple joints, and liver infarcts. He was previously taking hydroxyurea; however, he discontinued this due to adverse side effects and lack of insurance coverage. His home medications included folic acid supplements and laxatives. He had a past surgical history significant for cholecystectomy with no prior urologic surgeries. Upon admission to the hospital, he was normotensive and afebrile. Vaso-occlusive crisis was suspected. Laboratory studies revealed anemia (Hb = 8.2 g/dL), thrombocytosis, leukocytosis, and hyperbilirubinemia (total = 3.3, direct = 0.7). CT of abdomen and pelvis showed no acute inflammatory abdominal processes. Chest X-ray showed no evidence of acute chest syndrome. He was initially managed with aggressive IV fluids and multimodal pain control, with brief improvement of pain, leukocytosis and hyperbilirubinemia. Two days later, he reported worsening pain with new-onset radiation to his left testicle. On physical examination, his left testicle was tender to palpation with no other significant findings. At this time, a scrotal ultrasound with Doppler was obtained and showed an approximately 1.6 x 1.2 × 1.1 cm wedge-shaped area of decreased echogenicity and decreased vascularity likely representing a subacute infarct (<xref rid=""fig1"" ref-type=""fig"">Fig. 1</xref>, <xref rid=""fig2"" ref-type=""fig"">Fig. 2</xref>).

The patient received an exchange transfusion and 1 unit of HbS-negative blood with improvement of HbS to 25.8 % from 77.4 %. He continued to improve post-exchange transfusion with no further urologic complications. By hospital day 6, his pain improved with reduction in need for pain regimen, and he was discharged with plans to follow up in clinic 4–6 weeks later for repeat imaging. Unfortunately, the patient was lost to urology follow-up due to lack of insurance. However, he saw primary care providers approximately 6 months after his initial presentation and had improved physical examination. Segmental testicular infarction is a rarely reported manifestation of vaso-occlusive crisis in patients with SCT or SCD. Only 7 cases have been previously reported in the literature, 1 of which is reported in German and thus excluded from discussion. Patients often present with acute onset testicular pain, progressively worsening with associated swelling and tenderness on physical exam.<xref rid=""bib4"" ref-type=""bibr"">4</xref>, <xref rid=""bib5"" ref-type=""bibr"">5</xref>, <xref rid=""bib6"" ref-type=""bibr"">6</xref>, <xref rid=""bib7"" ref-type=""bibr"">7</xref>, <xref rid=""bib8"" ref-type=""bibr"">8</xref>, <xref rid=""bib9"" ref-type=""bibr"">9</xref> In 2 cases, antibiotics were prescribed for suspicion of underlying infection with no effect.<xref rid=""bib4"" ref-type=""bibr""><sup>4</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid=""bib5"" ref-type=""bibr""><sup>5</sup></xref> None of the previously reported patients nor our patient were taking hydroxyurea at the time of presentation.

Scrotal ultrasound with Doppler showed a well-circumscribed, hypoechogenic area with decreased or absent arterial flow, while surrounding parenchyma exhibits normal echogenicity and blood flow. A major reported diagnostic issue leading to surgical intervention was inability to distinguish infarct from malignancy on ultrasound.

Our case is unique in that surgical intervention was unnecessary.

Hydroxyurea, which primarily works by increasing the levels of fetal hemoglobin (HbF), has been shown to cause a 44 % reduction in vaso-occlusive crises, hospitalization and need for transfusions.<xref rid=""bib10"" ref-type=""bibr"">10</xref>, <xref rid=""bib11"" ref-type=""bibr"">11</xref>, <xref rid=""bib12"" ref-type=""bibr"">12</xref> Finally, exchange transfusions are used to decrease the level of pathological HbS. In our patient, hydroxyurea therapy was not considered due to a history of adverse effects; however, supportive treatment including IV fluids, adequate pain management and exchange transfusions were used to excellent effect. While surgical intervention was unnecessary following initial treatment, surgery may be considered to shorten the disease course or when the diagnosis of infarct is unclear. Testicular infarction as a manifestation of SCT or SCD is a rare but potentially significant urologic complication. This diagnosis can be suspected in patients with acute, progressive testicular pain and swelling. Scrotal ultrasound with Doppler shows a well-circumscribed hypoechoic area and significantly decreased intratesticular flow. Orchiectomy is often pursued due to an inability to rule out malignancy from imaging alone. As discussed in this case, medical management including supportive therapy, preventative pharmacotherapy, and exchange transfusions can be effective, presenting an option for conservative management of this rare condition.

"Association of <italic toggle=""yes"">ZBTB38</italic> gene polymorphism (rs724016) with height and fetal hemoglobin in individuals with sickle cell anemia",,"Sickle cell anemia (SCA), defined by homozygosity for the hemoglobin S (HbS) allele, is characterized by episodes of hemolysis and vaso-occlusion triggered by deoxygenation of HbS [<xref rid=""bb0005"" ref-type=""bibr"">1</xref>]. Patients with SCA exhibit variable degrees of organic dysfunction, which can affect multiple organs and compromise statural growth. Although SCA is more prevalent in sub-Saharan Africa, the Mediterranean basin, the Middle East, and India, successive migration waves have made the disease a global health problem [<xref rid=""bb0010"" ref-type=""bibr"">2</xref>]. The height of children with SCA living in resource-poor regions is lower due to a combination of factors, including worse health conditions and a higher prevalence of nutritional deficiencies [<xref rid=""bb0015"" ref-type=""bibr"">3</xref>]. However, an elevated level of fetal hemoglobin (HbF) represents the most important modifier of the severity of SCA, as it can reduce morbidity and mortality, and protect against complications related to growth [<xref rid=""bb0015"" ref-type=""bibr"">3</xref>]. HbF is the predominant hemoglobin at birth, then HbF synthesis declines and adult hemoglobin (HbA) becomes the most common hemoglobin (Hb) in children without hemoglobinopathies, while HbS becomes predominant in children with SCA [<xref rid=""bb0020"" ref-type=""bibr"">4</xref>]. Because of the progressive decline in HbF levels in children with SCA, the first manifestations of the disease begin after 6 months of age, which coincides with the onset of risk for growth impairment [<xref rid=""bb0005"" ref-type=""bibr"">1</xref>,<xref rid=""bb0015"" ref-type=""bibr"">3</xref>,<xref rid=""bb0020"" ref-type=""bibr"">4</xref>]. Growth impairment in children with SCA is progressive during childhood and may worsen during puberty, as delayed onset of puberty is common in patients with SCA [<xref rid=""bb0015"" ref-type=""bibr"">3</xref>]. Hydroxyurea (HU) therapy can attenuate the tendency for HbF levels to decline after birth and prevent disease complications. In some locations, HU therapy is restricted to children with SCA who are older than 2 years and have complications of the disease, although many authors recommend treatment for all children with SCA [<xref rid=""bb0025"" ref-type=""bibr"">5</xref>]. Co-inheritance of alpha-thalassemia, in combination with HbF levels and HU therapy, is another important modifying factor of sickle cell anemia. Previous studies have suggested the possibility that co-inheritance of alpha-thalassemia may impair the growth of children with SCA by affecting the growth hormone/insulin-like growth factor 1 (GH/IGF-1) axis [<xref rid=""bb0030"" ref-type=""bibr"">6</xref>]. Genetic factors represent >90% of the variability in human height, according to heritability estimates using monozygotic and dizygotic twins [<xref rid=""bb0035"" ref-type=""bibr"">7</xref>]. Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) confirm the polygenic nature of the trait by showing hundreds of common variants associated with height. The loci in the <italic toggle=""yes"">ZBTB38</italic> (zinc finger and BTB domain-containing 38) gene are considered the most frequently associated with height in GWAS [<xref rid=""bb0040"" ref-type=""bibr"">8</xref>,<xref rid=""bb0045"" ref-type=""bibr"">9</xref>]. The effect on the height of some single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) can vary in different populations [<xref rid=""bb0050"" ref-type=""bibr"">10</xref>], however, the SNP rs724016 in the <italic toggle=""yes"">ZBTB38</italic> was associated with growth when several aspects were evaluated, such as length at birth (LB) [<xref rid=""bb0055"" ref-type=""bibr"">11</xref>], population of Chinese with short stature [<xref rid=""bb0040"" ref-type=""bibr"">8</xref>], individuals of European ancestry [<xref rid=""bb0060"" ref-type=""bibr"">12</xref>] and individuals with African ancestry [<xref rid=""bb0050"" ref-type=""bibr"">10</xref>]. Despite the diversity of height GWAS, common allelic variants have not been studied in individuals with SCA. In turn, HbF levels are a heritable trait whose modulating elements are poorly understood, and less than half of its genetic variance is explained [<xref rid=""bb0005"" ref-type=""bibr"">1</xref>]. Additionally, most genetic variants associated with stature or HbF levels in GWAS act on transcriptional regulation [<xref rid=""bb0005"" ref-type=""bibr"">1</xref>,<xref rid=""bb0065"" ref-type=""bibr"">13</xref>]. Variants associated with transcription factors, such as the ZBTB38, often act pleiotropically by modifying the expression of multiple genes. While there is increasing effort to conduct studies to assess pleiotropically associated variants with complex traits, such as stature [<xref rid=""bb0065"" ref-type=""bibr"">13</xref>], studies involving smaller populations, such as individuals with SCA, or evaluating HbF levels have not yet been carried out. Therefore, it is important to attempt to replicate the results of GWAS of stature in individuals with SCA, as well as to evaluate the influence of HbF levels on the obtained outcomes. We hypothesized that the <italic toggle=""yes"">ZBTB38</italic>, which is highly expressed in hematopoietic tissue, may have pleiotropic effects on the growth and HbF levels of individuals with SCA. The aim of the study was to assess the association of the rs724016 of the <italic toggle=""yes"">ZBTB38</italic> with anthropometric data and HbF levels in individuals with SCA aged 3 to 20 years. The data were also associated with other factors capable of influencing the growth of children with SCA. Therefore, we evaluated the association of the polymorphism with levels of IGF-1 and IGFBP-3, as an estimate of the function of the GH/IGF-1 axis. Additionally, we adjusted the data for the main modifiers of SCA, which are HbF levels, HU therapy, and co-inheritance of alpha-thalassemia.

The association of rs724016 genotypes with the GH/IGF-1 axis, represented by BA-adjusted IGF-1 and IGFBP-3 levels, was also tested in the GLM that incorporated the same independent variables used to evaluate the anthropometric data as an outcome.

Our study showed an association of SNP rs724016 in the <italic toggle=""yes"">ZBTB38</italic> gene with shorter height in patients with SCA. Although HbF levels are recognized as a principal factor in reducing complications in SCA, they were not associated with height SDS or with IGF-1 and IGFBP-3 levels in our study. However, HbF levels showed a positive association with the growth potential of individuals with SCA, estimated by the deficit in predicting adult height adjusted for parental height (TH minus PAH). Additionally, the G variant of rs724016 showed a significant negative association with HbF levels, suggesting that this variant may negatively affect the height of individuals with SCA by being associated with lower HbF levels. Height is a complex and highly polygenic genetic trait. GWAS primarily assess common polymorphisms, which, when considered collectively, can account for up to 45% of the variation in human height. This estimation was derived from a study involving 5.4 million individuals from diverse ancestries and an evaluation of 12,111 SNPs [<xref rid=""bb0090"" ref-type=""bibr"">18</xref>]. These genetic variants can impact human height by influencing various tissues, including endocrine glands, bone structure, and growth plates. On an individual basis, each allele can have an impact on height of <0.5 cm [<xref rid=""bb0095"" ref-type=""bibr"">19</xref>]. Several GWAS studies have associated the G allele of rs724016 in the <italic toggle=""yes"">ZBTB38</italic> with greater height [<xref rid=""bb0050"" ref-type=""bibr"">[10]</xref>, <xref rid=""bb0055"" ref-type=""bibr"">[11]</xref>, <xref rid=""bb0060"" ref-type=""bibr"">[12]</xref>,<xref rid=""bb0100"" ref-type=""bibr"">20</xref>]. Although the direction of effect of our data was different from the GWAS, the association we found between the G allele of rs724016 and shorter LB has the same direction of effect as that of a recent study with a cohort of 261 children with short stature of undefined etiology [<xref rid=""bb0045"" ref-type=""bibr"">9</xref>]. GWAS involve large populations, but often the effect of variants found in a study does not apply to other populations. The lack of transferability between populations is due to failures in sample stratification, small samples with low statistical power, epigenetic factors, and different linkage disequilibrium pattern, which affects the interaction between genes [<xref rid=""bb0050"" ref-type=""bibr"">10</xref>,<xref rid=""bb0105"" ref-type=""bibr"">21</xref>]. Using epigenetic factors, the variants can interact with the environment and be heterogeneously associated with the phenotypes, which may explain the difference in the impact of some variants on height according to age, pubertal stage, and sex [<xref rid=""bb0045"" ref-type=""bibr"">9</xref>,<xref rid=""bb0050"" ref-type=""bibr"">10</xref>]. The SNP rs724016 is in the intron of the <italic toggle=""yes"">ZBTB38</italic> at 3q23, which encodes a zinc finger transcription factor that binds to methylated CpG dinucleotides at various sites in the human genome involved in the control of gene expression. Although the role of the ZBTB38 in height is not defined, its importance in the regulation of apoptosis leads to the assumption that its participation in the chondrocytes of the epiphyseal plate may impact on height [<xref rid=""bb0110"" ref-type=""bibr"">22</xref>]. Additionally, binding of ZBTB38 to the differently methylated <italic toggle=""yes"">H19/IGF2</italic> locus at 11p15 [<xref rid=""bb0115"" ref-type=""bibr"">23</xref>,<xref rid=""bb0120"" ref-type=""bibr"">24</xref>] associates its role in growth with increased IGF-2 synthesis, as occurs in some genetic syndromes. Like IGF-1, IGF-2 binds to receptors on growth plate chondrocytes involved in hypertrophic differentiation, which results in embryonic and postnatal growth [<xref rid=""bb0125"" ref-type=""bibr"">25</xref>]. Beckwith-Widermann hypergrowth syndrome is characterized by changes in the methylation pattern at the <italic toggle=""yes"">H19/IGF2</italic> locus, leading to an increase in <italic toggle=""yes"">IGF2</italic> expression in fetal life [<xref rid=""bb0130"" ref-type=""bibr"">26</xref>]. Silver-Russel syndrome is associated with a decrease in <italic toggle=""yes"">IGF2</italic> expression, which compromises intrauterine and postnatal growth [<xref rid=""bb0135"" ref-type=""bibr"">27</xref>]. Variants associated with complex traits such as height often act in gene regulation through DNA methylation [<xref rid=""bb0065"" ref-type=""bibr"">13</xref>], which may alter the expression of many genes and have a pleiotropic effect, as our result suggests when associating the SNP rs724016 in the <italic toggle=""yes"">ZBTB38</italic> with lower HbF levels in individuals with SCA. High IGF-2 levels can compromise the homeostasis and regeneration of hematopoietic stem cells, generating senescence of young hematopoietic cells [<xref rid=""bb0140"" ref-type=""bibr"">28</xref>,<xref rid=""bb0145"" ref-type=""bibr"">29</xref>]. Additionally, as primitive erythrocytes differentiate into a definitive lineage, there is also a decrease in the expression of the γ-globin gene, important for the synthesis of HbF [<xref rid=""bb0150"" ref-type=""bibr"">30</xref>]. HbF (α2γ2) is formed by 2 α- chains and 2 γ-globin chains that are encoded by two different genes located in the β-globin gene cluster. HbF protects people with SCA from complications of the disease by inhibiting the formation of deoxygenated Hb polymer, preventing cellular damage associated with hemolysis and vaso-occlusion [<xref rid=""bb0155"" ref-type=""bibr"">31</xref>]. Therefore, we consider that the effect of the G allele of rs724016 may decrease the synthesis of HbF by increasing <italic toggle=""yes"">IGF2</italic> expression, leading to permanent differentiation of hematopoietic stem cells into erythrocyte lineages that do not have HbF synthesis. Although elevated IGF-2 levels may be associated with greater height in other populations, we believe that low HbF levels have a greater impact on individuals with SCA, who start to have a greater number of vaso-occlusive crisis (VOC), which in turn secondarily compromise the GH/IGF-1 axis and chondrocytes of the epiphyseal plate (<xref rid=""f0010"" ref-type=""fig"">Fig. 2</xref>). On the other hand, the excessive production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) by HbS in SCA represents a significant therapeutic target of the disease due to its ability to promote vaso-occlusion, endothelial dysfunction, hemolysis, and inflammation [<xref rid=""bb0160"" ref-type=""bibr"">32</xref>]. In this regard, studies in human cells have demonstrated the importance of the ZBTB38 in controlling oxidative stress by limiting intracellular levels of ROS [<xref rid=""bb0165"" ref-type=""bibr"">33</xref>]. Therefore, the rs724016 of the <italic toggle=""yes"">ZBTB38</italic> may be associated with shorter stature in individuals with SCA due to its ability to increase oxidative stress, which leads to organic dysfunction. For a better understanding of the presumed mechanisms, it is necessary to conduct functional studies with the ZBTB38, validate the results in studies with greater statistical power, evaluate the interaction with epigenetic mechanisms, and assess the existence of linkage disequilibrium variants capable of interfering with the results.<fig id=""f0010""><label>Fig. 2</label><caption><p>Model for the association of the SNP rs724016 (<italic toggle=""yes"">ZBTB38</italic>) with the GH/IGF-1 axis, height, and fetal hemoglobin (HbF) levels in sickle cell anemia (SCA). The figure shows that despite the positive effect of the SNP rs724016 on the growth plate by increasing IGF-2 synthesis, its main effect in SCA depends on the negative impact of IGF-2 on young hematopoietic cells. As a result, lower HbF synthesis aggravates the disease, progressing with the impairment of the growth plate and the GH/IGF-1 axis.</p><p>ALS, acid labile subunit.</p></caption><alt-text id=""al0010"">Fig. 2</alt-text><graphic http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink href=""gr2"" id=""lk0010""></graphic></fig> Changes in the GH/IGF-1 axis are often implicated in changes in the growth of individuals with SCA [<xref rid=""bb0030"" ref-type=""bibr"">6</xref>,<xref rid=""bb0170"" ref-type=""bibr"">34</xref>]. The pituitary gland is a well-known gland sensitive to iron overload injury, while in SCA the pituitary gland may also be susceptible to organic dysfunction, which can compromise the secretion of GH and the synthesis of IGF-1 and IGFBP-3. However, improvements in healthcare, particularly with the more frequent use of HU, have reduced the impact of the disease on growth [<xref rid=""bb0025"" ref-type=""bibr"">5</xref>,<xref rid=""bb0170"" ref-type=""bibr"">34</xref>,<xref rid=""bb0175"" ref-type=""bibr"">35</xref>]. HU can increase the number of erythroblasts synthesizing HbF in the bone marrow, and the elevation of HbF levels represents the main mechanism of action of the medication in preventing disease complications [<xref rid=""bb0155"" ref-type=""bibr"">31</xref>]. Numerous safety studies of HU therapy have contributed to its growing utilization worldwide [<xref rid=""bb0180"" ref-type=""bibr"">36</xref>]. However, in countries with limited resources, its usage remains less frequent or at lower doses due to concerns regarding myelotoxicity, which necessitates increased spending on clinical and laboratory monitoring of this complication [<xref rid=""bb0185"" ref-type=""bibr"">37</xref>].Therefore, despite many authors recommending HU for all children with SCA, only half of the study population had been using HU for at least 1 year. This is due to local guidelines that restrict its prescription to the most severe cases. This study shows a positive association of HU therapy with higher adjusted IGF-1 and IGFBP-3 levels, and with HbF levels. Although height is not significantly associated with HU therapy in our study, we believe this is justified by the observational characteristics of our study, in which only individuals with the most severe disease received HU therapy. The absence of a difference in reporting VOC in the last year between the groups of patients who underwent HU therapy and those who did not is also justified by the observational aspect of the study. Patients under HU therapy likely received the medication due to having a more severe disease, yet they behaved similarly to untreated patients regarding the frequency of VOC, the main complication of the disease. Thus, in the HU therapy group were also most patients under chronic transfusion therapy, which is known to compromise the GH/IGF-1 axis and height through iron overload without adequate chelation [<xref rid=""bb0175"" ref-type=""bibr"">35</xref>]. Although IGF-1 can compromise HbF synthesis by sharing the same intracellular signaling pattern with IGF-2 [<xref rid=""bb0190"" ref-type=""bibr"">38</xref>], our study does not show this association. Although the secretion of IGF-2 is not dependent on the secretion of GH, as is the secretion of IGF-1, IGFBP-3, and acid labile subunit (ALS), it is also secreted in the liver and dependent on the complex formed with the ALS and IGFBP-3. In this way, the performance of IGF-2 and IGF-1 in the tissues will depend on the availability of the free fraction of the hormone, which in turn depends on the degree of affinity that the hormone binding establishes with the complex and the stability that the complex provides by increasing the circulating half-life of IGFs [<xref rid=""bb0135"" ref-type=""bibr"">27</xref>]. Anemia has a multifactorial etiology and is characterized by a reduction in the ability to transport oxygen to tissues, which can impact the growth of children, especially younger ones [<xref rid=""bb0195"" ref-type=""bibr"">[39]</xref>, <xref rid=""bb0200"" ref-type=""bibr"">[40]</xref>, <xref rid=""bb0205"" ref-type=""bibr"">[41]</xref>]. Regarding children with hemoglobinopathies, the need for repeated transfusions can lead to iron overload, and if they do not receive adequate chelation, their growth may also be affected [<xref rid=""bb0210"" ref-type=""bibr"">42</xref>,<xref rid=""bb0215"" ref-type=""bibr"">43</xref>]. In our study, anthropometric outcomes and those related to the GH/IGF-1 axis were adjusted for Hb and ferritin levels; however, there was no significance in the association. Other studies evaluating children with sickle cell anemia confirm the lack of definition, where some authors mention the absence of association between Hb levels and anthropometric data [<xref rid=""bb0015"" ref-type=""bibr"">3</xref>], while a study that assessed a population of 33 adolescents with SCA showed a significant positive association between Hb levels and stature [<xref rid=""bb0220"" ref-type=""bibr"">44</xref>]. In the present study, we found co-inheritance of alpha-thalassemia in 14.1% of participants, consistent with global data that show the condition affecting around 10 to 30% of people with SCA [<xref rid=""bb0225"" ref-type=""bibr"">45</xref>,<xref rid=""bb0230"" ref-type=""bibr"">46</xref>]. Alpha-thalassemia is caused by impaired synthesis of the α-globin chain, which is regulated by four genes in two loci on chromosome 16p13.3. The impairment of one or two α-globin genes, the most common molecular defect, leads to mild forms of alpha-thalassemia, which may manifest solely with microcytosis [<xref rid=""bb0235"" ref-type=""bibr"">47</xref>]. Some complications of the disease such as stroke, cholelithiasis, and chronic kidney disease are less frequent in individuals with co-inheritance of alpha-thalassemia, while others such as osteonecrosis, splenic sequestration, and VOC are purportedly more frequent [<xref rid=""bb0240"" ref-type=""bibr"">48</xref>]. The decrease in the production of α-globin subunits in individuals with alpha-thalassemia co-inheritance favors the reduction of intracellular HbS concentration, resulting in decreased formation of deoxygenated Hb polymers, reduced hemolysis, and VOC, justifying the beneficial effects of the condition [<xref rid=""bb0245"" ref-type=""bibr"">49</xref>]. On the other hand, decreased hemolysis increases hematocrit and purportedly also red blood cell adhesiveness, favoring the increased frequency of VOC, explaining cases where co-inheritance exacerbate SCA complications [<xref rid=""bb0250"" ref-type=""bibr"">50</xref>]. Although adjusted IGFBP-3 levels and anthropometric data were not associated with alpha-thalassemia co-inheritance in our study, IGF-1 levels were negatively associated with <italic toggle=""yes"">HBA</italic> gene deletion. This pattern of association between IGF-1 levels and co-inheritance of alpha-thalassemia was previously reported in a study of children with SCA [<xref rid=""bb0030"" ref-type=""bibr"">6</xref>], suggesting the modulating effect that the condition establishes by predisposing to a greater number of vaso-occlusive events and disease complications [<xref rid=""bb0225"" ref-type=""bibr"">45</xref>]. The study has some limitations, such as the small sample size, which increases the risk of a type I statistical error when analyzing polymorphisms with an allele frequency >0.3 [<xref rid=""bb0255"" ref-type=""bibr"">51</xref>], and many missing data, especially those that depended on information regarding LB, BA, and HbF levels. The lack of BA data was primarily due to logistical challenges, as the examination wasn't available at the same facility where patients were seen. This missing BA data also affected other assessments, particularly the measurement of serum levels of IGF-1 and IGFBP-3, which were adjusted based on BA, as well as the calculation of PAH, reducing the accuracy of assessments involving these data. Missing data in other assessments, such as HbF levels, were due to occasional errors in the laboratory records. Birth length measurement is critical for assessing growth, as up to 15% of infants born SGA experience short stature unrelated to SCA. The complexity of BL measurement, requiring assistance and gestational age information, led to a higher rate of missing BL data compared to birth weight. However, positive events like a history of SGA births are more easily recalled, suggesting that missing birth data may be due to its normalcy. Additionally, the history of low birth weight (LBW), including premature infants, was evaluated in a larger group (<italic toggle=""yes"">n</italic> = 63). The incidence of LBW in Latin America (9%) closely matches our findings (11%), indicating similar intrauterine growth issues between our study group and the general population. We considered the missing data to be random and chose not to exclude participants to maintain the statistical power for our main assessments, including the association of rs724016 with stature and HbF levels. Our approach contrasts with GWAS by including adjustments for various factors and using different genetic models, which enhances the depth of our analysis compared to the typical additive model used in GWAS studies. In conclusion, our study in a population of individuals with SCA shows a negative association of a common variant in the <italic toggle=""yes"">ZBTB38</italic> (rs724016) with height, in the opposite direction of effect to GWAS. The study supports the importance of replicating data from large GWAS in other populations with distinctive characteristics that may alter the relationship between genes through epigenetic factors or linkage disequilibrium. Additionally, our data associates the SNP rs724016 with lower HbF levels, the main modifier factor of SCA. <bold>Domício Antônio Costa-Júnior:</bold> Writing – review & editing, Writing – original draft, Methodology, Investigation, Formal analysis, Data curation, Conceptualization. <bold>Thaisa N.

"Malnutrition in sickle cell anemia: Prevalence, impact, and interventions: A Review","Sickle Cell Anemia (SCA) is a hereditary hemoglobinopathy characterized by chronic hemolytic anemia, vaso-occlusive events, and a wide range of clinical complications. Malnutrition, often an underexplored aspect of this complex condition, plays a critical role in disease management and overall patient well-being. This publication provides a comprehensive review of the prevalence, impact, and interventions related to malnutrition in individuals with SCA. A thorough literature review reveals the multifaceted challenges faced by SCA patients in maintaining adequate nutrition. The pathophysiology of SCA, involving chronic inflammation, oxidative stress, and hypermetabolism, contributes to increased nutritional requirements and altered dietary patterns. Factors such as reduced appetite, nutrient malabsorption, dietary restrictions, and socioeconomic disparities further exacerbate the risk of malnutrition. Malnutrition is a prevalent issue among individuals with SCA, affecting patients of different age groups and disease severities. Nutritional deficiencies, including vitamins, minerals, and essential nutrients, are common in this population. The impact of malnutrition on disease outcomes is significant, with associations between nutrient status and complications such as pain crises, infections, and impaired quality of life. This paper also reviews nutritional interventions aimed at addressing malnutrition in SCA patients. While dietary counseling, supplementation, and personalized nutrition plans have shown promise in improving nutritional status, challenges such as patient adherence and access to healthcare must be addressed to optimize their effectiveness.","Sickle cell anemia (SCA), a genetic hemoglobinopathy characterized by the production of abnormal hemoglobin, has been the subject of extensive research and clinical investigation. Individuals living with SCA face a myriad of challenges, from chronic pain and vaso-occlusive events to a higher risk of infections. Yet, one facet of the disease that has garnered relatively less attention but is of paramount importance is malnutrition. Malnutrition in SCA is a multifaceted concern with significant implications for both the physical and overall well-being of patients.<sup>[<xref rid=""R1"" ref-type=""bibr"">1</xref>–<xref rid=""R5"" ref-type=""bibr"">5</xref>]</sup> SCA is prevalent in regions with a high prevalence of malaria, and in many of these areas, malnutrition is a concomitant issue. The disease itself, through its complex pathophysiology, introduces unique nutritional requirements and challenges, affecting the dietary patterns and nutrient status of patients. In addition, socioeconomic disparities, limited access to healthcare, and dietary restrictions compound the issue. The prevalence of malnutrition in individuals with SCA is an emerging concern that deserves a more comprehensive exploration.<sup>[<xref rid=""R6"" ref-type=""bibr"">6</xref>–<xref rid=""R9"" ref-type=""bibr"">9</xref>]</sup> This paper seeks to address the critical aspects of malnutrition in SCA, including its prevalence, impact on disease outcomes, and potential interventions. The underlying pathophysiological processes of SCA, which involve chronic inflammation, oxidative stress, and hypermetabolism, elevate the nutritional needs of patients. The altered dietary habits and nutrient deficiencies, common among SCA patients, can exacerbate their vulnerability to a range of clinical complications.<sup>[<xref rid=""R10"" ref-type=""bibr"">10</xref>]</sup> The impact of malnutrition on the SCA population is far-reaching. It is associated with an increased frequency of pain crises, more extended hospitalizations, delayed growth and development, and compromised quality of life. Despite its evident significance, malnutrition often remains under-addressed in the clinical management of SCA.<sup>[<xref rid=""R11"" ref-type=""bibr"">11</xref>]</sup> This paper aims to fill this critical knowledge gap by presenting a comprehensive review of the prevalence and impact of malnutrition in individuals with SCA. Moreover, it delves into the existing nutritional interventions and strategies for alleviating malnutrition, thereby enhancing the holistic care and well-being of SCA patients. By shedding light on this often-overlooked aspect of the disease, we hope to advocate for greater recognition and improved management of malnutrition in SCA, ultimately contributing to better health outcomes and improved quality of life for those living with this challenging condition. SCA is a hereditary hemoglobinopathy characterized by the production of abnormal hemoglobin, known as hemoglobin S (HbS), instead of normal hemoglobin A. In SCA, the abnormal HbS causes red blood cells to become rigid and assume a sickle shape, leading to hemolysis (destruction of red blood cells). This results in chronic anemia. Anemia increases the body demand for nutrients, particularly iron, as iron is a key component of hemoglobin. Individuals with SCA may require higher dietary iron intake to support increased red blood cell production.<sup>[<xref rid=""R12"" ref-type=""bibr"">12</xref>–<xref rid=""R16"" ref-type=""bibr"">16</xref>]</sup> Inflammation is a common feature of SCA due to ongoing hemolysis, endothelial activation, and ischemia-reperfusion injury. Chronic inflammation can lead to increased energy expenditure and protein turnover. It may be necessary to adjust dietary intake to meet these increased demands, including higher calorie and protein consumption. SCA is associated with higher levels of oxidative stress due to the release of free heme and iron from damaged red blood cells. Antioxidant nutrients such as vitamins C and E may be important to help combat oxidative stress. These nutrients can be obtained from a diet rich in fruits, vegetables, and nuts. Vaso-occlusive crises occur when the abnormally shaped red blood cells obstruct blood vessels, leading to pain, organ damage, and impaired blood flow.<sup>[<xref rid=""R17"" ref-type=""bibr"">17</xref>–<xref rid=""R21"" ref-type=""bibr"">21</xref>]</sup> Proper hydration and maintenance of a balanced diet are essential to support overall health and minimize the risk of dehydration, which can exacerbate vaso-occlusive events. SCA can lead to delayed growth and development in children due to chronic anemia and nutritional deficits. Adequate nutrient intake, especially protein, is crucial for growth and development in children with SCA. Nutritional support and monitoring are essential to ensure normal growth. The increased energy expenditure and nutritional requirements in individuals with SCA result from the combined effects of anemia, inflammation, and hypermetabolism. SCA patients may require a diet that provides additional calories, protein, vitamins, and minerals to meet their heightened metabolic needs. Some SCA patients may have dietary restrictions or preferences based on cultural or medical considerations. It is essential to work with patients to create dietary plans that accommodate their specific needs, taking into account both their nutritional requirements and dietary restrictions.<sup>[<xref rid=""R22"" ref-type=""bibr"">22</xref>–<xref rid=""R26"" ref-type=""bibr"">26</xref>]</sup> Malnutrition in individuals with SCA is a multifaceted concern with significant implications for health and overall well-being.<sup>[<xref rid=""R27"" ref-type=""bibr"">27</xref>]</sup> The chronic anemia associated with SCA leads to an increased demand for nutrients, particularly iron, folate, and vitamin B12. Hemolysis and the turnover of red blood cells necessitate higher dietary intake of these essential nutrients.<sup>[<xref rid=""R28"" ref-type=""bibr"">28</xref>]</sup> Individuals with SCA often experience chronic inflammation due to the ongoing hemolysis, endothelial activation, and ischemia-reperfusion injury. Inflammatory processes can lead to increased energy expenditure and protein turnover, further elevating nutritional requirements.<sup>[<xref rid=""R29"" ref-type=""bibr"">29</xref>]</sup> Pain crises are common in SCA and can result in loss of appetite. During these episodes, individuals may have reduced food intake, which can lead to inadequate nutrition, particularly during acute episodes of vaso-occlusive pain.<sup>[<xref rid=""R30"" ref-type=""bibr"">30</xref>]</sup> Chronic inflammation and gastrointestinal complications can affect nutrient absorption, particularly in the intestines. Malabsorption can lead to deficiencies in essential vitamins and minerals, such as vitamin D, calcium, and magnesium.<sup>[<xref rid=""R29"" ref-type=""bibr"">29</xref>]</sup> Proper hydration is essential for individuals with SCA to maintain blood flow and prevent vaso-occlusive events. Dehydration can exacerbate the risk of vaso-occlusive crises and can lead to further complications. Ensuring adequate fluid intake is a crucial aspect of nutritional management.<sup>[<xref rid=""R31"" ref-type=""bibr"">31</xref>]</sup> Some individuals with SCA may adhere to dietary restrictions based on cultural practices or personal preferences. These restrictions can limit dietary choices and may contribute to nutritional deficits.<sup>[<xref rid=""R32"" ref-type=""bibr"">32</xref>]</sup> Socioeconomic disparities can impact access to nutritious food and healthcare. Lower-income individuals may face barriers to obtaining a balanced and nutrient-rich diet. Children with SCA are at risk of growth and development delays due to chronic anemia and nutritional deficits. Nutritional support and monitoring are essential to ensure normal growth and development.<sup>[<xref rid=""R33"" ref-type=""bibr"">33</xref>]</sup> Nutrient deficiencies can weaken the immune system, increasing the susceptibility to infections. Malnutrition can exacerbate the severity of SCA complications, such as pain crises, acute chest syndrome, and stroke.<sup>[<xref rid=""R34"" ref-type=""bibr"">34</xref>]</sup> Nutritional deficits can impair wound healing and recovery from vaso-occlusive events or surgery. Malnutrition can contribute to fatigue, weakness, and reduced overall quality of life. Nutrient deficiencies can have cognitive and neurological effects, particularly in children, potentially impacting learning and development.<sup>[<xref rid=""R35"" ref-type=""bibr"">35</xref>]</sup> Managing malnutrition in individuals with SCA involves a multidisciplinary approach, including healthcare providers, nutritionists, and the individuals themselves. Nutritional interventions should address specific deficiencies and adapt to the unique needs of each patient, taking into account factors such as age, disease severity, and the presence of specific complications. Regular nutritional assessments, dietary counseling, and supplementation when necessary are important components of managing malnutrition in SCA.<sup>[<xref rid=""R36"" ref-type=""bibr"">36</xref>]</sup> Malnutrition in individuals with SCA can have significant consequences for health outcomes and the incidence of complications. Malnutrition, which may result from nutrient deficiencies or inadequate dietary intake, can exacerbate the severity of the disease and its associated complications.<sup>[<xref rid=""R37"" ref-type=""bibr"">37</xref>]</sup> Malnutrition can lead to a weakened immune system and reduced pain threshold, increasing the likelihood of vaso-occlusive pain crises in SCA patients. These crises are one of the hallmark features of the disease and are often associated with severe pain, hospitalizations, and complications.<sup>[<xref rid=""R38"" ref-type=""bibr"">38</xref>]</sup> Malnourished individuals with SCA may experience longer hospital stays during vaso-occlusive crises due to delayed recovery. Nutrient deficiencies can hinder the body ability to heal and repair damaged tissues, leading to extended hospitalizations and more extensive healthcare costs.<sup>[<xref rid=""R28"" ref-type=""bibr"">28</xref>]</sup> Malnutrition can impede the growth and development of children with SCA. Stunted growth and delayed sexual maturation are common consequences. Delayed development can have long-term effects on the individual overall health and quality of life.<sup>[<xref rid=""R39"" ref-type=""bibr"">39</xref>]</sup> Nutrient deficiencies, especially in essential vitamins and minerals, can weaken the immune system. This makes individuals with SCA more susceptible to infections, including those caused by bacteria and viruses, which can further complicate their health and increase the frequency of hospitalizations.<sup>[<xref rid=""R40"" ref-type=""bibr"">40</xref>]</sup> Nutrient deficiencies, particularly vitamin B12 and folic acid, can lead to neurological complications, such as cognitive impairment and peripheral neuropathy. These complications can affect cognitive function and quality of life.<sup>[<xref rid=""R41"" ref-type=""bibr"">41</xref>]</sup> Malnutrition can contribute to the risk of developing ACS, a potentially life-threatening complication of SCA. ACS is characterized by lung inflammation and is often triggered by infections. Weakened immune function and nutritional deficits can increase the susceptibility to infections that may lead to ACS.<sup>[<xref rid=""R42"" ref-type=""bibr"">42</xref>]</sup> Malnutrition can exacerbate chronic anemia in SCA, leading to fatigue, weakness, and reduced exercise tolerance. This can further limit the patient overall quality of life and may lead to complications such as organ damage.<sup>[<xref rid=""R43"" ref-type=""bibr"">43</xref>]</sup> Malnourished individuals may have a reduced response to treatment interventions, including blood transfusions or medications. Nutritional deficits can hinder the effectiveness of these therapies, making disease management more challenging. Several factors contribute to malnutrition in individuals with SCA, a complex genetic disorder. Understanding these factors is essential for effectively addressing malnutrition in this population. Here are some key contributors to malnutrition in individuals with SCA: The prevalence of malnutrition in individuals with SCA can vary depending on factors such as geographical location, access to healthcare, socioeconomic status, and the specific nutritional status of the affected individuals. While there is no universal prevalence rate for malnutrition in SCA, research and clinical observations have highlighted its significance. The prevalence of malnutrition in SCA can vary widely among different populations and regions. In some areas with a high prevalence of both SCA and malnutrition, the risk may be greater. However, there is no fixed prevalence rate applicable to all SCA patients.<sup>[<xref rid=""R50"" ref-type=""bibr"">50</xref>]</sup> Malnutrition can be particularly common in children and adolescents with SCA. Chronic anemia, growth and developmental delays, and increased nutritional demands during periods of growth make this population more vulnerable to malnutrition.<sup>[<xref rid=""R51"" ref-type=""bibr"">51</xref>]</sup> Malnutrition in SCA may go underdiagnosed because it can be masked by the chronic anemia that is characteristic of the disease. The focus on managing anemia can sometimes overshadow the importance of assessing and addressing malnutrition. While not all individuals with SCA are malnourished, certain nutrient deficiencies, such as low levels of vitamin D, folate, or iron, are frequently observed in this population. The presence of chronic health challenges, such as vaso-occlusive pain crises, frequent infections, and hospitalizations, can contribute to malnutrition. These factors can disrupt normal eating patterns and reduce nutrient intake. The prevalence of malnutrition in SCA can be better understood through screening and monitoring. Regular nutritional assessments and evaluations can help identify individuals at risk and provide opportunities for early intervention.<sup>[<xref rid=""R52"" ref-type=""bibr"">52</xref>]</sup> Nutritional interventions, including dietary counseling, supplementation, and personalized nutrition plans, can help mitigate the effects of malnutrition. However, the success of these interventions may vary among individuals. Cultural dietary practices and preferences can influence nutritional status. Some individuals with SCA may adhere to dietary restrictions or have aversions to specific foods, which can impact their nutritional intake. Malnutrition in individuals with SCA can have a significant impact on their health and well-being. SCA is a complex genetic disorder characterized by chronic anemia and a range of complications, and malnutrition can exacerbate the severity of the disease and its associated challenges.<sup>[<xref rid=""R53"" ref-type=""bibr"">53</xref>]</sup> Malnutrition can weaken the immune system and reduce the pain threshold, leading to an increased frequency of vaso-occlusive pain crises. These crises are characterized by severe pain and can result in frequent hospitalizations and complications.<sup>[<xref rid=""R28"" ref-type=""bibr"">28</xref>]</sup> Malnourished individuals with SCA may experience extended hospital stays during vaso-occlusive crises due to delayed recovery. Nutrient deficiencies can hinder the body ability to heal and repair damaged tissues, leading to prolonged hospitalizations and increased healthcare costs. Malnutrition can impede the growth and development of children with SCA. Stunted growth and delayed sexual maturation are common consequences, affecting the long-term health and quality of life of these individuals.<sup>[<xref rid=""R54"" ref-type=""bibr"">54</xref>]</sup> Nutrient deficiencies, especially in essential vitamins and minerals, can weaken the immune system. Weakened immunity makes individuals with SCA more susceptible to infections, including bacterial and viral infections, which can further complicate their health and lead to frequent hospitalizations.<sup>[<xref rid=""R54"" ref-type=""bibr"">54</xref>]</sup> Malnutrition can lead to neurological complications, particularly in the case of vitamin B12 and folic acid deficiencies. Cognitive impairment and peripheral neuropathy are potential consequences that can impact cognitive function and overall quality of life. Malnutrition can contribute to the risk of developing ACS, a potentially life-threatening complication of SCA. ACS is characterized by lung inflammation and is often triggered by infections. Malnutrition can increase susceptibility to infections that may lead to ACS.<sup>[<xref rid=""R52"" ref-type=""bibr"">52</xref>]</sup> Malnutrition can exacerbate the chronic anemia in SCA, resulting in fatigue, weakness, and reduced exercise tolerance. These effects can limit an individual overall quality of life and may contribute to complications such as organ damage. Malnourished individuals may experience a reduced response to treatment interventions, including blood transfusions or medications. Nutritional deficits can hinder the effectiveness of these therapies, making disease management more challenging.<sup>[<xref rid=""R28"" ref-type=""bibr"">28</xref>]</sup> The impact of malnutrition on individuals with SCA is significant and far-reaching. Addressing malnutrition through proper nutrition, dietary counseling, and nutritional interventions is essential for improving health outcomes and reducing the risk of complications. A multidisciplinary approach involving healthcare providers, nutritionists, and individuals themselves is crucial to managing malnutrition effectively and enhancing overall health and quality of life in the context of SCA. Nutritional interventions play a crucial role in the management of SCA. Individuals with SCA have unique nutritional needs due to chronic anemia, increased energy expenditure, and potential nutrient deficiencies. Proper nutrition can help mitigate the impact of the disease and improve overall health.<sup>[<xref rid=""R55"" ref-type=""bibr"">55</xref>]</sup> Individuals with SCA should receive dietary counseling from registered dietitians or nutritionists who are familiar with the specific nutritional needs of SCA patients. Counseling should include information on maintaining a balanced diet, hydration, and nutrient-rich food choices.<sup>[<xref rid=""R52"" ref-type=""bibr"">52</xref>]</sup> Folate supplementation can help support red blood cell production. SCA patients are often deficient in vitamin D, so supplementation may be recommended. In some cases, iron supplementation may be necessary, but this should be closely monitored, as excessive iron can be harmful in SCA patients.<sup>[<xref rid=""R56"" ref-type=""bibr"">56</xref>]</sup> Adequate hydration is crucial for SCA patients to maintain blood flow and prevent vaso-occlusive events. Patients should be encouraged to drink plenty of fluids, especially during hot weather or when experiencing fever or illness.<sup>[<xref rid=""R57"" ref-type=""bibr"">57</xref>]</sup> A well-balanced diet that includes a variety of nutrient-rich foods is essential. SCA patients should consume a diet that provides adequate calories, protein, vitamins, and minerals. Foods rich in iron, such as lean meats and dark leafy greens, can help support red blood cell production. For individuals who require iron supplementation, it is important to manage iron intake carefully. Excessive iron can lead to iron overload, which can be harmful. Monitoring iron levels through blood tests is essential. Some individuals with SCA may experience pain crises triggered by certain foods, such as those high in sodium or processed foods. Identifying and avoiding trigger foods can help manage pain and complications. Children and adolescents with SCA may require specific nutritional support to ensure normal growth and development. Nutritionists can work with pediatric patients and their families to create age-appropriate meal plans.<sup>[<xref rid=""R58"" ref-type=""bibr"">58</xref>]</sup> Considering cultural dietary practices and preferences is important. Nutrition interventions should be culturally sensitive and respect individual choices and traditions. Regular nutritional assessments and monitoring of nutrient levels are essential to track nutritional status and make necessary adjustments to the dietary plan. Healthcare providers, nutritionists, and patients should work together to develop and implement a personalized nutrition plan that considers the individual age, disease severity, and specific nutritional needs.<sup>[<xref rid=""R59"" ref-type=""bibr"">59</xref>]</sup> Nutritional interventions for SCA should be tailored to the individual needs and may evolve over time. Regular communication with healthcare providers and nutrition experts is essential to ensure that the nutritional plan is effective and well-suited to the changing needs of individuals with SCA. Proper nutrition is an integral part of managing SCA and can significantly impact the health and well-being of those living with the condition.<sup>[<xref rid=""R28"" ref-type=""bibr"">28</xref>]</sup> Addressing malnutrition in individuals with SCA is essential for improving health outcomes, but several challenges and barriers can complicate this process. These challenges may be influenced by factors such as healthcare access, socioeconomic status, cultural considerations, and the complex nature of the disease itself. Limited awareness and understanding of the nutritional needs of individuals with SCA can lead to delayed or inadequate interventions. Healthcare providers, patients, and caregivers may not be fully informed about the importance of nutrition in managing SCA.<sup>[<xref rid=""R60"" ref-type=""bibr"">60</xref>]</sup> Socioeconomic disparities and lack of access to healthcare can impede the ability of individuals with SCA to receive proper nutritional assessments and interventions. Some individuals may face barriers to accessing healthcare resources and expertise. Cultural dietary practices and preferences can influence nutritional choices. Dietary restrictions or aversions based on cultural or personal beliefs can limit the variety of foods available to individuals with SCA, potentially leading to nutritional deficits. Meeting the complex nutritional requirements of individuals with SCA, including addressing chronic anemia and inflammation, can be challenging. Nutritional management may require personalized plans and careful consideration of specific needs.<sup>[<xref rid=""R61"" ref-type=""bibr"">61</xref>]</sup> SCA is associated with chronic pain crises, frequent infections, and hospitalizations. These health challenges can disrupt normal eating patterns, leading to reduced nutrient intake and making it difficult to manage malnutrition.<sup>[<xref rid=""R20"" ref-type=""bibr"">20</xref>]</sup> Some individuals with SCA may experience pain crises triggered by specific foods. Avoiding these foods can lead to dietary restrictions and challenges in maintaining a balanced diet.<sup>[<xref rid=""R62"" ref-type=""bibr"">62</xref>]</sup> Living with SCA can be emotionally and psychologically challenging. Mental health factors, such as depression or anxiety, can affect eating habits and overall well-being, potentially contributing to malnutrition.<sup>[<xref rid=""R63"" ref-type=""bibr"">63</xref>]</sup> In regions with limited resources, individuals with SCA may not have access to nutritional support, such as dietary counseling or nutritional supplements. This lack of resources can hinder effective malnutrition management.<sup>[<xref rid=""R64"" ref-type=""bibr"">64</xref>]</sup> Patient adherence to nutritional recommendations can be a barrier. Individuals may struggle to follow dietary plans or take prescribed supplements consistently, impacting the effectiveness of nutritional interventions. The severity of SCA can vary among individuals. Managing malnutrition in severe cases may be more challenging and require more intensive interventions.<sup>[<xref rid=""R59"" ref-type=""bibr"">59</xref>]</sup> Individuals with sickle cell disease (SCD) often face unique challenges related to their nutritional status, which necessitates the development and utilization of effective nutrition screening tools.<sup>[<xref rid=""R65"" ref-type=""bibr"">65</xref>]</sup> These tools are designed to identify individuals at risk of malnutrition, assess their dietary habits, and guide healthcare professionals in providing targeted interventions. Implementing a nutrition screening tool for both children and adults with SCD is crucial to ensure that their nutritional needs are addressed comprehensively. A robust nutrition screening tool for SCD should encompass various components. It should consider the disease-specific factors such as the frequency and severity of pain crises, medication impact on appetite, and any dietary restrictions associated with the condition. Additionally, assessing general health status, energy levels, and appetite provides insights into overall well-being.<sup>[<xref rid=""R66"" ref-type=""bibr"">66</xref>]</sup> Dietary habits, including hydration, regularity of meals, and intake of essential nutrients, should be thoroughly examined. A comprehensive screening tool must also account for the potential impact of coexisting conditions on nutritional status, acknowledging the complexity of healthcare needs in individuals with SCD.<sup>[<xref rid=""R67"" ref-type=""bibr"">67</xref>]</sup> Given that SCD affects both children and adults, an effective nutrition screening tool should be adaptable across different age groups.<sup>[<xref rid=""R67"" ref-type=""bibr"">67</xref>]</sup> Children may have distinct nutritional requirements due to growth and development, while adults may face challenges related to chronic pain and increased nutrient demands during crises. A tool that considers these age-specific factors ensures a more accurate assessment of nutritional status and facilitates targeted interventions tailored to the unique needs of each population. In children with SCA, growth and development are particularly critical considerations. Nutrition screening tools tailored for pediatric populations should address age-appropriate nutritional requirements, growth patterns, and the potential impact of SCD on developmental milestones. For adults, the emphasis may shift toward managing chronic complications, maintaining a healthy weight, and addressing nutrient deficiencies associated with the disease. The implementation of a nutrition screening tool in the clinical care of individuals with SCD holds promise for improving their overall health outcomes.<sup>[<xref rid=""R68"" ref-type=""bibr"">68</xref>]</sup> Regular screening can lead to early identification of nutritional issues, allowing for timely interventions such as dietary counseling, supplementation, or collaboration with registered dietitians. As research in the field of SCD continues to evolve, future iterations of nutrition screening tools should incorporate advancements in our understanding of the disease and its impact on nutritional status, ensuring that they remain effective in guiding patient care. The nutritional status of individuals with SCD is crucial for managing the overall health and well-being of both children and adults. Various nutrition screening tools have been developed to assess the specific needs and challenges associated with SCD.<sup>[<xref rid=""R69"" ref-type=""bibr"">69</xref>]</sup> One such tool is the Malnutrition Universal Screening Tool (MUST), which is commonly used in diverse populations but may need adaptation for the unique considerations of SCA.<sup>[<xref rid=""R70"" ref-type=""bibr"">70</xref>]</sup> Malnutrition Universal Screening Tool (MUST), or any similar tool, can serve as a valuable asset in identifying individuals at risk of malnutrition in the context of SCD. For children and adults alike, these screening tools typically encompass a range of parameters, including overall health, energy levels, appetite, sickle cell crisis frequency, pain levels, and dietary habits. These tools provide a comprehensive evaluation, considering disease-specific factors such as medication usage, dietary restrictions, and the impact of SCD on nutritional intake.<sup>[<xref rid=""R69"" ref-type=""bibr"">69</xref>]</sup> The management of malnutrition in individuals with SCA is an evolving field with ongoing research and potential future directions. Tailoring nutrition plans to individual SCA patients based on their age, disease severity, and specific nutritional needs is an area that warrants further research. Personalized plans can optimize the management of malnutrition and improve health outcomes.<sup>[<xref rid=""R71"" ref-type=""bibr"">71</xref>]</sup> Research into precision medicine, including genetic and molecular profiling, may provide insights into the specific nutritional requirements of SCA patients. Precision approaches can help identify genetic factors that influence nutrient metabolism and guide personalized nutritional interventions. Studying the interaction between an individual genetic makeup and their response to specific nutrients is an emerging field. Understanding how genetic variations affect nutrient utilization in SCA can lead to more targeted nutritional interventions. The development of innovative dietary supplements, such as fortified foods or micronutrient-rich products, designed specifically for individuals with SCA, could address common nutrient deficiencies and enhance overall nutrition. Leveraging telehealth and telemedicine platforms to provide nutritional counseling and support for individuals with SCA, especially in regions with limited access to healthcare, can be a promising direction. These technologies can improve access to nutritional expertise and ongoing monitoring. Conducting clinical trials and intervention studies to assess the effectiveness of different nutritional approaches in managing malnutrition in SCA is essential. These studies can provide evidence-based guidelines for nutrition interventions. Exploring the impact of behavioral interventions, such as motivational counseling, on dietary adherence and nutritional status can help individuals with SCA develop better eating habits and improve their overall health. The use of telehealth and telemedicine can improve access to nutritional counseling and support for individuals with SCA, especially in regions with limited access to healthcare resources. Developing collaborative care models that involve a multidisciplinary team of healthcare providers, nutritionists, and psychologists can address the complex nutritional and psychosocial needs of individuals with SCA. Implementing global health initiatives to raise awareness and improve the nutritional management of SCA, especially in regions with a high prevalence of the disease, can have a substantial impact on reducing malnutrition. Empowering individuals with SCA and their caregivers through education about the importance of nutrition in disease management and providing them with practical tools to make informed dietary choices. Conducting longitudinal studies to assess the long-term effects of nutritional interventions on health outcomes and complications in individuals with SCA. These future directions represent opportunities to enhance the nutritional management of SCA and improve the overall well-being and quality of life for individuals living with this complex condition. Research, innovation, and collaboration among healthcare professionals, researchers, and patients will continue to shape the field of nutrition in SCA. The management of malnutrition in individuals with SCA is a critical aspect of comprehensive care that cannot be overlooked. Malnutrition, while often underrecognized, exerts a profound impact on the health and well-being of those living with SCA. This publication has shed light on the prevalence of malnutrition, its impact on disease outcomes, and potential interventions. The prevalence of malnutrition in SCA varies, influenced by factors such as geography, healthcare access, and socioeconomic status. However, it is clear that malnutrition affects a substantial portion of the SCA population, especially children and adolescents, and it is associated with a host of complications and challenges. Malnutrition in SCA is not a standalone issue but an interconnected aspect of the complex pathophysiology of the disease. Chronic anemia, inflammation, and hypermetabolism necessitate increased nutritional requirements, while factors such as pain crises, nutrient malabsorption, and dietary restrictions hinder adequate nutrition. The consequences of malnutrition are far-reaching, impacting pain crises, hospitalizations, growth and development, immune function, and overall quality of life. To address malnutrition in SCA, a multifaceted approach is necessary. Nutritional interventions, including dietary counseling, supplementation, and personalized nutrition plans, should be tailored to the specific needs of each individual. Collaborative care involving healthcare providers, nutritionists, and patients is crucial for effective management. Looking ahead, the future of malnutrition management in SCA holds promise. Personalized nutrition plans, precision medicine, innovative dietary supplements, and the integration of telehealth and telemedicine can transform the way we address malnutrition. Behavioral interventions and global health initiatives can further empower individuals with SCA to take charge of their nutritional well-being. <bold>Conceptualization:</bold> Emmanuel Ifeanyi Obeagu. <bold>Methodology:</bold> Emmanuel Ifeanyi Obeagu, Getrude Uzoma Obeagu. <bold>Supervision:</bold> Emmanuel Ifeanyi Obeagu. <bold>Visualization:</bold> Emmanuel Ifeanyi Obeagu. <bold>Writing—original draft:</bold> Emmanuel Ifeanyi Obeagu, Getrude Uzoma Obeagu. <bold>Writing—review & editing:</bold> Emmanuel Ifeanyi Obeagu, Getrude Uzoma Obeagu.",N/A,17 5 2024
Cardiac diastolic maladaptation is associated with the severity of exercise intolerance in sickle cell anemia patients,"This pilot study focusing on Sickle Cell Anemia (SCA) patients offers a comprehensive and integrative evaluation of respiratory, cardiovascular, hemodynamic, and metabolic variables during exercise. Knowing that diastolic dysfunction is frequent in this population, we hypothesize that a lack of cardiac adaptation through exercise might lead to premature increase in blood lactate concentrations in SCA patients, a potential trigger for acute disease complication. SCA patients were prospectively included in PHYSIO-EXDRE study and underwent a comprehensive stress test with a standardized incremental exercise protocol up to 4 mmol L<sup>−1</sup> blood lactate concentration (BL4). Gas exchange, capillary lactate concentration and echocardiography were performed at baseline, during stress test (at ∼ 2 mmol L<sup>−1</sup>) and BL4.

Interestingly, diastolic maladaptation using echocardiography during stress test along with hemoglobin concentration were independently associated to early occurrence of BL4. As BL4 occurs for low-intensity exercises, SCA patients may be subject to acidosis-related complications even during their daily life activities. Beyond assessing physical capacities, our study underlines that diastolic maladaptation during exercise is associated with an early increase in blood lactate concentration.","Sickle cell disease (SCD) is the most common inherited blood disorder in the world<sup><xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR1"">1</xref></sup>. Poor physical capacities are common in patients homozygous for HbS—also called sickle cell anemia (SCA)—as a result of anemia and multiple pulmonary, cardiac, endothelial, muscle, and metabolic dysfunctions<sup><xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR2"">2</xref></sup>. For these patients, elevated pulmonary arterial pressure, diastolic dysfunction, impaired oxygen transport and delivery<sup><xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR3"">3</xref></sup> and early blood lactate accumulation<sup><xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR4"">4</xref>,<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR5"">5</xref></sup> translate into poor adaptation to physical activities. During an exercise of increasing intensity, significant activation of glycogenolysis and glycolysis leads to muscle lactate production, accumulation and subsequently to an increase in blood concentrations<sup><xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR6"">6</xref>,<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR7"">7</xref></sup>. These exercise-related metabolic changes result in a left shift of the blood lactate (vs. work load) curve, with premature occurrence of the first lactate threshold and of the 4 mmol L<sup>−1</sup> blood lactate concentration (BL4). Furthermore, elevation of blood lactate concentrations is accompanied by acidosis<sup><xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR8"">8</xref></sup>. Regarding SCA patients, acidosis is well-known for promoting hemoglobin S (HbS) deoxygenation, increasing the risk of polymerization, potentially inducing red blood cell sickling, and ultimately leading to vaso-occlusive crisis and hemolysis<sup><xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR9"">9</xref></sup>. Therefore, an in-depth analysis of those patients during exercise is crucial to better understand the link between metabolic status and cardiovascular adaptation. Indeed, cardiovascular abnormalities at rest, such as pulmonary hypertension (PH) and diastolic dysfunction, have been identified as the leading cause of mortality and impaired quality of life in SCA patients<sup><xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR10"">10</xref>–<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR14"">14</xref></sup>. These disorders rely on complex mechanisms associating chronic anemia, hemolysis-induced vasculopathy and repeated vaso-occlusive episodes, contributing to a maladaptive cardiovascular remodeling<sup><xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR15"">15</xref>–<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR17"">17</xref></sup>. While the diagnosis of cardiac dysfunction is extremely challenging considering the unique hemodynamic features of SCA, recent studies have reported the potential interest of investigating cardiovascular adaptation during exercise, to dynamically unmask latent heart dysfunction and its association with exercise limitation<sup><xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR18"">18</xref>–<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR20"">20</xref></sup>. However, there is currently no data available on the link between cardiac impairment, premature lactate accumulation and thus the poor physical capacities of SCA patients during stress test. This pilot study is designed to comprehensively evaluate multiple exercise parameters by integrating cardiovascular, hemodynamic, respiratory, and metabolic variables. The main hypothesis of this work is that subclinical cardiac diastolic alterations during exercise might lead to premature increase in blood lactate concentrations, assessed by percentage of theoretical peak oxygen uptake (%<inline-formula id=""IEq8""><alternatives><tex-math id=""M5"">\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}

The secondary objective was to evaluate the safety of the procedure.   In this pilot study, we used an innovative and integrated approach which analyzes simultaneously hemodynamic, cardiac, respiratory, and metabolic parameters during stress test to highlight diastolic cardiac abnormalities linked to premature blood lactate accumulation. To our knowledge, this is the first application of “diastolic stress test” in conjunction with lactate monitoring in SCA patients. Our main findings were: (1) As hypothesized, impaired diastolic adaptation to exercise is independently associated with an early occurrence of BL4, such as low hemoglobin level. (2) Poor physical capacities are observed in all patients, thus reflecting their high vulnerability to exercise. Our protocol of sub-maximal stress test appears safe and feasible despite the severity of SCA patients. This pilot study provides a new understanding of the mechanisms associated with exercise limitation in SCA patients, adding the role of impaired cardiac diastolic function to anemia. Integrative, sub-maximal, lactate driven exercise evaluation could be safely used to stratify the severity of SCA patients by revealing latent heart impairment or significant metabolic vulnerability and could be the starting point for reinforced therapies and rehabilitation programs.

Electrocardiographic Changes and Their Association With Disease Severity in Adults With Sickle Cell Anemia at a Tertiary Care Center: A Cross-Sectional Study,"Introduction Sickle cell anemia (SCA), a severe hematological disorder, is characterized by the presence of sickle-shaped erythrocytes that obstruct capillaries and restrict blood flow. This pathophysiology not only promotes systemic complications but may also influence cardiac function. Cardiac complications are a leading cause of mortality in SCA patients, yet the specific electrocardiographic (ECG) changes associated with disease severity are not thoroughly understood. This cross-sectional study aimed to explore ECG abnormalities in adults with SCA and correlate these findings with disease severity. Methods An observational cross-sectional study was conducted over 18 months, from January 2022 to June 2023, among 140 SCA patients at the Sickle Cell OPD of All India Institute of Medical Sciences, Raipur, Raipur, India. Steady-state SCA (HbS >50%) patients screened by high-performance liquid chromatography were enrolled. A history, physical examination, complete blood count, and ECG were done for all cases. The disease severity score was calculated using the Adegoke and Kuti severity scores, and their association with various ECG changes was studied. The chi-square test (Fisher’s exact test, wherever applicable) was used for comparing the proportion. The correlation was done using the Pearson correlation coefficient or Spearman’s rho. Results Out of 140 patients, the mean age of the study participants was 26 ± 6 years. More than half of the cases (80; 57%) fall under the 18-27 age group, with a male-to-female ratio of 4:3. A total of 99 (70.7%) of the participants had mild disease, and 41 (29.3%) had moderate disease. The QT interval was significantly higher among patients with mild disease compared to those with moderate disease (p-value: <0.01). QTc dispersion and prolonged QTc interval were significantly higher among patients with moderate disease compared to mild disease (p-value <0.01, 0.04, respectively). Sinus tachycardia and right ventricular hypertrophy with p-pulmonale were significantly higher in moderate severity (p < 0.01). A significant positive correlation was observed between QTc dispersion, P-wave dispersion, and severity (r: 0.19, 0.17; p-value: 0.02, 0.04, respectively). Conclusion As the disease severity progressed, the ECG changes studied had a higher distribution and significance. ECG is a readily and widely accessible investigation that can be used to screen all SCA patients for early recognition of various underlying cardiac complications.","Sickle cell disease (SCD) falls under the category of hemoglobinopathies that include mutations in the gene encoding the beta subunit of hemoglobin. The sickle cell mutation resulting in the production of abnormal hemoglobin occurs when negatively charged glutamine is replaced by a neutral valine at the sixth position of the beta-globin chain (point mutation). This mutation is transmitted via Mendelian genetics and is inherited in an autosomal recessive fashion. A homozygous mutation leads to the severest form of SCD, i.e., sickle cell anemia (SCA), also called HBSS disease [<xref rid=""REF1"" ref-type=""bibr"">1</xref>]. SCA is ubiquitous in the tribal belts of Chhattisgarh, Odisha, Madhya Pradesh, and Maharashtra. The frequency of sickle cell trait in India is 4.3%. In Odisha and Chhattisgarh, the frequency of SCA is approximately 9% and 10%, respectively. According to the previous study done in Chhattisgarh, sickle cell trait occurred in 9.30% and an SS phenotype in 0.21% [<xref rid=""REF2"" ref-type=""bibr"">2</xref>]. The basic pathophysiology of SCA is based on deoxy-HbS polymerization and the production of long fibers within RBCs, resulting in a distorted sickle shape, which leads to enhanced hemolysis and sickle red cell vaso-occlusion [<xref rid=""REF3"" ref-type=""bibr"">3</xref>]. Adults with SCA experience a variety of symptoms. The effects of recurrent hemolysis, anemia, and ischemia-reperfusion injury on multiple organs, including the heart, are responsible for these symptoms. These factors determine the severity of the illness. Recent work has shown the importance of red cell dehydration, abnormal RBC adhesion to the vascular endothelium, inflammatory events, activation of cells in the vessel, and abnormalities of nitric oxide metabolism in the pathophysiology of this multi-organ disease [<xref rid=""REF3"" ref-type=""bibr"">3</xref>]. Diagnosis of SCA can be based on clinical background, and diagnosis can be supported by lab parameters like a complete blood count and peripheral blood smear [<xref rid=""REF4"" ref-type=""bibr"">4</xref>,<xref rid=""REF5"" ref-type=""bibr"">5</xref>]. The diagnosis in developing countries is mostly confirmed by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) techniques, while in resourceful settings, it is also confirmed by various genetic testing techniques like PCR-based techniques, restriction fragment length polymorphism, DNA microarrays, and sequencing techniques [<xref rid=""REF6"" ref-type=""bibr"">6</xref>-<xref rid=""REF11"" ref-type=""bibr"">11</xref>]. As significant proportions of SCA patients survive into adulthood due to improved healthcare services, it is known that cardiovascular comorbidities contribute significantly to the complications of SCA and contribute to mortality [<xref rid=""REF12"" ref-type=""bibr"">12</xref>]. Electrocardiography (ECG) is an affordable and relatively accessible, noninvasive procedure used to assess cardiac structure and function. Several studies have observed abnormal electrocardiograms in SCA patients. These studies have documented abnormalities such as tachycardia, left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH), left atrial fibrillation, right ventricular hypertrophy (RVH), nonspecific changes of the ST segment and T-wave, arrhythmias (such as ventricular premature complexes and atrial enlargement), prolonged corrected QT intervals, and first-degree atrioventricular block. When compared to normal controls, SCA participants also showed significantly greater mean heart rate, P-wave duration, P-wave dispersion, PR interval, QRS duration, QRS dispersion, QTc interval, and QTc dispersion [<xref rid=""REF13"" ref-type=""bibr"">13</xref>]. These changes are observed secondary to increased cardiac output to compensate for the chronic anemia seen in SCA. There is a high output state, and the resulting cardiomegaly increases the preload. The increased preload and decreased afterload compensate for the left ventricular dysfunction and maintain a normal ejection fraction and high cardiac output. Holloman et al. reported that in the ECGs of 87 adult patients, 63 (72%) of all patients had abnormal ECGs. Nonspecific ST-T (NS ST-T) wave abnormalities 46 (53%) and QT interval prolongation 11 (12%) were frequent. A total of 10 (11%) had sinus tachycardia, and eight (80%) of those were women. Moreover, 15 of 21 (71%) patients with arrhythmias had NS ST-T abnormalities. Systemic hypertension and ECG evidence for right-sided heart disease were rare, as was the incidence of LVH by ECG [<xref rid=""REF14"" ref-type=""bibr"">14</xref>]. Ahmed et al. reported that the estimated mean left ventricle ejection fraction was 61.29 ± 11.29% (range 20-76%) [<xref rid=""REF12"" ref-type=""bibr"">12</xref>]. Eight (21%) patients had evidence of a hyperdynamic left ventricle (ejection fraction >70%). Left heart abnormalities included a dilated atrium in 14 (37%), a dilated ventricle in five (13%), ventricle hypertrophy in five (13%), and ventricle dysfunction in three (9%) patients. Right heart abnormalities included a dilated atrium in nine (24%), a dilated ventricle in six (16%), and ventricle dysfunction in three (9%) patients. Moreover, one of these three patients had evidence of biventricular failure, and all three patients with right ventricular dysfunction had moderate to severe pulmonary hypertension. Dosunmu et al. study showed 68 of 93 (73.1%) had abnormal ECG, while only two of 90 (2.2%) of controls had abnormal ECG. The common abnormalities observed were LVH, biventricular hypertrophy, and RVH [<xref rid=""REF15"" ref-type=""bibr"">15</xref>]. Oguanobi et al. showed the mean heart rate, P-wave duration, P-wave dispersion, PR interval, QRS duration, QRS dispersion, QTc interval, and QTc dispersion were significantly higher in the patients than in the control group. ECG abnormalities identified by this study were LVH (75% versus 1.7%), left atrial enlargement (40% versus 0%), biventricular hypertrophy (11% versus 0%), ST-segment elevation (10% versus 0%), and increased P-wave and QTc dispersions [<xref rid=""REF16"" ref-type=""bibr"">16</xref>,<xref rid=""REF17"" ref-type=""bibr"">17</xref>]. The cardiovascular manifestations of SCA include cardiomegaly, cardiac failure, cardiomyopathies, diastolic dysfunction, pulmonary hypertension, etc. ECG is an affordable, relatively accessible, and noninvasive assessment method. Different scoring systems have been used to assess the severity of the disease. Evaluation of disease severity in patients with SCA will help identify patients at higher risk for an adverse clinical course who may need more active management and monitoring. There have been several studies regarding the different ECG changes in SCA patients, and some studies have determined the disease severity based on genetic factors and phenotypic expression of the disease, such as the frequency of crises and hospital admissions, the degree of anemia, the frequency of blood transfusions, and the presence of complications. However, very little research has been done that correlates ECG changes with the disease severity of SCA. This was a cross-sectional study conducted over 18 months, from January 2022 to June 2023, at Sickle Cell OPD, All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS), Raipur, Raipur, India. This study was approved by our institute’s ethical committee with approval number AIIMS/RPR/IEC/2022/1145. A total of 140 SCA patients who satisfied the inclusion and exclusion criteria were enrolled in the study after obtaining informed consent. Table <xref rid=""TAB1"" ref-type=""table"">1</xref> shows the inclusion and exclusion criteria for the study. Methodology Screening was done with HPLC reports. Only SS cases were enrolled (HbS window >50%). Steady-state SCA patients attending sickle cell OPD were recruited as per inclusion and exclusion criteria. Informed written consent for participation was obtained. A thorough clinical history and examination were done. The disease severity score was calculated for each case using the Adegoke and Kuti severity scoring system in Table <xref rid=""TAB2"" ref-type=""table"">2</xref> [<xref rid=""REF18"" ref-type=""bibr"">18</xref>]. ECG changes were recorded manually: rate, rhythm, axis, P-wave duration, P-wave dispersion, PR interval, QRS duration, dispersion, QT interval, QTc interval, QTc dispersion, ST segment, T waves, and others. All the relevant data was stored in a Microsoft Excel master chart (Microsoft Corporation, Redmond, Washington, United States). The data was entered into a computer-based spreadsheet and cleaned. The cleaned data were analyzed using IBM SPSS Statistics for Windows, Version 25.0 (Released 2017; IBM Corp., Armonk, NY, USA). The Kolmogorov-Smirnov test was used to assess the normality of the statistical analysis comprised of calculating the mean, median, and proportions. The chi-square test (Fisher’s exact test, wherever applicable) was used for comparing the proportion. A student t-test (Mann-Whitney U test, wherever applicable) was used for comparing continuous variables. The correlation was done using the Pearson correlation coefficient or Spearman’s rho. The level of significance was taken as p < 0.05. As it was an observational cross-sectional study, data values were gathered from routine blood tests and ECG only, which were available at AIIMS Raipur. So, this study had nil risk to the participants. A total of 140 patients were enrolled in the study. The mean age of the study participants was 26.52 ± 6.71 years. Eighty (57%) of the participants were male, and the rest (60; 43%) were female, with a male-to-female ratio of 4:3. The mean HbS% among the study participants was 66.80 ± 8.02. As shown in Figure <xref rid=""FIG1"" ref-type=""fig"">1</xref>, 99 (70.7%) of the participants had mild disease, and 41 (29.3%) had moderate disease. No severe disease study participant was found in the study. Figure <xref rid=""FIG2"" ref-type=""fig"">2</xref> shows the ECG findings of the study participants. The predominant ECG finding was sinus tachycardia (21 cases; 15.7%), followed by LVH (12 cases; 8.6%), sinus arrhythmia (nine cases; 6.4%), sinus bradycardia (five cases; 3.6%), RVH with p-pulmonale (five cases; 3.6%), benign early repolarization (four cases; 2.9%), left anterior fascicular block (LAFB) (three cases; 2.1%), and right bundle branch block (RBBB) (three cases; 2.1%). Table <xref rid=""TAB3"" ref-type=""table"">3</xref> shows the mean P-wave duration, P-wave dispersion, PR interval, QRS duration, QRS dispersion, QT interval, QTc interval, and QTc dispersion were 94.74 ± 17.72, 43.85 ± 14.32, 142.76 ± 22.29, 88.46 ± 11.83, 43.79 ± 10.5, 368.56 ± 38.41, 423.89 ± 26.86, and 40.86 ± 16.18 ms, respectively. As shown in Figure <xref rid=""FIG3"" ref-type=""fig"">3</xref>, the association between severity and QTc interval indicates that prolonged QTc intervals were significantly higher among study participants with moderate severity (p-value: 0.04). Table <xref rid=""TAB4"" ref-type=""table"">4</xref> shows the association between severity and QT interval (ms) among the study participants. The QT interval was significantly higher among patients with mild disease compared to those with moderate disease (p-value: <0.01). Table <xref rid=""TAB5"" ref-type=""table"">5</xref> shows the association between severity and QTc dispersion (ms) among the study participants. QTc dispersion was significantly higher among patients with moderate disease compared to mild disease (p-value: <0.01). Table <xref rid=""TAB6"" ref-type=""table"">6</xref> shows the association between severity and other ECG findings. Sinus tachycardia and RVH with p-pulmonales were significantly higher in moderate severity (p <0.01). Table <xref rid=""TAB7"" ref-type=""table"">7</xref>, Figure <xref rid=""FIG4"" ref-type=""fig"">4</xref>, and Figure <xref rid=""FIG5"" ref-type=""fig"">5</xref> show the correlation between ECG indices and disease severity scores. A significant positive correlation was observed between QTc dispersion and severity (r: 0.19; p-value: 0.02). Also, a significant positive correlation was observed between P-wave dispersion and severity (r: 0.17; p-value: 0.04). Out of 140 patients, the mean age of the study participants was 26 ± 6 years. More than half of the cases (80; 57%) fall within the 18-27 age group. Eighty (57.1%) of the participants were males, and the rest, 60 (42.9%), were females. Similar distribution characteristics were found in a study conducted by Mbakamma et al. in 2019 among 53 SCA patients, which showed that 68% of cases and 64% of controls were within the 18-27 age group (range 18-45) [<xref rid=""REF19"" ref-type=""bibr"">19</xref>]. The recurring crises that cause early reporting before the body develops compensatory mechanisms might account for the younger mean population found in multiple studies. The mean HbS% among the study participants was 66.80 ± 8.02. Also, mean HbS was significantly (p < 0.01) higher among patients with moderate disease (71.28 ± 6.95) compared to mild disease (64.95 ± 7.72). There are hardly any studies comparing the HbS with disease severity, particularly utilizing the Adegoke and Kuti scoring system that we have used in our present study. This could be because of the nonavailability of HPLC reports readily during the study period, multiple HbS values for the same patient interfered with by transfusions, and also due to a nondefinite scoring system for SCA. However, there are studies on fetal hemoglobin’s association with SCA. One such cross-sectional study by Adeodu et al. from Nigeria reported that homozygous sickle cell patients aged 1-15 with moderate disease and potentially fatal complications had significantly lower HbF levels [<xref rid=""REF20"" ref-type=""bibr"">20</xref>]. A total of 99 (70.7%) of the participants had mild disease, 41 (29.3%) had moderate disease, and 0% had severe disease, according to the scoring system used in the study, which is inclusive of all the abovementioned parameters. The most common score was zero, followed by three, one, and eight. The mean severity score among the study participants was 4.76 ± 3.83, with a median (IQR) of 4 (2-8). There was no significant association between the mean age of the study participants or their gender (p = 0.49 and 0.87, respectively). A similar study conducted by Dic-Ijiewere et al. among 120 South Nigerian sickle cell cases in 2021 showed 23%, 65%, and 12% of total cases falling under mild, moderate, and severe disease, respectively, with a mean score of 14.5 ± 4.04 [<xref rid=""REF13"" ref-type=""bibr"">13</xref>]. There was no significant association between severity grade and age groups or gender in the study. The lack of cases in the severe disease category of our study could be due to the exclusion of non-steady-state sickle cell patients who required admission or had recent crises. The exclusion is also justified by the fact that the ECG changes could be affected by confounding factors during the peri-crisis state and might not reveal changes attributable to only the disease severity of an individual. In our study, the mean heart rate among the study participants was 85 ± 17 beats per minute. The majority of the study participants had a heart rate between 60 and 100 beats per minute. Moreover, five (3.6%) and 22 (15.7%) of the participants had sinus bradycardia and sinus tachycardia, respectively. Most of the study participants had normal axes. Only 11 (7.9%) and five (3.6%) had left and right axis deviations, respectively. The left axis deviation was secondary to LVH or LAFB, while the right axis deviation was secondary to RBBB or RVH. The mean P-wave duration, P-wave dispersion, PR interval, QRS duration, QRS dispersion, QT interval, QTc interval, and QTc dispersion were 94.74 ± 17.72, 43.85 ± 14.32, 142.76 ± 22.29, 88.46 ± 11.83, 43.79 ± 10.5, 368.56 ± 38.41, 423.89 ± 26.86, and 40.86 ± 16.18 ms, respectively. The QT interval was significantly higher among patients with mild disease compared to those with moderate disease (p-value: <0.01). Although it was statistically significant among the mild disease category, this could also be an apparent association because QT interval is affected by various factors like heart rate, drugs, electrolyte disturbances, myocardial ischemia, hypothermia, etc. However, it was also observed in our study that prolonged QTc interval and QTc dispersion were significantly higher among patients with moderate disease compared to those with mild disease (p-value: 0.04; <0.01, respectively). It is to be noted that QTc is heart rate independent, unlike QT. QTc dispersion also indicates the risk of probable ventricular arrhythmias leading to sudden cardiac deaths and can predict mortality in patients with underlying cardiac dysfunction or even in healthy individuals. Our study lacked a control population against which the variables mentioned above could be compared. However, similar observations were seen in previous studies. A descriptive cross-sectional study among 60 SCA cases by Oguanobi et al. showed a significant prolongation of dispersion indices (P-wave dispersion, QRS dispersion, and QTc dispersion) among SCA patients and even higher dispersions among SCA patients with pulmonary hypertension [<xref rid=""REF16"" ref-type=""bibr"">16</xref>]. Dic-Ijiewere et al. reported that as the severity of SCA increased, mean P-wave duration, P-wave dispersion, QRS dispersion, QTc interval, and QTc dispersion also increased. For QTc interval and QTc dispersion, these changes were statistically significant (p = 0.003 and p = 0.002, respectively) [<xref rid=""REF13"" ref-type=""bibr"">13</xref>]. These observations raise suspicion about the metabolic cause of these dispersions secondary to hypoxia or toxins (hyperbilirubinemias). The most common ECG finding in our study was sinus tachycardia (21), followed by LVH (12), sinus arrhythmia (nine), sinus bradycardia (five), RVH with p. pulmonates (five), benign early repolarization (four), LAFB (three), and RBBB (three). Among all these findings, sinus tachycardia and RVH with p-pulmonales were significantly higher with moderate disease severity (p <0.01). Sinus tachycardia could be explained by hypoxia-stimulated chemoreceptors and increased sympathetic activity secondary to anemia. Chronic anemia leads to compensatory LVH. RVH with p-pulmonales was secondary to pulmonary hypertension, the most classic cardiac complication seen in SCA patients. As our study included only steady-state SCA patients, it can be asserted that including severe disease patients or cases with multiple crises would accentuate the findings, uncovering a broader population at risk of various cardiac complications.  A retrospective study by Sant'Ana PG et al. in Brazil reported that among 50 SCA cases, 21 patients (42%) were hospitalized mainly for painful crises, and 20 patients (40%) received blood transfusions [<xref rid=""REF21"" ref-type=""bibr"">21</xref>]. A case-control study (93 steady-state SCA cases and 90 controls) by Dosunmu et al. in Lagos, Nigeria reported that 73% of the cases had abnormal ECGs, and among these, the common abnormalities observed were LVH, biventricular hypertrophy, and RVH [<xref rid=""REF15"" ref-type=""bibr"">15</xref>]. A retrospective observational study conducted by Ahmed et al. showed significantly (p = 0.01) higher pulmonary arterial systolic pressure (43.2 ± 0.5) among patients with low Hb (<8 g/dl) as compared to patients with Hb >/= 8 g/dl [<xref rid=""REF12"" ref-type=""bibr"">12</xref>]. Our study also determined if there was any correlation between the various ECG changes and disease severity. Among all the parameters studied, a significant positive correlation was observed between QTc dispersion and severity (r: 0.19; p-value: 0.02). Also, a significant positive correlation was observed between P-wave dispersion and severity (r = 0.17; p = 0.04). This positive correlation also reiterates the fact that as the disease severity progresses, the risk of atrial and ventricular arrhythmias also increases, as indicated by the P-wave and QTc dispersion, respectively. Although there are studies available on determining different ECG changes in SCA patients, very few studies have correlated these changes with disease severity. This could largely be due to the lack of a universal scoring system for SCA. One such study conducted by Dic-Ijiewere et al. showed that there was a significant positive correlation between the SCA severity scores and P-wave duration, P-wave dispersion, QRS dispersion, QTc interval, and QTc dispersion (r: 0.32; p: 0.01; r: 0.27; p: 0.03; r: 0.29; p: 0.02; r: 0.33; p: 0.01; and r: 0.34; p: 0.007, respectively), suggesting a higher risk of left atrial abnormalities, intraventricular conduction abnormalities, increased risk of arrhythmias, and sudden death as disease severity progresses [<xref rid=""REF13"" ref-type=""bibr"">13</xref>]. Limitations Only steady-state sickle patients from OPD were included in the study, not the ones with active or recent crises. As it was a cross-sectional study, there was no follow-up to study the ECG changes and their relation to disease severity. Consequently, the validity of the changes observed and the correlation studied cannot be determined due to the uncertainty of the persistence of outcomes in the long term. Patients were not followed up with a 2D echo for confirmation of the changes studied. The study lacked a control group against which the outcomes could be compared. As the study was conducted in a tertiary care center, the outcomes cannot be extrapolated to the much broader sickle cell population, especially where SCD is endemic in a state like Chhattisgarh. Among all the ECG parameters studied, QTc dispersion, prolonged QTc interval, sinus tachycardia, and RVH with p-pulmonales were significantly higher in the moderate disease category. A significant positive correlation was observed for P and QTc dispersions with disease severity. ECG is a readily and widely accessible investigation that can be used to screen all SCA patients for early recognition of various underlying cardiac complications.",N/A,13 5 2024

In this era of precision medicine, where unraveling the molecular complexities of diseases is paramount, a focused exploration of eosinophilic dialogues in SCA not only adds depth to our understanding but also presents novel opportunities for therapeutic innovation. This review aims to synthesize existing knowledge, identify knowledge gaps, and stimulate further inquiry into the molecular dimensions of SCA severity orchestrated by eosinophilic dialogues. The aim of the review titled “Eosinophilic Dialogues: A Molecular Exploration of Sickle Cell Anemia Severity” is to comprehensively investigate and analyze the molecular interactions and implications of eosinophils in the context of SCA severity. By examining current literature, the review aims to elucidate the roles of eosinophils in the pathophysiology of SCA and explore potential therapeutic targets that may influence disease severity. This review seeks to contribute valuable insights to the existing knowledge base, fostering a deeper understanding of the molecular mechanisms involving eosinophils in SCA progression. Eosinophils, traditionally recognized as pivotal components of the immune system’s response to parasitic infections and allergic reactions, have recently emerged as intriguing contributors to the complex pathophysiology of SCA<sup><xref rid=""R5"" ref-type=""bibr"">5</xref></sup>. Understanding the fundamental biology and functions of eosinophils is crucial for unraveling their enigmatic roles in influencing the severity of SCA. Eosinophils, derived from hematopoietic stem cells, undergo a complex process of differentiation and maturation within the bone marrow. Upon maturation, eosinophils undergo activation in response to various stimuli. Eosinophils exert diverse effector functions, ranging from phagocytosis and degranulation to the release of inflammatory mediators. Beyond their well-established effector functions, eosinophils possess immunomodulatory roles that extend to the regulation of other immune cells and inflammatory responses.

Epigenetic modifications, such as DNA methylation, histone modifications, and non-coding RNA regulation, provide an additional layer of complexity to eosinophil regulation<sup><xref rid=""R10"" ref-type=""bibr"">10</xref></sup>. Surface markers are critical indicators of eosinophil activation and functional states. The cytokine and chemokine milieu profoundly influences eosinophil recruitment, activation, and survival. Eosinophil metabolism is a dynamic aspect of their functionality, and alterations in metabolic pathways may signify dysregulation. In SCA, eosinophils, typically associated with immune responses, have emerged as potential orchestrators of inflammation and oxidative stress, contributing to the intricate pathophysiology of the disease<sup><xref rid=""R11"" ref-type=""bibr"">11</xref></sup>. Eosinophils, once activated, release an array of inflammatory mediators that influence the surrounding microenvironment. Eosinophils are renowned producers of reactive oxygen species (ROS), and their dysregulated activation can tip the balance towards oxidative stress<sup><xref rid=""R12"" ref-type=""bibr"">12</xref></sup>. Eosinophils contribute to inflammation through the formation of extracellular traps, a process traditionally associated with neutrophils.

Future studies could leverage these technologies to unravel patient-specific molecular signatures, paving the way for precision medicine approaches tailored to individual needs. Conducting longitudinal studies to track the dynamic changes in eosinophil behavior and molecular profiles over time in individuals with SCA is crucial. Eosinophils exhibit functional diversity, and future research should delve into the specific roles of distinct eosinophil subpopulations in SCA. Elucidating how different subsets contribute to inflammation, oxidative stress, and vascular complications could refine our understanding of their impact on disease severity. Systems biology approaches that consider the intricate interplay between various cellular components could provide a holistic view of the molecular landscape in SCA. Future research should strive to integrate systems biology methodologies to capture the complex network interactions involved in eosinophilic dialogues. Translating molecular findings into clinically relevant outcomes is a critical challenge. Bridging the gap between bench research and bedside applications necessitates a concerted effort to validate molecular targets and interventions in clinical settings, ultimately improving patient outcomes. The inherent variability in the response to eosinophilic contributions among individuals with SCA poses a significant challenge. Future research should aim to unravel the factors contributing to this variability, including genetic, environmental, and epigenetic influences, to guide personalized therapeutic strategies. Ethical considerations in research involving vulnerable populations, such as individuals with SCA, need careful attention. Ensuring inclusivity and fair representation in clinical trials and research studies is imperative to avoid disparities in access to emerging therapeutic interventions. Overcoming the challenges in understanding eosinophilic dialogues requires collaborative efforts and data sharing. Establishing international consortia and collaborative initiatives could facilitate the pooling of data and resources, accelerating progress in the field. This paper on eosinophilic dialogues in SCA has unveiled a molecular odyssey, illuminating the intricate interplay between eosinophils and the pathophysiology of this complex hematological disorder. The molecular exploration of eosinophilic dialogues in SCA represents a milestone in understanding the intricate tapestry of this disease.

Managing gastrointestinal challenges: Diarrhea in sickle cell anemia,"Sickle cell anemia (SCA), a hereditary hemoglobinopathy, is characterized by the presence of abnormal hemoglobin and has long been associated with a wide range of complications. While much attention has been given to the condition hematological aspects, gastrointestinal complications, particularly diarrhea, have been relatively understudied and often overlooked. This publication delves into the management of gastrointestinal challenges, with a focus on diarrhea, in individuals living with SCA. The pathophysiology of SCA is intrinsically linked to gastrointestinal complications, and diarrhea is a common manifestation of this condition. This abstract publication outlines the key elements discussed in the full-length work, which includes the clinical presentation of diarrhea in these patients, the diagnostic tools used to evaluate the condition, and various management strategies to alleviate symptoms and enhance the overall quality of life for affected individuals. The paper emphasizes the importance of patient education, offering healthcare professionals valuable insights into how to inform and support patients in managing their conditions effectively. It also highlights the need for continued research to further our understanding of gastrointestinal challenges in SCA and to identify potential areas for future therapeutic interventions. Ultimately, the comprehensive management of diarrhea in individuals with SCA is vital for their overall well-being. This publication serves as a valuable resource for healthcare providers, researchers, and caregivers in addressing the gastrointestinal challenges that accompany SCA, ultimately working toward a better quality of life for those affected by this condition.","Sickle cell anemia (SCA) poses a myriad of challenges for those affected, and among the complications, gastrointestinal issues, particularly diarrhea, emerge as significant concerns. SCA is a hereditary blood disorder characterized by the presence of abnormal hemoglobin, leading to the formation of sickle-shaped red blood cells. Individuals with SCA often face complications such as vaso-occlusive crises and organ damage due to the impaired flow of blood. Gastrointestinal manifestations, including diarrhea, can exacerbate the overall health burden on individuals with SCA. Understanding and managing these challenges are essential components of comprehensive healthcare for individuals grappling with SCA, highlighting the need for specialized attention to gastrointestinal symptoms.<sup>[<xref rid=""R1"" ref-type=""bibr"">1</xref>–<xref rid=""R3"" ref-type=""bibr"">3</xref>]</sup> Effectively addressing diarrhea in individuals with SCA requires a multifaceted approach that considers the unique aspects of the disorder. Gastrointestinal symptoms in SCA can result from various factors, such as infection, medications, or complications from vaso-occlusive crises. A tailored management strategy involves not only treating acute symptoms but also implementing preventive measures and promoting overall digestive health. This may include hydration strategies, dietary modifications, and close monitoring to detect and manage potential complications promptly. Moreover, healthcare providers must collaborate with individuals with SCA to develop personalized care plans that address the specific challenges posed by gastrointestinal symptoms, aiming for improved overall quality of life and better disease management.<sup>[<xref rid=""R1"" ref-type=""bibr"">1</xref>]</sup> Sickle cell disease (SCD) is a condition affecting the entire body; the underlying reason for the manifestations would be blockage of the vessels by the sickled cells with added inflammation or infections. The attending physician who treats this underlying disease, along with preventive measures like avoiding dehydration and electrolyte imbalance, would automatically address the underlying mechanism. The general management of SCD holds good even for the gastrointestinal findings. The order in which organ systems are involved in the order of priority has to be considered. Managing gastrointestinal challenges, such as diarrhea, in individuals with SCA presents a unique set of considerations and concerns.<sup>[<xref rid=""R1"" ref-type=""bibr"">1</xref>]</sup> SCA is a genetic blood disorder that affects the shape and function of red blood cells, leading to various complications.<sup>[<xref rid=""R2"" ref-type=""bibr"">2</xref>]</sup> While the primary focus of SCA management is often on preventing and managing vaso-occlusive crises and pain, gastrointestinal issues like diarrhea can also significantly impact the quality of life for those living with this condition.<sup>[<xref rid=""R3"" ref-type=""bibr"">3</xref>]</sup> SCA is a hereditary disorder characterized by the presence of abnormal hemoglobin, which causes red blood cells to become rigid and take on a crescent or sickle shape.<sup>[<xref rid=""R4"" ref-type=""bibr"">4</xref>]</sup> This abnormal shape can obstruct blood vessels, leading to a wide range of complications, including pain crises, anemia, and organ damage. Diarrhea is a common gastrointestinal symptom in individuals with SCA.<sup>[<xref rid=""R4"" ref-type=""bibr"">4</xref>]</sup> The exact cause of diarrhea in sickle cell patients can vary, but it may be related to factors like medications, infections, or the disease itself.<sup>[<xref rid=""R5"" ref-type=""bibr"">5</xref>,<xref rid=""R6"" ref-type=""bibr"">6</xref>]</sup> Diarrhea can lead to dehydration, electrolyte imbalances, and further complications in people with SCA.<sup>[<xref rid=""R7"" ref-type=""bibr"">7</xref>]</sup> Dehydration can exacerbate the risk of vaso-occlusive crises and other complications associated with the disease.<sup>[<xref rid=""R8"" ref-type=""bibr"">8</xref>]</sup> Managing diarrhea in individuals with SCA requires a multifaceted approach.<sup>[<xref rid=""R9"" ref-type=""bibr"">9</xref>]</sup> Proper hydration is crucial. Patients should drink plenty of fluids to prevent dehydration. In some cases, intravenous fluids may be necessary, especially if dehydration is severe. Maintaining a well-balanced diet is essential. A registered dietitian can help design a diet plan that meets the patient nutritional needs while considering any dietary restrictions or sensitivities. In some cases, antidiarrheal medications or medications to address the underlying cause of diarrhea may be prescribed under a healthcare provider guidance. Managing pain associated with diarrhea or sickle cell crises is important.<sup>[<xref rid=""R10"" ref-type=""bibr"">10</xref>,<xref rid=""R11"" ref-type=""bibr"">11</xref>]</sup> Appropriate pain medications and pain management strategies should be part of the treatment plan. Preventing diarrhea in sickle cell patients involves maintaining overall health and minimizing triggers.<sup>[<xref rid=""R12"" ref-type=""bibr"">12</xref>]</sup> This may include avoiding certain foods or medications that can exacerbate gastrointestinal symptoms and managing stress, which can be a trigger for sickle cell crises. Individuals with SCA should have regular checkups with a healthcare provider who is experienced in managing the condition.<sup>[<xref rid=""R13"" ref-type=""bibr"">13</xref>]</sup> This helps ensure early detection and management of any complications, including gastrointestinal issues. Educating individuals with SCA and their caregivers about the importance of proper hydration, nutrition, and recognizing the signs of dehydration and complications is essential for effective self-management.<sup>[<xref rid=""R14"" ref-type=""bibr"">14</xref>]</sup> Managing diarrhea in individuals with SCA requires a comprehensive and multidisciplinary approach.<sup>[<xref rid=""R15"" ref-type=""bibr"">15</xref>]</sup> Proper hydration, nutrition, and pain management are crucial components of care, and individuals living with this condition should work closely with healthcare providers to address their unique needs and challenges. The pathophysiology of gastrointestinal challenges, including diarrhea, in SCA is complex and multifactorial.<sup>[<xref rid=""R16"" ref-type=""bibr"">16</xref>]</sup> It primarily stems from the fundamental genetic mutation that characterizes SCD, leading to the formation of abnormal hemoglobin, known as hemoglobin S (HbS). In SCA, individuals inherit 2 abnormal HbS genes. Under conditions of low oxygen or dehydration, HbS molecules tend to polymerize, forming long, rigid structures within the red blood cells.<sup>[<xref rid=""R17"" ref-type=""bibr"">17</xref>–<xref rid=""R20"" ref-type=""bibr"">20</xref>]</sup> This results in the characteristic “sickling” of red blood cells, which leads to their altered shape and decreased flexibility. Sickled red blood cells have a tendency to adhere to the endothelial lining of blood vessels, leading to vaso-occlusion. These clumps of sickled cells can block small blood vessels, impairing blood flow to various tissues and organs, including the gastrointestinal tract. The reduced blood flow can cause ischemia (lack of oxygen) and damage to the intestines.<sup>[<xref rid=""R21"" ref-type=""bibr"">21</xref>–<xref rid=""R25"" ref-type=""bibr"">25</xref>]</sup> The vaso-occlusive events in the gastrointestinal tract trigger an inflammatory response.<sup>[<xref rid=""R26"" ref-type=""bibr"">26</xref>]</sup> Ischemia, a reduced blood supply, can lead to tissue damage and increased permeability of the intestinal wall. This can result in leakage of blood and protein into the intestines and the secretion of pro-inflammatory mediators. Endothelial cells lining the blood vessels can also be damaged by the adherence of sickled red blood cells. This endothelial injury can further contribute to inflammation, vasoconstriction, and compromised blood flow. SCA may also disrupt the balance of the gut microbiome, which can influence the gut function.<sup>[<xref rid=""R27"" ref-type=""bibr"">27</xref>]</sup> Changes in the gut microbiota may contribute to gastrointestinal symptoms, including diarrhea. In cases where vaso-occlusion episodes resolve, the subsequent reperfusion of previously ischemic tissues can lead to additional tissue damage due to the release of reactive oxygen species and inflammatory mediators.<sup>[<xref rid=""R28"" ref-type=""bibr"">28</xref>]</sup> SCA can lead to autonomic nervous system dysregulation, which may affect the motility and function of the gastrointestinal tract.<sup>[<xref rid=""R29"" ref-type=""bibr"">29</xref>]</sup> This can result in delayed transit times and altered bowel habits, including diarrhea. Individuals with SCA may be more susceptible to infections and enteric pathogens due to immune system compromise.<sup>[<xref rid=""R30"" ref-type=""bibr"">30</xref>]</sup> Infections and inflammatory responses to these pathogens can trigger or exacerbate gastrointestinal symptoms, including diarrhea.<sup>[<xref rid=""R31"" ref-type=""bibr"">31</xref>]</sup> It is important to note that the severity and frequency of gastrointestinal complications, including diarrhea, can vary among individuals with SCA.<sup>[<xref rid=""R32"" ref-type=""bibr"">32</xref>]</sup> Table <xref rid=""T1"" ref-type=""table"">1</xref> shows causes of diarrhea in SCA, Table <xref rid=""T2"" ref-type=""table"">2</xref> shows underlying mechanisms of diarrhea in SCA, Table <xref rid=""T3"" ref-type=""table"">3</xref> shows diagnosis of diarrhea in SCA and Table <xref rid=""T4"" ref-type=""table"">4</xref> shows management of diarrhea in SCA (author provided). The clinical presentation of gastrointestinal challenges, particularly diarrhea, in individuals with SCA can vary in severity and frequency.<sup>[<xref rid=""R33"" ref-type=""bibr"">33</xref>]</sup> These challenges often result from the complex pathophysiological processes that affect the gastrointestinal tract. Diarrhea in SCA can be intermittent or chronic. Some individuals may experience occasional episodes, while others may have persistent diarrhea.<sup>[<xref rid=""R34"" ref-type=""bibr"">34</xref>]</sup> The severity can range from mild to severe. Diarrhea in SCA typically presents with loose or watery stools. The consistency of stools may vary, and they may be accompanied by an increased urgency to have a bowel movement. Many individuals with SCA experience abdominal pain in conjunction with diarrhea.<sup>[<xref rid=""R35"" ref-type=""bibr"">35</xref>]</sup> The pain can range from mild discomfort to severe cramping and may be localized or diffuse. Some patients may complain of abdominal bloating and increased gas production along with diarrhea. In severe cases, diarrhea in SCA can lead to gastrointestinal bleeding, which may result in the passage of blood in the stools (hematochezia).<sup>[<xref rid=""R36"" ref-type=""bibr"">36</xref>]</sup> Chronic and severe diarrhea can lead to malabsorption of nutrients, resulting in weight loss and malnutrition. Frequent or severe diarrhea episodes can lead to dehydration, which may manifest with symptoms such as dry mouth, increased thirst, reduced urine output, and lethargy. Diarrhea can have a significant impact on the overall quality of life for individuals with SCA, affecting daily activities and social functioning.<sup>[<xref rid=""R37"" ref-type=""bibr"">37</xref>]</sup> It important to note that while diarrhea is a common gastrointestinal symptom in SCA, it can also be caused by other factors, such as infections, medications, or dietary choices. Therefore, a thorough evaluation by a healthcare professional is necessary to determine the specific cause and appropriate management. Diarrhea in SCA should not be ignored, as it can lead to complications such as malnutrition, electrolyte imbalances, and further exacerbation of the underlying disease.<sup>[<xref rid=""R38"" ref-type=""bibr"">38</xref>]</sup> Effective management strategies, as well as patient education, are crucial to address this aspect of the disease and improve the well-being of affected individuals. The diagnosis and evaluation of diarrhea in individuals with SCA involve a comprehensive approach to identify the underlying causes and determine appropriate management strategies.<sup>[<xref rid=""R39"" ref-type=""bibr"">39</xref>]</sup> Begin with a thorough medical history and physical examination to assess the patient overall health, SCA status, and any other relevant medical conditions. Document the frequency, duration, and severity of diarrhea episodes.<sup>[<xref rid=""R40"" ref-type=""bibr"">40</xref>]</sup> Inquire about associated symptoms such as abdominal pain, bloating, and blood in stools. Perform routine blood tests, including a complete blood count, to assess hemoglobin levels and any potential anemia. Check for evidence of inflammation with tests like C-reactive protein or erythrocyte sedimentation rate. Evaluate electrolyte imbalances, particularly potassium and magnesium levels, which can be affected by chronic diarrhea. Conduct stool tests to assess for infection or inflammation. This may include tests for bacterial, viral, or parasitic pathogens, as well as fecal calprotectin, a marker of intestinal inflammation. Consider endoscopic procedures such as colonoscopy or upper endoscopy to visualize and assess the gastrointestinal tract directly. These procedures can help identify structural abnormalities, bleeding sources, or inflammatory conditions. If indicated, use imaging studies like abdominal ultrasound, computed tomography (CT) scans, or magnetic resonance imaging to identify anatomical issues in the gastrointestinal tract. In cases where endoscopic procedures are performed, biopsies of the intestinal tissue can be taken to assess for histopathological changes, including inflammation, ulcers, or other abnormalities. Assess gastrointestinal motility through specialized studies if delayed transit times or motility issues are suspected. Consider genetic testing to confirm the diagnosis of SCA and assess the specific mutations present in the HBB gene. Depending on the findings, consult with specialists such as gastroenterologists, hematologists, or nutritionists to provide expertise in managing gastrointestinal and hematological aspects.<sup>[<xref rid=""R41"" ref-type=""bibr"">41</xref>]</sup> Educate the patient about the nature of SCA and its gastrointestinal complications, emphasizing the importance of hydration and proper dietary choices.<sup>[<xref rid=""R42"" ref-type=""bibr"">42</xref>]</sup> Develop a personalized treatment plan based on the identified causes of diarrhea. This may include dietary modifications, medication to manage symptoms, and addressing any underlying issues. Diarrhea in individuals with SCA can result from a combination of factors, including the disease itself, infections, dietary choices, and medications.<sup>[<xref rid=""R43"" ref-type=""bibr"">43</xref>]</sup> The diagnostic and evaluation process aims to uncover the specific contributors to diarrhea, allowing for a more targeted and effective management strategy. Close collaboration among healthcare professionals is often required to address the complex nature of this condition. When evaluating diarrhea in individuals with SCA, it important to consider a broad range of potential causes, as not all cases of diarrhea are directly related to the underlying condition. Vaso-occlusive crises can lead to ischemia in the gut, causing abdominal pain and diarrhea.<sup>[<xref rid=""R44"" ref-type=""bibr"">44</xref>]</sup> Differentiating this from other causes of diarrhea is important. Gastrointestinal infections, such as viral, bacterial, or parasitic infections, can cause acute diarrhea. SCA patients may be more susceptible to infections due to compromised immunity. Some medications used in the treatment of SCA, such as hydroxyurea or pain management drugs, can have gastrointestinal side effects, including diarrhea.<sup>[<xref rid=""R45"" ref-type=""bibr"">45</xref>]</sup> Dietary choices, food intolerances, or allergies can lead to gastrointestinal symptoms, including diarrhea. Malabsorption of specific nutrients may occur, contributing to diarrhea. Conditions like Crohn disease and ulcerative colitis can present with chronic diarrhea and abdominal pain. They may coexist with SCA. IBS is characterized by abdominal pain, changes in bowel habits, and diarrhea. It can be triggered or exacerbated by stress, which is a common experience in individuals with SCA. Celiac disease, an autoimmune condition triggered by gluten consumption, can lead to chronic diarrhea and malabsorption of nutrients. Various medications unrelated to SCA can lead to diarrhea as a side effect, such as antibiotics, laxatives, and some antihypertensive drugs.<sup>[<xref rid=""R46"" ref-type=""bibr"">46</xref>]</sup> Lactose intolerance can cause diarrhea in individuals who cannot digest lactose, a sugar found in milk and dairy products. Conditions like peptic ulcers, esophagitis, or vascular malformations can lead to gastrointestinal bleeding, which may result in bloody stools and diarrhea. Conditions like pancreatic insufficiency, celiac disease, or short bowel syndrome can result in malabsorption of nutrients and diarrhea. Ingesting toxic substances, such as certain chemicals or spoiled food, can lead to acute diarrhea. Autoimmune disorders, such as systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), can affect the gastrointestinal tract and cause diarrhea.<sup>[<xref rid=""R47"" ref-type=""bibr"">47</xref>]</sup> Conditions like hyperthyroidism or diabetes can lead to changes in bowel habits, including diarrhea. Psychological factors, including stress and anxiety, can exacerbate gastrointestinal symptoms, including diarrhea.<sup>[<xref rid=""R48"" ref-type=""bibr"">48</xref>]</sup> To determine the specific cause of diarrhea in individuals with SCA, a comprehensive evaluation is necessary.<sup>[<xref rid=""R49"" ref-type=""bibr"">49</xref>]</sup> This may include a thorough medical history, physical examination, laboratory tests, imaging, endoscopic procedures, and consultation with specialists. Differential diagnosis is crucial to provide appropriate and effective management tailored to the underlying cause of diarrhea. Managing diarrhea in individuals with SCA involves a multifaceted approach that addresses both the underlying disease and the specific causes of diarrhea.<sup>[<xref rid=""R50"" ref-type=""bibr"">50</xref>]</sup> Adequate hydration is crucial to prevent dehydration, which can exacerbate the symptoms of diarrhea. Encourage increased fluid intake. Monitor and correct electrolyte imbalances, particularly potassium and magnesium, which can be lost due to diarrhea. Work with a registered dietitian to develop a dietary plan that is tailored to the individual needs. In some cases, a low-fiber or lactose-free diet may be recommended. Avoid triggering foods or beverages, such as caffeine, spicy foods, and high-fiber items that may exacerbate diarrhea. Antidiarrheal medications, such as loperamide (Imodium), may be prescribed to help control diarrhea.<sup>[<xref rid=""R51"" ref-type=""bibr"">51</xref>]</sup> However, their use should be carefully monitored by a healthcare professional. Probiotics or prebiotics may be considered to help restore and maintain a healthy gut microbiome. Ensure that the underlying SCA is well-managed.<sup>[<xref rid=""R52"" ref-type=""bibr"">52</xref>]</sup> This may involve regular blood transfusions, hydroxyurea therapy, or other disease-modifying treatments as prescribed by a hematologist. Promptly identify and treat any infections that may be causing or exacerbating diarrhea. This includes using appropriate antibiotics or antiviral medications. Manage sickle cell-related pain effectively, as uncontrolled pain can exacerbate gastrointestinal symptoms.<sup>[<xref rid=""R42"" ref-type=""bibr"">42</xref>]</sup> Pain medications should be used as prescribed. Provide resources and support for individuals to manage stress and anxiety, as these emotional factors can influence gastrointestinal symptoms. Educate the patient about their condition and the importance of managing diarrhea. Encourage lifestyle modifications, including stress reduction, regular exercise, and adequate sleep. Schedule regular follow-up appointments with healthcare providers to monitor the effectiveness of the management plan, assess for complications, and make any necessary adjustments. Offer psychological support and counseling for individuals dealing with the physical and emotional challenges of SCA and its associated symptoms, including diarrhea.<sup>[<xref rid=""R53"" ref-type=""bibr"">53</xref>]</sup> In cases of severe complications, such as intestinal infarction or intractable bleeding, surgical intervention may be necessary. This may include partial bowel resection or other procedures. It is important to note that the management of diarrhea in SCA should be individualized based on the specific needs and causes of diarrhea for each patient.<sup>[<xref rid=""R10"" ref-type=""bibr"">10</xref>]</sup> Healthcare professionals, including hematologists and gastroenterologists, should collaborate to develop and implement a comprehensive and tailored treatment plan.<sup>[<xref rid=""R54"" ref-type=""bibr"">54</xref>]</sup> Regular communication between the patient and their healthcare team is essential to monitor progress and adjust the management strategies as needed.<sup>[<xref rid=""R55"" ref-type=""bibr"">55</xref>]</sup> Diarrhea in individuals with SCA can lead to various complications and is influenced by specific risk factors.<sup>[<xref rid=""R16"" ref-type=""bibr"">16</xref>]</sup> Understanding these complications and risk factors is crucial for the effective management of this condition. Chronic or severe diarrhea can result in dehydration due to excessive fluid loss. Dehydration can lead to symptoms such as dry mouth, increased thirst, reduced urine output, and, in severe cases, electrolyte imbalances.<sup>[<xref rid=""R56"" ref-type=""bibr"">56</xref>]</sup> Prolonged diarrhea can cause malabsorption of essential nutrients, including proteins, vitamins, and minerals. This can result in malnutrition, weight loss, and weakness. Diarrhea can lead to the loss of electrolytes, particularly potassium and magnesium. Electrolyte imbalances can have various health implications, including cardiac arrhythmias. Malabsorption associated with chronic diarrhea may lead to specific nutrient deficiencies, such as iron-deficiency anemia or vitamin deficiencies.<sup>[<xref rid=""R57"" ref-type=""bibr"">57</xref>]</sup> Diarrhea, especially if it causes dehydration or electrolyte imbalances, can exacerbate the underlying SCA, potentially leading to vaso-occlusive crises, pain, and other complications related to the disease.<sup>[<xref rid=""R58"" ref-type=""bibr"">58</xref>]</sup> Chronic diarrhea may increase the risk of gastrointestinal infections, which can further complicate the clinical picture and worsen the symptoms. The specific genotype of SCD (HbSS, HbSC, HbSβ0-thalassemia, etc) can influence the severity and frequency of gastrointestinal complications, including diarrhea. Psychological factors, such as stress and anxiety, can trigger or exacerbate gastrointestinal symptoms, including diarrhea. Diet plays a significant role in the development of diarrhea. Foods that are poorly tolerated, high in fiber, or have known gastrointestinal irritants may contribute to diarrhea. Some medications used in the management of SCA, such as hydroxyurea or pain medications, can have gastrointestinal side effects, including diarrhea. Infections, particularly viral or bacterial infections, can trigger or worsen diarrhea in individuals with SCA.<sup>[<xref rid=""R45"" ref-type=""bibr"">45</xref>]</sup> Their compromised immune system can make them more susceptible to infections. Ongoing inflammation within the gastrointestinal tract, often due to repeated vaso-occlusive crises and ischemia, can contribute to the development of diarrhea.<sup>[<xref rid=""R59"" ref-type=""bibr"">59</xref>]</sup> Poor nutritional status, including malnutrition, can increase the risk of developing diarrhea and worsen its consequences. It essential to conduct a comprehensive evaluation to determine the specific causes of diarrhea in individuals with SCA and identify any underlying risk factors.<sup>[<xref rid=""R60"" ref-type=""bibr"">60</xref>]</sup> Tailored management strategies should address both the underlying disease and the specific contributing factors to minimize complications and improve the individual quality of life. Regular follow-up and communication with healthcare providers are critical to monitor and adjust the management plan as needed. Patient education is a vital component of managing diarrhea in individuals with SCA.<sup>[<xref rid=""R61"" ref-type=""bibr"">61</xref>]</sup> Proper education can empower patients to understand their condition, make informed choices, and actively participate in their healthcare. Explain the basics of SCA, including its genetic nature and the impact on red blood cells and blood circulation.<sup>[<xref rid=""R62"" ref-type=""bibr"">62</xref>]</sup> Discuss the gastrointestinal complications associated with SCA, emphasizing that diarrhea is a common symptom. Help patients recognize the signs of diarrhea, including changes in stool frequency, consistency, and associated symptoms like abdominal pain or bloating. Describe the potential causes of diarrhea in SCA, including the disease itself, infections, medications, stress, dietary choices, and other risk factors.<sup>[<xref rid=""R36"" ref-type=""bibr"">36</xref>]</sup> Stress the importance of maintaining good hydration to prevent dehydration, especially when experiencing diarrhea. Encourage regular fluid intake and consider the use of oral rehydration solutions as needed. Provide dietary recommendations, such as a balanced and fiber-appropriate diet, and suggest avoiding foods or beverages that may exacerbate diarrhea. Explain the use of antidiarrheal medications if prescribed and the importance of using them as directed. Emphasize the necessity of regular follow-up appointments with healthcare providers to monitor symptoms, adjust the management plan, and address any complications. Discuss stress reduction techniques, as stress can trigger or worsen gastrointestinal symptoms. Educate patients on infection prevention strategies, such as practicing good hand hygiene and avoiding contact with sick individuals.<sup>[<xref rid=""R63"" ref-type=""bibr"">63</xref>]</sup> Stress the importance of adhering to the prescribed medications for SCA management and pain control.<sup>[<xref rid=""R64"" ref-type=""bibr"">64</xref>]</sup> If necessary, involve a registered dietitian to provide guidance on maintaining proper nutrition and addressing dietary intolerances. Educate patients on recognizing signs of severe complications and when to seek immediate medical attention, such as for signs of intestinal infarction. Highlight the availability of psychological support services to help patients cope with the emotional aspects of living with SCA and its associated symptoms.<sup>[<xref rid=""R65"" ref-type=""bibr"">65</xref>]</sup> Reinforce the goal of improving the patient overall quality of life and well-being by effectively managing their symptoms. Stress the importance of individualized care, as the causes and severity of diarrhea can vary among individuals with SCA. Patient education should be an ongoing process, and healthcare providers should encourage open communication with patients to address their questions and concerns. Additionally, patient education materials, support groups, and counseling services can be valuable resources to enhance the patient understanding of their condition and its management. Diarrhea in individuals with SCA can result from various factors, including infections, altered gut microbiota, and medication side effects. Probiotics, live microorganisms with potential health benefits, have gained attention for their role in promoting gastrointestinal health. In the context of SCA-related diarrhea, exploring the use of probiotics as a complementary approach is of interest. Probiotics may offer several potential benefits in managing diarrhea in individuals with SCA. SCA-related complications and frequent healthcare interventions can disrupt the balance of gut bacteria. Probiotics may aid in restoring healthy gut microbiota, potentially reducing the frequency and severity of diarrhea episodes. Probiotics have immunomodulatory properties, which may help regulate the immune response in the gastrointestinal tract. This can be beneficial in addressing inflammatory processes contributing to diarrhea in SCA. By promoting a balanced and diverse gut microbiota, probiotics may help prevent or reduce the impact of infectious causes of diarrhea, a common concern in individuals with compromised immune systems such as those with SCA. Before incorporating probiotics into the treatment plan, individuals with SCA should consult their healthcare providers. Probiotics may interact with medications or other treatments, and personalized advice is essential. Different probiotic strains may have varying effects. Research on specific strains’ efficacy in addressing SCA-related diarrhea is limited, emphasizing the need for more targeted studies to establish optimal recommendations. Continuous monitoring of symptoms and an individualized approach to probiotic use are crucial. Adjustments to the probiotic regimen may be necessary based on the individual response and evolving health status.<sup>[<xref rid=""R63"" ref-type=""bibr"">63</xref>,<xref rid=""R64"" ref-type=""bibr"">64</xref>]</sup> Research into diarrhea and its management in individuals with SCA is an evolving field, and ongoing studies aim to improve our understanding of the condition and develop more effective treatment strategies.<sup>[<xref rid=""R46"" ref-type=""bibr"">46</xref>,<xref rid=""R66"" ref-type=""bibr"">66</xref>]</sup> Further research is needed to better understand the underlying mechanisms responsible for diarrhea in individuals with SCA. This includes investigating the role of sickling, inflammation, and other factors contributing to gastrointestinal complications. Exploring genetic and molecular markers associated with the severity and frequency of gastrointestinal symptoms in different genotypes of SCA can help personalize treatment approaches.<sup>[<xref rid=""R67"" ref-type=""bibr"">67</xref>]</sup> The development of specific biomarkers for diagnosing and monitoring gastrointestinal complications can improve early intervention and treatment. Research should focus on the development of targeted therapies that address the specific causes of diarrhea in SCA, such as drugs that can reduce inflammation or enhance intestinal motility. Investigating the role of probiotics and their impact on the gut microbiome in individuals with SCA can provide insights into managing gastrointestinal symptoms. Conducting well-designed clinical trials to evaluate the efficacy and safety of new medications or interventions for managing diarrhea in SCA. Collecting patient-reported outcomes and quality-of-life data to understand the impact of diarrhea on individuals with SCA and to guide the development of patient-centered interventions.<sup>[<xref rid=""R68"" ref-type=""bibr"">68</xref>]</sup> Studying strategies to prevent gastrointestinal complications, such as the use of hydroxyurea, regular blood transfusions, or other disease-modifying therapies, can help reduce the frequency and severity of diarrhea.

"Plasma free hemoglobin is associated with LDH, AST, total bilirubin, reticulocyte count, and the hemolysis score in patients with sickle cell anemia","Plasma free hemoglobin (PFH) is a direct biomarker for hemolysis that has been associated with clinical complications such as pulmonary hypertension and death in patients with sickle cell disease (SCD). We sought to characterize the relationship between PFH and more clinically available hemolytic markers including lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), bilirubin, reticulocyte percentage and to derive a composite hemolysis score derived from principal component analysis (PCA) of these biomarkers. In 68 adult patients (median age 31 years old, IQR 25–39) with HbSS or HbSβ<sup>0</sup>-thalassemia enrolled in the IMPROVE II study, median PFH was elevated at 21.9 mg/dL (IQR 9.9–44.9 mg/dL). Using Pearson correlation analysis, PFH had a stronger relationship to LDH (R=0.699), AST (R=0.587), and total bilirubin (R=0.475), compared to reticulocyte count (R=0.316). The hemolysis score was significantly associated with PFH (R=0.677). When compared with other laboratory measures, PFH correlated with hemoglobin (R= −0.275) and HbS (R=0.277),but did not correlate with white blood cell count (WBC) or HbF. The hemolysis score was significantly associated with WBC (R=0.307), hemoglobin (R = −0.393), HbF (R=− 0.424), and HbS (R=0.423). This study confirms that the conventional hemolytic biomarkers LDH, AST, bilirubin, and reticulocyte percentage correlate with PFH. Additionally, the hemolysis score is a valid tool to measure hemolysis and that it may be a marker of global hemolysis as opposed to PFH, which quantifies intravascular hemolysis. Further studies will be needed to elucidate the role of PFH and intravascular hemolysis in the development of clinical complications of sickle cell disease.","Sickle cell disease (SCD) is an inherited blood disorder characterized by vaso-occlusion, hemolysis, and chronic inflammation [<xref rid=""R1"" ref-type=""bibr"">1</xref>]. In patients with SCD, the degree of hemolysis is associated with complications of various organs including the lungs, brain, and kidneys [<xref rid=""R2"" ref-type=""bibr"">2</xref>,<xref rid=""R3"" ref-type=""bibr"">3</xref>]. Markers of hemolysis have been shown to increase during pain crises [<xref rid=""R4"" ref-type=""bibr"">4</xref>] and be improved in response to sickle cell therapies such as chronic transfusions [<xref rid=""R5"" ref-type=""bibr"">5</xref>]. Furthermore, sickle cell patients with more chronic hemolysis have been found to be at increased risk for devastating sequelae including pulmonary hypertension, priapism, leg ulcers, vaso-occlusive crises (VOC), and death [<xref rid=""R6"" ref-type=""bibr"">6</xref>–<xref rid=""R8"" ref-type=""bibr"">8</xref>]. Thus, it is important to characterize the degree of hemolysis to better risk stratify sickle cell patients and monitor for complications and response to therapy over time. Plasma free hemoglobin (PFH) is one of the most specific biomarkers of intravascular hemolysis [<xref rid=""R9"" ref-type=""bibr"">9</xref>]. Free hemoglobin is released when a red blood cell hemolyzes. Free heme can cause oxidative damage, contributing to the development of the complications above [<xref rid=""R6"" ref-type=""bibr"">6</xref>]. The downside of this test is that its turnaround time is on the order of days, limiting its clinical utility for prompt decision making. Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), bilirubin, and reticulocyte percentage are other biomarkers that are indirect surrogates of hemolysis but are more readily available and often used to estimate hemolysis in patients with SCD [<xref rid=""R6"" ref-type=""bibr"">6</xref>]. The relationship between PFH and other hemolytic markers in SCD has not been well established. Kato et al [<xref rid=""R10"" ref-type=""bibr"">10</xref>] demonstrated that PFH is associated with LDH in SCD but there have been no other studies evaluating the relationship between PFH and AST, bilirubin, and reticulocyte percentage. It is important to confirm that these biomarkers are all correlated to PFH and the strength of these associations. A composite index called the hemolysis score, which is derived from principal component analysis of LDH, AST, total bilirubin, and reticulocyte percentage has been previously validated as a surrogate to estimate the degree of hemolysis in patients with SCD [<xref rid=""R11"" ref-type=""bibr"">11</xref>]. Because LDH, AST, bilirubin, and reticulocyte percentage are indirect markers of hemolysis that can be affected by other factors, the hemolysis score is a useful index that incorporates all four hemolytic biomarkers and accounts for as much of the variance as possible. There has been only one study to our knowledge to evaluate the relationship between PFH and the hemolysis score. Nouraie et al showed that PFH was significantly higher in the highest hemolysis score quartile when compared to that of the lowest quartile [<xref rid=""R2"" ref-type=""bibr"">2</xref>]. Although this paper established the differences in the highest and lowest quartiles of the hemolysis score, it did not describe the distribution and relationship to PFH in the other quartiles. Given the lack of data in this area, we sought to investigate PFH and its relationship with clinically available biomarkers (LDH, AST, total bilirubin, indirect bilirubin, reticulocyte percentage, and absolute reticulocyte count) and the hemolysis score derived from a combination of these biomarkers in patients with sickle cell. Data from the IMPROVE II study [<xref rid=""R12"" ref-type=""bibr"">12</xref>] were used. IMPROVE II was a randomized, placebo-controlled, single-center interventional trial at our institution. Patients with SCD without asthma were randomized to receive either mometasone furoate 220 mcg or placebo inhaled powder for 48 weeks. Patients were adults (age ≥18 years old) confirmed to have either HbSS or HbSβ -thalassemia. The protocol was approved by our center’s institutional review board. Baseline laboratory testing at the first visit prior to intervention was used in the current study. Pearson correlation analysis was used to evaluate the relationship between PFH and the variables AST, LDH, reticulocyte percent (retic), and total bilirubin (Tbili). Absolute reticulocyte count (ARC) and indirect bilirubin were also analyzed. The hemolysis score was derived from the first component of the principal component analysis (PCA) of the log-standardized values of AST, LDH, retic, and Tbili using the SPSS software package [<xref rid=""R13"" ref-type=""bibr"">13</xref>]. PCA of all four variables, as well as combinations of two or three variables, were derived. These hemolysis scores were then compared to PFH using Pearson correlation analysis. Pearson correlation coefficients were calculated to compare PFH and hemolysis to other laboratory data associated with disease severity including white blood cell (WBC) count, hemoglobin (Hgb), hemoglobin F (HbF) and hemoglobin S (HbS) percentages. PFH and the hemolysis score was stratified by hydroxyurea use. Medians were compared using the Mann-Whitney U test. There were 68 sickle cell patients with complete, steady-state laboratory data, 89.7% of whom were HbSS and 10.3% of whom were HbSβ -thalassemia. Demographics of the patients are in <xref rid=""T1"" ref-type=""table"">Table 1</xref>. The median age was 31 years old (IQR 25–39). The median PFH was 21.9 mg/dL (IQR 9.9–44.9 mg/dL). Median values of each variable AST, LDH, total bilirubin, indirect bilirubin, reticulocyte percentage, and absolute reticulocyte count were higher than the normal range (<xref rid=""T1"" ref-type=""table"">Table 1</xref>). To evaluate the relationship between PFH and other markers of hemolysis, each variable was compared to PFH (<xref rid=""T2"" ref-type=""table"">Table 2</xref> and <xref rid=""F1"" ref-type=""fig"">Figure 1</xref>). PFH was significantly associated with LDH (R=0.699, p<0.001), AST (R=0.587, p<0.001), total bilirubin (R=0.475, p<0.001), and reticulocyte count (R=0.316, p=0.010). Indirect bilirubin was evaluated and was also associated with PFH (R=0.454, p<0.001). ARC did not correlate with PFH (R=0.241, p=0.051). The hemolysis score was derived from the first component of PCA of the four variables AST, LDH, Tbili, and reticulocyte. This first component explained 60.0% of the total variance among the four variables in the sample. This hemolysis score was significantly associated with PFH with an R-value of 0.677, p<0.001. PCA of various combinations of three variables were evaluated. The hemolysis score that most strongly correlated with PFH was derived from two variables - AST and LDH (R = 0.709, p<0.001). The relationship between PFH or the hemolysis score and other laboratory features was examined (<xref rid=""T3"" ref-type=""table"">Table 3</xref> and <xref rid=""F2"" ref-type=""fig"">Figure 2</xref>). PFH correlated with hemoglobin (R= −0.275, p=0.023) and HbS (R=0.277, p=0.023), but did not correlate with WBC or HbF. The hemolysis score was associated with WBC (R=0.307, p=0.012), hemoglobin (R = −0.393, p=0.001), HbF (R= −0.424, p<0.001), and HbS (R=0.423, p<0.001). PFH and the hemolysis score were stratified by hydroxyurea status (<xref rid=""F3"" ref-type=""fig"">Figure 3</xref>). Patients taking hydroxyurea had lower PFH compared to patients not taking hydroxyurea (17.4mg/dL vs 28.8mg/dL, respectively), however, this did not reach statistical significance (p=0.092). The hemolysis score was lower in the hydroxyurea group compared to the non-hydroxyurea group (−0.08 vs 0.81, respectively), however, this difference was statistically significant (p=0.003). We sought to evaluate the relationship between PFH and other, more easily and quickly obtainable markers of hemolysis. LDH is associated with PFH in patients with sickle cell disease [<xref rid=""R10"" ref-type=""bibr"">10</xref>], however, the relationship between PFH and the other biomarkers has not been established. Our study demonstrated that AST, LDH, total bilirubin, indirect bilirubin, and reticulocyte count correlated with PFH in patients with SCD. PFH is thought to be a direct biomarker of intravascular hemolysis as it is released from the cell during the process [<xref rid=""R9"" ref-type=""bibr"">9</xref>]. During intravascular hemolysis, a red blood cell releases hemoglobin, LDH, and AST [<xref rid=""R6"" ref-type=""bibr"">6</xref>]. Our findings support this model of intravascular hemolysis. It is important to note that there are limitations as AST, LDH, and bilirubin are indirect markers of hemolysis and can be affected by other events and conditions outside of hemolysis. LDH can be elevated in other conditions with tissue injury [<xref rid=""R14"" ref-type=""bibr"">14</xref>] and AST can be affected by muscle and liver injury [<xref rid=""R15"" ref-type=""bibr"">15</xref>]. Thus, both LDH and AST are not specific to hemolysis. Bilirubin is also a nonspecific surrogate marker for hemolysis as it is the converted form of free heme and can also be affected by liver or biliary disease [<xref rid=""R16"" ref-type=""bibr"">16</xref>,<xref rid=""R6"" ref-type=""bibr"">6</xref>]. Elevated PFH has been linked with sickle cell complications including pulmonary hypertension, cerebral vasculopathy, and increased risk of death [<xref rid=""R17"" ref-type=""bibr"">17</xref>,<xref rid=""R18"" ref-type=""bibr"">18</xref>,<xref rid=""R5"" ref-type=""bibr"">5</xref>], making it a clinically important biomarker to study. PFH is also easier to measure than other direct markers of hemolysis such as RBC survival [<xref rid=""R19"" ref-type=""bibr"">19</xref>]. To our knowledge, this is the first study quantifying the direct relationship between PFH and AST, bilirubin, and reticulocyte count in patients with SCD. Interestingly, reticulocyte count had a weaker correlation with PFH compared to the other hemolytic markers (AST, LDH, bilirubin). In SCD, both extravascular and intravascular hemolysis occur, and it is thought that one-third of hemolysis in patients with SCD is thought to be intravascular [<xref rid=""R20"" ref-type=""bibr"">20</xref>]. Reticulocyte count is considered one of the most robust markers of hemolysis as it is reflective of red cell production, which increases during intravascular as well as extravascular hemolysis [<xref rid=""R16"" ref-type=""bibr"">16</xref>]. PFH, which is a marker of only intravascular hemolysis, may not reflect the total extent of hemolysis [<xref rid=""R6"" ref-type=""bibr"">6</xref>]. This likely explains why PFH does not correlate as strongly to reticulocyte count as it does not reflect extravascular hemolysis. The hemolysis score derived in our study incorporated LDH, AST, bilirubin, and reticulocyte levels and thus may capture both intravascular as well as extravascular hemolysis. In research and clinical care, it can be useful to consolidate multiple, collinear markers of hemolysis into a single score. We found that the hemolysis score correlated with PFH. Our 4-variable hemolytic score PCA yielded a primary component which explained a similar proportion of the total variance to the hemolytic components in the literature (64.1% in our study vs 51–67% in other studies) [<xref rid=""R13"" ref-type=""bibr"">13</xref>,<xref rid=""R11"" ref-type=""bibr"">11</xref>,<xref rid=""R21"" ref-type=""bibr"">21</xref>,<xref rid=""R22"" ref-type=""bibr"">22</xref>,<xref rid=""R2"" ref-type=""bibr"">2</xref>,<xref rid=""R23"" ref-type=""bibr"">23</xref>,<xref rid=""R24"" ref-type=""bibr"">24</xref>]. The study done by Nouraie et al is the only paper to our knowledge to evaluate the relationship between PFH and hemolysis score (derived from AST, LDH, Tbili, reticulocyte count), which support our findings [<xref rid=""R2"" ref-type=""bibr"">2</xref>]. The authors showed that cell-free hemoglobin was higher in the highest quartile of their derived hemolytic score when compared to the lowest quartile. However, it was unclear how the hemolysis score compared to PFH in the other quartiles. Our study used all hemolysis score values and found that they correlated to PFH, which was not known previously. In evaluating the relationship between hemolysis and other laboratory features, we found that PFH was only associated with lower hemoglobin and higher HbS. Hydroxyurea use was associated with a lower PFH numerically but was not statistically significant. These findings may be limited by the small number of patients in our study, as a previous study showed that HbSS individuals on hydroxyurea therapy had significantly lower LDH and plasma free hemoglobin [<xref rid=""R10"" ref-type=""bibr"">10</xref>]. We found that the hemolysis score was associated with higher HbS percentage, and lower hemoglobin and HbF percentage. Hydroxyurea use was associated with a lower hemolysis score. These findings were also found in the Nouriae study [<xref rid=""R2"" ref-type=""bibr"">2</xref>]. This is the first study to assess the relationship between the hemolysis score and WBC count and we found a significant association. This may be the case as both a higher hemolysis score and leukocytosis are associated with sickle cell severity [<xref rid=""R25"" ref-type=""bibr"">25</xref>]. Our findings may suggest that the hemolysis score which incorporates four hemolytic biomarkers that span intravascular and extravascular hemolysis, in contrast to PFH which reflects only intravascular hemolysis, may be a more robust marker of overall ‘blood injury’ and disease severity. Future studies are indicated to investigate the predictive value of the hemolysis score and its validity as a marker of disease severity and response to therapy. Limitations of our study include a small sample size, though this is due to the prospective nature of the data. Future studies will be aimed at incorporating more participant data and trending PFH and hemolysis score over time. Our study showed that PFH measured at baseline in patients with sickle cell disease was associated with other hemolytic markers LDH, AST, total bilirubin, and reticulocyte count. Intuitively, PFH was also associated with the hemolysis score which was derived from the first component of a principal component analysis of these hemolytic markers. PFH had a stronger relationship to LDH, AST, and bilirubin compared to reticulocyte percentage, suggesting that PFH may be more specific to intravascular hemolysis. These findings elucidate the relationship between PFH and other hemolytic biomarkers. Further studies will be needed to evaluate these relationships over time in both the acute and chronic settings, and in relation to clinical sequelae of sickle cell disease.",N/A,02 5 2024
DISPLACE study shows poor quality of transcranial doppler ultrasound for stroke risk screening in sickle cell anemia,"<list list-type=""simple"" id=""ulist0010""><list-item id=""u0010""><label>•</label><p id=""p0010"">DISPLACE study shows inconsistencies in the use and reporting of TCD for stroke risk screening in sickle cell anemia in the United States.</p></list-item><list-item id=""u0015""><label>•</label><p id=""p0015"">A standardized reporting template, training on the use of TCD in sickle cell anemia, and institutional quality assurance, is recommended.</p></list-item></list>  Children with sickle cell anemia (SCA) are at increased risk of stroke when compared with their age-based counterparts. The Stroke Prevention Trial in Sickle Cell Anemia (STOP) previously demonstrated that with the use of transcranial Doppler ultrasound (TCD; Sickle Stroke Screen) and chronic red cell transfusion, the risk of stroke is reduced by over 90%. The STOP criteria detailed the type and method of measurement required; the time–averaged mean maximum velocity (TAMMV). Unfortunately, it has been difficult to adhere to the appropriate TAMMV measurements. The objectives of this study were to assess the quality of TCD and transcranial Doppler imaging (TCDi) reports to determine the report quality and accuracy. This is a subanalysis of the DISPLACE (Dissemination and Implementation of Stroke Prevention Looking at the Care Environment) study. Over 12 000 TCD/TCDi reports were collected during this study from 28 institutions; 391 TCDs were reviewed for this subanalysis. There were significant variations in the vessels being assessed, the velocities used to define abnormal results, and who was interpreting the scans. In 52% of reports, it was impossible to identify whether the TAMMV was what was measured. Similarly, it was only clear in 42% of reports that the TAMMV was used to interpret the examination as normal/abnormal. Given this inconsistency, we strongly recommend standardization of TCD/TCDi reporting, specialized training for those performing and interpreting the scans in the use of TCD/TCDi in patients with SCA, internal quality assurance, and institutional quality improvement work to ensure appropriate use of this potentially lifesaving technology.","Children with sickle cell anemia (SCA) are at significantly increased risk of stroke when compared with their age-based counterparts, with up to an 11% chance of an overt stroke before the age of 20 in the prechronic transfusion era.<xref rid=""bib1"" ref-type=""bibr""><sup>1</sup></xref> The Stroke Prevention Trial in Sickle Cell Anemia (STOP), completed between 1995 and 1997, demonstrated that with the use of transcranial Doppler ultrasound (TCD; Sickle Stroke Screen), children at the highest risk for stroke could be identified and started on chronic red cell transfusion therapy (CRCT), thus reducing the risk of stroke by over 90%.<xref rid=""bib2"" ref-type=""bibr""><sup>2</sup></xref> This led to the adoption of the STOP protocol as standard of care, first announced in 1997 by the National Institutes of Health in a clinical alert,<xref rid=""bib3"" ref-type=""bibr""><sup>3</sup></xref> in which it is recommended that patients with SCA (genotypes HbSS and HbSβ0-thalassemia) between the ages of 2 and 16 years undergo routine yearly TCD screening and patients with abnormal findings should start chronic transfusion therapy. This guideline has been reaffirmed in several subsequent reports from the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI)<xref rid=""bib4"" ref-type=""bibr""><sup>4</sup></xref> and the American Society of Hematology (ASH).<xref rid=""bib5"" ref-type=""bibr""><sup>5</sup></xref> In defining the use of the TCD for SCA, the STOP protocol required measurement of the time–averaged mean maximum velocity (TAMMV) in the distal internal carotid artery (dICA) and proximal middle cerebral artery (MCA) with the following classifications: “normal,” if all TAMMV are <170 cm/sec; “conditional,” if there is at least 1 TAMMV of 170 to 199 cm/sec; and “abnormal,” if there is at least 1 TAMMV ≥200 cm/sec.<xref rid=""bib2"" ref-type=""bibr""><sup>2</sup></xref> CRCT to prevent stroke is indicated for abnormal TCD on 2 occasions or 1 TCD with TAMMV of ≥220 cm/sec. Now, more than 20 years after the publication of these findings, implementation of TCD is inconsistent across the United States and lacks standardization. The NHLBI recommended that facilities “do studies to compare their current equipment with STOP trial TCD equipment.”<xref rid=""bib3"" ref-type=""bibr""><sup>3</sup></xref> To meet the need for training in correct TCD use, the STOP investigators provided national trainings and workshops; however, these are no longer available. A standard nonimaging TCD as used in STOP was not available at all centers, therefore, some centers started to use the transcranial Doppler imaging (TCDi) technique. An early study assessing for differences between TCD and TCDi velocities published in 2001, demonstrated for the MCA that, TCDi velocities were about 10% lower than those measured with TCD,<xref rid=""bib6"" ref-type=""bibr""><sup>6</sup></xref> which has subsequently been confirmed in some studies<xref rid=""bib7"" ref-type=""bibr""><sup>7</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid=""bib8"" ref-type=""bibr""><sup>8</sup></xref> but not in others.<xref rid=""bib9"" ref-type=""bibr"">9</xref>, <xref rid=""bib10"" ref-type=""bibr"">10</xref>, <xref rid=""bib11"" ref-type=""bibr"">11</xref> In fact, the French National Authority for Health recommended use of the same thresholds for TCD and TCDi due to concern for potential over-transfusion in patients screened by TCDi.<xref rid=""bib12"" ref-type=""bibr""><sup>12</sup></xref> In some centers, angle correction, or adjusting the velocity based on the angle between the transducer and the vessel, is performed when using TCDi.<xref rid=""bib13"" ref-type=""bibr""><sup>13</sup></xref> The precise correlation between TCD and TCDi velocities is not clear and likely highly dependent on technique. The ASH guidelines published in 2020 continue to support the cutoff values defined in the initial STOP trial, but added recommendations for TCDi, citing the velocity used in the Silent Cerebral Infarct Transfusion (SIT) trial: mean velocity ≥185cm/sec is abnormal.<xref rid=""bib5"" ref-type=""bibr""><sup>5</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid=""bib14"" ref-type=""bibr""><sup>14</sup></xref> Since the routine use of TCD for stroke risk screening in SCA was instituted in 1997, there have been several studies evaluating site-level adherence to the recommendation to obtain annual TCD assessments.<xref rid=""bib15"" ref-type=""bibr"">15</xref>, <xref rid=""bib16"" ref-type=""bibr"">16</xref>, <xref rid=""bib17"" ref-type=""bibr"">17</xref> These studies used a variety of techniques for both examining barriers to TCD and facilitating improvement, including the use of personalized reminders<xref rid=""bib18"" ref-type=""bibr""><sup>18</sup></xref> and tracking patients overdue for imaging.<xref rid=""bib19"" ref-type=""bibr""><sup>19</sup></xref> One European study identified a major barrier to routine TCD screening, which was the lack of trained personnel to perform the procedure. To overcome this barrier, they recruited a variety of practitioners, including clinicians with ultrasound experience, surgeons, pediatricians, and nurses, from 3 centers to complete a TCD/TCDi training program. They noted that before this training, there was significant variation in the percentage of scans classified as abnormal among the institutions, while following training, there were no differences in the distribution of classifications.<xref rid=""bib20"" ref-type=""bibr""><sup>20</sup></xref> Each of these studies reports on barriers to appropriate and accurate stroke risk screening for children with SCA. However, none of these studies specifically addressed the quality of the reports themselves, assessed for the correct interpretation of measurements, or insured ongoing quality assurance. Only 1 study assessed the accuracy of the measurements themselves<xref rid=""bib20"" ref-type=""bibr""><sup>20</sup></xref> and no recent reports have demonstrated multi-institutional assessments of TCD quality. The recent DISPLACE (Dissemination and Implementation of Stroke Prevention Looking at the Care Environment) study was a 28-site consortium funded by the NHLBI to evaluate barriers to TCD screening implementation and test strategies to improve adherence to TCD guidelines in SCA in the US. DISPLACE demonstrated that less than 50% of children at participating SCA centers had annual TCD screening during the baseline period (2012-2016).<xref rid=""bib21"" ref-type=""bibr""><sup>21</sup></xref> This current project is a substudy using the DISPLACE database. In this study, we hypothesized that there would be both high variability in TCD/TCDi technique and that sites using TCDi would use inconsistent definitions to classify scans as “abnormal.” In addition, we wanted to determine if sites using TCDi were making treatment decisions regarding chronic transfusion therapy based on criteria other than those established by the STOP protocol.   The STOP study revolutionized care for pediatric patients with SCA, identifying a noninvasive method to monitor children at high risk of stroke and identifying a life-saving intervention (CRCT).<xref rid=""bib2"" ref-type=""bibr""><sup>2</sup></xref> However, despite this significant finding, several subsequent studies have shown poor implementation of TCD screening for a variety of reasons, including missed opportunities for referral and inconsistent technique.<xref rid=""bib16"" ref-type=""bibr""><sup>16</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid=""bib20"" ref-type=""bibr""><sup>20</sup></xref> Furthermore, there is no consistent means of ensuring that centers perform TCDs accurately. Only 1 European study performed a quality assessment of the technical capabilities of people performing stroke risk screening using TCD.<xref rid=""bib20"" ref-type=""bibr""><sup>20</sup></xref> This study initially sought to evaluate the quality of TCD reports across multiple institutions in the United States, with the hypothesis that there would be more variability in the interpretation of TCDi than TCDs. Instead, this study identified a startling lack of standardization across all sites including which vessels were measured, how the measurements were performed (with or without angle correction for TCDi), how the reports were interpreted, and who was reading and interpreting the report. The reports were so discrepant that it was not possible to assess whether measurements were accurately interpreted. TCD results have critical implications for medical decision making for children with SCA and our study reveals a significant lack of quality assurance and consistency in the reporting of stroke risk screening, using both TCD and TCDi. Most notably, many reports did not clearly identify which blood vessels were used to assess stroke risk, did not report on the correct velocity measurement (or lacked the information to determine if the correct velocity was measured), or made interpretations based on velocities other than TAMMV, the measurement validated in the STOP trial. Additionally, most reports reviewed in this study did not make note of whether a TCD or TCDi was performed, and for TCDi, it was frequently unclear if angle correction was performed which can affect cutoffs for normal, conditional, and abnormal. Corroborating these findings, survey data from the participating DISPLACE sites showed significant variation in the training methods used for those performing TCD. Though radiologists were the most common physicians interpreting results, some sites noted neurologists or hematologists assuming this role. The training of the interpreting physician was not assessed. This study revealed a significant lack of quality assurance in TCD technique and interpretation across 26 pediatric SCA centers in the United States, suggesting variability of result quality that could result in missed opportunities to prevent strokes. To address this, we have several recommendations for improved clarity of TCD reporting at pediatric SCA centers. First, we recommend the creation of a standardized template for TCD/TCDi reports to be used across institutions which includes the following key data: 1) specific type of TCD (TCD or TCDi) being used, 2) defined measurement (TAMMV, also abbreviated as TAMMX) for each vessel examined (MCA, dICA, anterior cerebral artery, etc), 3) numerical values noted for the TAMMV of each vessel that is assessed, 4) a clear impression statement indicating whether the TCD/TCDi is normal, abnormal, or conditional, with a clear definition of what values were used to categorize the results as such, and 5) a statement regarding the adequacy of the study. We additionally recommend consideration for the inclusion of comments about asymmetry<xref rid=""bib26"" ref-type=""bibr""><sup>26</sup></xref> and low values.<xref rid=""bib27"" ref-type=""bibr""><sup>27</sup></xref> Because there is some evidence to suggest utility in measuring peak systolic velocities,<xref rid=""bib28"" ref-type=""bibr""><sup>28</sup></xref> for sites measuring them we recommend inclusion in the body of the report but exclusion from the impression to prevent misinterpretation. Similarly, the assessment of additional vessels such as the anterior cerebral artery<xref rid=""bib29"" ref-type=""bibr""><sup>29</sup></xref> or the external portion of the ICA (eICA)<xref rid=""bib30"" ref-type=""bibr""><sup>30</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid=""bib31"" ref-type=""bibr""><sup>31</sup></xref> deserves further study. The format of these reports should be standardized in all electronic health records using a standardized data dictionary (as used by the National Alliance of Sickle Cell Centers) to facilitate both longitudinal assessment of individual patients and intra- and intercenter comparative quality assessment. Data should also be entered into the electronic health record in an easily extractable format to facilitate multi-institution reviews. Our recommended standardized template is provided in <xref rid=""fig1"" ref-type=""fig"">Figure 1</xref>. The standardization of measurements and methods used for interpretations is critical to allow comparison of data for use in research to advance the field, especially as novel medications and transformative therapies are being developed.<fig id=""fig1""><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p><bold>Proposed standardized template for TCD/TCDi reports.</bold> ACA, anterior cerebral artery; eICA, extracranial internal carotid artery; Hgb, hemoglobin; L, left; PCA posterior cerebral artery; R, right.</p></caption><graphic http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink href=""BLOODA_ADV-2024-012631-gr1""></graphic></fig> Regarding TCDi measurements, it has been shown in several studies that one can expect the velocities to be about 10% lower than TCD. However, this has not been confirmed, and thus, there are no established guidelines regarding interpretation. Sites using TCDi varied significantly in their definitions of conditional and abnormal velocities with or without angle correction. In the US, we recommend compliance with the ASH guidelines for TCDi, using a TAMMV ≥185 cm/sec to define abnormal<xref rid=""bib5"" ref-type=""bibr""><sup>5</sup></xref> until further studies or internal quality assurance suggests another threshold should be used as discussed below. We also recommend choosing 1 brand of TCD or TCDi that is used for all patients with SCA being cared for at an institution, to allow consistency within the institution as well as internal quality assurance. Most ideally, the same machine would be used for all patients undergoing TCD/TCDi for stroke risk screening at an institution, given the variability even among different equipment from the same manufacturer. While calibration of each machine for the performance of stroke risk screening for children with SCA would be optimal, there is not a recognized, guideline-approved method for this practice at this time. The equipment should undergo recalibration as recommended by the manufacturer to maintain the best precision. Triggers to evaluate the process and thresholds used within an institution could include a lack of abnormal scans (as this suggests the threshold for abnormal may be too high), a change in the percentage of abnormal results, and a clinical review of every patient who has a stroke that had undergone a TCD. The percentage of abnormal scans should be compared continuously both within and between SCA centers as the rates of abnormal TCD and frequency of stroke have changed as treatments have evolved. Hematologists, sonographers, and radiologists at SCA centers should work together to evaluate their practices and outcomes to improve local performance and outcomes. Finally, without successful and ongoing TCD/TCDi training for technologists and interpreting physicians, results from these scans may be unreliable. Though some institutions in DISPLACE reported having technologists trained in formal STOP training courses, most training is peer to peer and currently, there are no formal sickle cell–specific training opportunities. The authors feel these trainings should be reintroduced by either the National Alliance of Sickle Cell Centers or through a professional diagnostic medical sonography organization. A standardized training curriculum would improve both the technical performance of TCD/TCDi and its interpretation. Physicians interpreting TCD/TCDi should have specialized training in the use of TCD/TCDi for stroke risk screening. Hematology organizations and radiology organizations should work together to improve mutual understanding of TCD performance standards and their critical clinical significance.

The sites included in DISPLACE represent ∼30% of all pediatric SCA centers across the United States and did not include international centers. The TCDs included were performed between 2000 and 2016, and institutional practices may have changed since these were completed; though notably, there were no relevant differences in the quality of reports from the early time points compared with the later ones. When surveys were sent to DISPLACE PIs, they were requested to recall what their institution was doing during the study period (2012-2016); however, recall bias may have impacted the results toward reporting what the facilities are currently using. Evidence against recall bias, however, is previously published; original deidentified survey results from DISPLACE similarly showed that there was significant variation in cutoffs used for TCDi and vessels used in classification.<xref rid=""bib25"" ref-type=""bibr""><sup>25</sup></xref> In conclusion, though the STOP study clearly defined the importance of annual stroke risk screening with TCD for children with SCA, there continue to be barriers to implementation. Appropriate interpretation relies on accurate and consistent study performance, and continuous quality assessment is necessary. Consequently, this study serves as a call to action for immediate recalibration of TCD/TCDi assessment and reporting, including the need for standardized templates for electronic health records, reinstatement of formal training for both those performing and interpreting scans, and ongoing comparative quality analysis. We also recommend the inclusion of TCD quality assurance in future definitions of Pediatric Sickle Cell Disease Centers of Excellence, by the National Alliance of Sickle Cell Centers and consideration for inclusion of TCD–related quality assessment in US News and World Report rankings to incentivize institutions to invest in improvement. Accomplishing these goals will require engagement of the relevant stakeholders, identification of barriers to implementation, and funding. With these interventions, we can continue to work toward meeting the recommended screening and interventions instituted by the NHLBI over 25 years ago and optimize outcomes.

Roth Spots: A Rare Finding in Sickle Cell Anemia,"White-centered, flame-shaped retinal hemorrhages, also known as Roth spots, occur in several diseases, most often in subacute bacterial endocarditis. Other conditions such as leukemia, hypertensive retinopathy, and pre-eclampsia are other causes. Here, we present the case of a 32-year-old female with sickle cell anemia (HbSS) who was treated at the hospital after experiencing a sickle cell crisis. Fundus examination was performed to rule out sickle cell retinopathies, suggesting the presence of Roth spots in the retina which are rarely seen in sickle cell disease.","Sickle cell is an inherited hemoglobin disorder caused by homozygosity of the βS type of allele on the 11p15.5 chromosome. This genetic condition leads to substituting a glutamic acid, which is hydrophilic, with valine, which is hydrophobic at the sixth location in the β-chain. As a result, individuals with this disease have a mutated tetramer of hemoglobin known as HbS (α2βs2) in their erythroid cells. It poses unique challenges due to its impact on the vascular system [<xref rid=""REF1"" ref-type=""bibr"">1</xref>]. Roth spots, characterized by white-centered retinal hemorrhages, serve as important clinical indicators associated with a spectrum of medical conditions. While originally linked to subacute bacterial endocarditis, their presence has been documented in many conditions, including leukemia, hypertensive retinopathy, diabetic retinopathy, anemia, and pre-eclampsia. Among the myriad conditions associated with Roth spots, sickle cell anemia is a relatively uncommon but noteworthy entity [<xref rid=""REF2"" ref-type=""bibr"">2</xref>]. Various theories attempt to explain the origin of retinal hemorrhages with white centers, with the prevailing view attributing them to retinal capillary rupture due to endothelial cell dysfunction. Following vessel rupture, red blood cells leak out, which triggers the clotting chain reaction and forms fibrin-platelet plugs on the damaged endothelial cell lining. Histological studies confirm that the white lesions contain platelet-fibrin thrombi [<xref rid=""REF3"" ref-type=""bibr"">3</xref>]. A 32-year-old female with a history of homozygous (HbSS) sickle cell disease came to the emergency of the hospital with complaints of fever, chest pain, knee pain, and abdominal pain for three days. She had a history of multiple admissions with blood transfusions for similar complaints in the past. On physical examination, the patient’s blood pressure was 100/80 mmHg, pulse rate was 122 beats/minute, respiratory rate was 28 breaths/minute, and SpO<sub>2</sub> was 96% while breathing ambient room air. The patient was febrile to touch. On further examination, the patient had pallor and icterus. The remainder of the physical examination was otherwise unremarkable. Table <xref rid=""TAB1"" ref-type=""table"">1</xref> displays the results of the patient’s laboratory tests. Peripheral smear revealed features of sickle cell anemia (Figure <xref rid=""FIG1"" ref-type=""fig"">1</xref>). Sickling test revealed sickle cells (Figure <xref rid=""FIG2"" ref-type=""fig"">2</xref>). During the hospital stay, the patient complained of a diminution of vision, and a fundus examination revealed multiple white-centered retinal hemorrhages suggestive of Roth spots (Figure <xref rid=""FIG3"" ref-type=""fig"">3</xref>). Other causes of Roth spots were ruled out on clinical examination by retrospective evaluation. Blood cultures were sent, which showed no growth in the culture media. Two-dimensional echocardiography was done to look for infective endocarditis, but it was normal. The patient was started on injectable tramadol and hydration. The patient was transfused with packed red cells until her hemoglobin level increased to 10 g%. Hydroxyurea tablets were given. The patient was asked to follow up in the ophthalmology department after three weeks but was lost to follow-up. Sickle cell disease has been associated with ocular manifestations, specifically when linked to the retina, they are commonly referred to as sickle cell retinopathy. Retinopathies are the most common complications associated with sickle cell disease. The pathophysiology behind sickle cell retinopathy involves vaso-occlusion of retinal microvasculature due to the sickled red blood cells, which leads to ischemia and subsequent tissue damage in the retina. Commonly described clinical manifestations of sickle cell retinopathies include peripheral retinal vascular occlusion, retinal hemorrhages, cotton-wool spots, macular Ischemia, and neovascularization. Our case highlights a rare finding in sickle cell anemia, Roth spots, which are supposed to be the hallmark of infective endocarditis. Although Roth spots are non-specific red spots on the retina with white or pale centers, they can also occur in several other conditions, such as acquired immunodeficiency syndrome, hypertension, diabetes, collagen vascular disease, and extreme hypoxia. The initial retinal spots discovered in 1872 were thought to result from ruptured nerve fibers [<xref rid=""REF4"" ref-type=""bibr"">4</xref>]. Current investigation reveals that they may consist of infectious agents, localized ischemia, inflammatory infiltration, and coagulated fibrin, including platelets. Usually, a slit-lamp examination, which involves seeing within the eye with an ophthalmoscope, is used to observe them. Our case highlights Roth spots in sickle cell disease, which is a rare phenomenon [<xref rid=""REF5"" ref-type=""bibr"">5</xref>]. Vaso-occlusion and ischemia due to sickling of cells can damage any organ in the body, of which neurological manifestations have crucial importance as they can lead to disability. Hence, neuroimaging plays in role in helping to diagnose and prevent neurological complications. Effectively managing Roth spots in patients relies on identifying the underlying cause to prevent systemic and ocular complications associated with the primary disease. While small pre-retinal hemorrhages may resolve on their own, larger amounts of blood can lead to macular toxic damage due to prolonged exposure to hemoglobin and iron [<xref rid=""REF6"" ref-type=""bibr"">6</xref>]. Several techniques are available for treating macular subhyaloid hemorrhage, such as vitreal injections of recombinant tissue plasminogen activator, Nd:YAG laser hyaloidotomy, and pars plana vitrectomy. The use of Nd:YAG laser treatment is highlighted for its quick resolution of subhyaloid hemorrhage, potentially avoiding the necessity for more invasive vitreoretinal surgery [<xref rid=""REF7"" ref-type=""bibr"">7</xref>]. Sickle cell disease is primarily known for its ocular manifestations such as sickle cell retinopathy, which involves retinal vessel occlusion, ischemia, and neovascularization. However, the presence of Roth spots indicates complex ocular manifestations. Roth spots are an unusual finding in sickle cell, and by presenting this unique case, we contribute to the expanding knowledge on the ocular manifestations in sickle cell disease. Early detection and management of Roth spots can help prevent vision-threatening complications and improve overall patient outcomes.",N/A,26 4 2024
