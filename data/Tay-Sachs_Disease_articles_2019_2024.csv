"Novel <italic toggle=""yes"">HexA</italic> splice site mutations in a patient with late atypical onset Tay-Sachs disease: importance of combined NGS and biochemical analysis","Tay-Sachs disease (TSD) is a rare genetic disorder with diverse clinical manifestations, often leading to underdiagnosis due to symptom similarities with other neurological conditions. In this study, we aimed to identify the genetic mutations underlying late-onset TSD in a 27-year-old patient with progressive neurological symptoms. Whole-exome sequencing revealed two <italic toggle=""yes"">hexA</italic> gene mutations associated with TSD: a previously known variant, c.805G > A (p.Gly269Ser), and a novel splice-site mutation, c.346 + 2dupT. Through clinical assessments, genetic analysis, and functional investigations—including RNA sequencing and enzymatic activity assays—we confirmed the pathogenicity of the novel mutation. Our findings highlight the efficacy of advanced genomic technologies in diagnosing intricate genetic disorders and emphasize the significance of functional validation to confirm the effects of mutations. Identifying compound heterozygous mutations in the <italic toggle=""yes"">hexA</italic> gene also provides insight into Mendelian inheritance patterns. This case highlights the diagnostic challenges posed by overlapping clinical phenotypes and emphasizes the need for increased genetic awareness among clinicians. Accurate diagnosis of TSD has significant implications for patients and their families, allowing for informed genetic counseling and guiding clinical management decisions. While current treatment options are limited, timely and accurate diagnosis holds promise for future research and therapeutic interventions. This study highlights the value of a multidisciplinary approach in exploring the molecular basis of complex genetic diseases and informing clinical decisions.","Tay-Sachs disease (TSD) is the most common genetic disorder among GM2 gangliosidoses (<xref rid=""ref1"" ref-type=""bibr"">1</xref>). It is caused by pathogenic mutations in the <italic toggle=""yes"">hexA</italic> gene, leading to a deficiency of the enzyme <italic toggle=""yes"">β</italic>-hexosaminidase A (HexA), which is responsible for processing GM2 ganglioside into GM3 ganglioside in lysosomes (<xref rid=""ref2"" ref-type=""bibr"">2</xref>, <xref rid=""ref3"" ref-type=""bibr"">3</xref>). Depending on the remaining HexA activity level, TSD can manifest in several clinical forms: the acute infantile variant, which leads to early death at the age 4; the late-onset (or subacute) form, which allows survival into later childhood or adolescence, and the chronic form (or adult-onset) TSD (<xref rid=""ref4"" ref-type=""bibr"">4</xref>). Adult-onset TSD shows significant variation in the age of disease onset, with cases appearing as late as age 42, and presents with a wide range of clinical symptoms. Diagnosing late-onset TSD is particularly challenging due to its symptom overlap with other neurological disorders, such as spinal muscular atrophy (SMA), spinocerebellar ataxia (SCA), motor neuron disease (MND), and other neurodegenerative conditions, as well as the rarity of the disease in many populations. Several well-described variants are commonly found in TSD patients, including c.1277_1278insTATC, c.1421 + 1 G.C, and c.805 G.A (p.G269S), which are prevalent among Ashkenazi Jews and the Indian population (<xref rid=""ref5"" ref-type=""bibr"">5</xref>, <xref rid=""ref6"" ref-type=""bibr"">6</xref>). In the majority of TSD cases in Ashkenazi Jews, the condition is caused by an insertion in the beta-hexosaminidase alpha-chain gene, resulting in the synthesis of a non-functional protein (<xref rid=""ref7"" ref-type=""bibr"">7</xref>, <xref rid=""ref8"" ref-type=""bibr"">8</xref>). Other notable mutations include a large 7.6 kb deletion in the French Canadian population and the c.571–1 G.T mutation in the Japanese populations (<xref rid=""ref9"" ref-type=""bibr"">9</xref>, <xref rid=""ref10"" ref-type=""bibr"">10</xref>). To date, 164 pathogenic and 134 likely pathogenic variants have been reported in the <italic toggle=""yes"">hexA</italic> gene, but no clear mutational hotspots have been found (<xref rid=""ref11"" ref-type=""bibr"">11</xref>). As a result, performing point mutation analysis in routine clinical practice remains challenging for TSD. In this study, we present the second reported case of late-onset TSD in the Russian Federation, along with the identification of a novel causative mutation (<xref rid=""ref12"" ref-type=""bibr"">12</xref>). We employed a combined next-generation sequencing (NGS) approach to analyze both mutational load and transcript data, followed by biochemical confirmation of the causative effect of the identified mutation’s variant pathogenicity. We suggest that next-generation sequencing at both high-throughput DNA and RNA levels is an effective tool for elucidating the hereditary background of TSD, including in cases where the diagnosis is uncertain.   In this study, we aimed to identify the genetic cause of inherited ataxia in a patient who could not be accurately diagnosed based on clinical symptoms or various clinical tests. Using whole-exome sequencing, we identified two mutations in the <italic toggle=""yes"">hexA</italic> gene, one of which is novel. The alteration in the gene’s nucleotide sequence is known to impair the enzymatic function of hexosaminidase A, initiating a pathological process that leads to the accumulation of toxic GM2 gangliosides, thereby causing severe somatic symptoms. We did not find any other pathogenic or likely pathogenic variants in any other gene that could explain the patient’s symptoms. One of the identified variants, с.805G > A, is a well-known mutation associated with the adult-onset form of TSD in Ashkenazi Jews. The second variant c.346 + 2dupT which likely disrupts a donor splice site, had not been previously reported, and its pathogenicity was unclear. To support the pathogenicity of this novel <italic toggle=""yes"">HEXA</italic> variant, we performed both an <italic toggle=""yes"">in silico</italic> analysis and a functional <italic toggle=""yes"">in vitro</italic> study. The <italic toggle=""yes"">in silico</italic> analysis suggested that this variant disrupts correct splicing at the second exon–intron junction. Genetic testing of other family members showed that the patient’s mother and sister carry the с805G > A variant, while the father carries the c.346 + 2dupT variant, demonstrating Mendelian inheritance, which, in turn, May explain why none of the family members, except for the patient, exhibit the illness phenotype. The RNA-seq analysis confirmed that the c.346 + 2dupT variant disrupts the splicing process, leading to transcripts lacking the second exon. RNA samples from the patient and his father demonstrated that approximately 50% of transcripts were spliced incorrectly, with the second exon skipped. It is worth noting that exon2 encodes a part of the beta-hexosaminidase domain, which is essential for <italic toggle=""yes"">HEXA</italic> activity (<xref rid=""ref18"" ref-type=""bibr"">18</xref>). Additionally, the RNA-seq data revealed a known pathogenic variant in exon 7, rs121907954 (chr15:72642859, NM_001318825.1:.838G > A), in all samples except for the father’s. In the patient, one allele carries the pathogenic c.805G > A variant, while the second allele lacks the second exon, severely compromising <italic toggle=""yes"">HEX</italic> A gene activity. In contrast, the father’s second allele remains intact, allowing for the production of wild-type transcripts and normal enzyme synthesis. Finally, the enzymatic activity assay showed only traces of <italic toggle=""yes"">HEXA</italic> activity in the patient’s blood, whereas the enzyme activity levels in the blood samples of the mother, father, and sister were within the normal range. The significant reduction in protein activity in the patient provides strong evidence for the pathogenicity of compound mutation. The case report described in this study clearly highlights the critical role of whole-exome sequencing in achieving an appropriate diagnosis. The patient’s symptoms did not allow clinicians to initially suspect TSD, resulting in a delay of more than 6 years before the correct diagnosis was made. A similar case of late-onset TSD in the Russian Federation took more than 13 years to diagnose (<xref rid=""ref12"" ref-type=""bibr"">12</xref>). The rarity of the disease, especially its atypical forms, compounds the challenge, as it often leads to a lack of clinical expertise. For instance, even after identifying the pathogenic <italic toggle=""yes"">HEXA</italic> gene variant, an ophthalmological examination revealed no cherry-red spot characteristic of TSD. Several aspects strongly suggest that the novel <italic toggle=""yes"">hexA</italic> gene variant is indeed pathogenic: Thus, whole-exome analysis revealed a novel mutation in the <italic toggle=""yes"">hexA</italic> gene and aided in clarifying the clinical diagnosis in a patient with hereditary ataxia of unknown etiology. Currently, no optimal therapy exists for TSD. Clinical trials for bone marrow transplantation and enzyme replacement therapy have been unsuccessful. However, establishing an accurate diagnosis offers significant benefits for both the patient and their family by eliminating the need for unnecessary diagnostic procedures and reducing financial costs. Moreover, a clear and precise diagnosis enables family members to seek genetic counseling for informed reproductive decisions. This case, along with several other reports of late-onset TSD, suggests that the disease May be under-recognized as a cause of neurodegenerative or ataxia-related symptoms (<xref rid=""ref19"" ref-type=""bibr"">19</xref>, <xref rid=""ref20"" ref-type=""bibr"">20</xref>). There is a necessity to increase clinicians’ awareness about the disease, which will lead to a timely and correct diagnosis and the development of genetic counseling among variant carriers ideally resulting in a reduction of new TSD cases in the population. This study provides a comprehensive analysis of a late-onset TSD case, demonstrating the value of next-generation sequencing in diagnosing complex genetic disorders. By identifying both a known mutation (c.805G > A) and a novel splice site mutation (c.346 + 2dupT) in the <italic toggle=""yes"">hexA</italic> gene, we establish a strong genetic basis for the patient’s clinical symptoms. Functional assessments, including RNA sequencing and enzymatic activity assays, provide compelling evidence for the pathogenicity of the novel mutation, shedding light on its impact on hexosaminidase A activity. This study highlights the significance of combining genetic analysis with functional validation to confidently determine the causative mutations. The findings highlight the diagnostic challenges of disorders with overlapping clinical presentations and emphasize the importance of genetic awareness among clinicians. Furthermore, the accurate diagnosis not only informs the patient’s clinical management but also enables informed genetic counseling for the family. While therapeutic options for TSD remain limited, early and precise diagnosis holds valuable implications for future research and potential interventions. This investigation emphasizes the importance of a multidisciplinary approach in unraveling the molecular basis of genetic diseases and guiding clinical decision-making.",N/A,04 10 2024

Treating late-onset Tay Sachs disease: Brain delivery with a dual trojan horse protein,"Tay-Sachs (TS) disease is a neurodegenerative disease resulting from mutations in the gene encoding the α-subunit (HEXA) of lysosomal β-hexosaminidase A (HexA). We report that (1) recombinant HEXA alone increased HexA activity and decreased GM2 content in human TS glial cells and peripheral mononuclear blood cells; 2) a recombinant chimeric protein composed of HEXA linked to two blood-brain barrier (BBB) entry elements, a transferrin receptor binding sequence and granulocyte-colony stimulating factor, associates with HEXB <italic toggle=""yes"">in vitro</italic>; reaches human cultured TS cells lysosomes and mouse brain cells, especially neurons, <italic toggle=""yes"">in vivo</italic>; lowers GM2 in cultured human TS cells; lowers whole brain GM2 concentration by approximately 40% within 6 weeks, when injected intravenously (IV) to adult TS-mutant mice mimicking the slow course of late-onset TS; and increases forelimbs grip strength. Hence, a chimeric protein equipped with dual BBB entry elements can transport a large protein such as HEXA to the brain, decrease the accumulation of GM2, and improve muscle strength, thereby providing potential treatment for late-onset TS.  Stern and colleagues generated a recombinant protein composed of HEXA linked to two BBB entry elements, a transferrin receptor binding sequence and G-CSF. Injected IV to a slowly progressive TS mouse model, this protein (1) reached the brain, (2) lowered brain GM2, and (3) increased forelimb strength.","Tay-Sachs (TS) disease is an autosomal recessive neurodegenerative disease resulting from deficiency of lysosomal β-hexosaminidase A (HexA) activity due to inherited mutations in the α-subunit gene. As a result, the enzyme is inactive, which leads to the accumulation of the GM2 ganglioside in neuronal lysosomes and to extra-lysosomal GM2 aggregates. This eventually results in severe cellular dysfunction, cell death, and progressive neurodegeneration.<xref rid=""bib1"" ref-type=""bibr""><sup>1</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid=""bib2"" ref-type=""bibr""><sup>2</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid=""bib3"" ref-type=""bibr""><sup>3</sup></xref> In human and other mammalian tissues, β-hexosaminidase exists in two major forms: HexA, a heterodimer of the α- and β-subunits (αβ) encoded by two different genes, HEXA and HEXB, and a homodimeric HexB (ββ).<xref rid=""bib1"" ref-type=""bibr""><sup>1</sup></xref> A third form, HexS, consisting of the homodimer αα, normally comprises only a minor fraction of β-hexosaminidase, but is more prominently expressed in Sandhoff disease, which results from inherited defects in the HEXB gene. The formation of the HexA is controlled by complex mechanisms culminating in the association of the α- and β-subunits. Both subunits undergo a succession of post-translational modifications in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), which include removal of the signal peptide on the amino terminal end, N-glycosylation with high-mannose oligosacharides,<xref rid=""bib4"" ref-type=""bibr""><sup>4</sup></xref> followed by formation of disulfide bonds and tertiary folding of the polypeptides. There is controversy regarding whether αβ assembly occurs in the ER or the Golgi apparatus, but either the enzyme or the polypeptides are transported to the Golgi apparatus such that the α/β ratio seems to be well-regulated.<xref rid=""bib5"" ref-type=""bibr""><sup>5</sup></xref> Mannose-6-phosphate (M6P) recognition elements are generated in the Golgi apparatus, as the mannose residues of the glycosylated amino acids α asparagine115, α asparagine 295, and β asparagine 84 are preferentially phosphorylated.<xref rid=""bib4"" ref-type=""bibr""><sup>4</sup></xref> This modification enables the M6P receptor in the Golgi apparatus to recognize and target the enzyme to the lysosomes.<xref rid=""bib6"" ref-type=""bibr""><sup>6</sup></xref> In the lysosome, the enzyme is subjected to final processing, including the maturation of the α-chain, which includes removal of the precursor peptide (i.e., the polypeptide sequence leucine 23-leucine 90<xref rid=""bib7"" ref-type=""bibr""><sup>7</sup></xref>). Consequently, HexA can degrade GM2 in the presence of the GM2 activator protein. Late-onset TS (LOTS), a rare disorder, first described in 1973,<xref rid=""bib8"" ref-type=""bibr""><sup>8</sup></xref> is a slow variant of the more widely recognized infantile TS disease. Owing to less severe enzymatic deficiency, its clinical onset is delayed to late childhood through early adulthood, with a slower deterioration compared with the rapidly progressive, lethal infantile form. Its estimated incidence in the Ashkenazi Jewish population of 1 in 135,000; the incidence in the non-Jewish population is unknown, but may approximate that of infantile TS or Sandhoff disease (1 in 300,000) in this group.<xref rid=""bib9"" ref-type=""bibr""><sup>9</sup></xref> A detailed literature review on LOTS has been recently published.<xref rid=""bib10"" ref-type=""bibr""><sup>10</sup></xref> No effective treatment is currently available for TS or LOTS disease. Enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) is a strategy that has been clinically approved for some lysosomal storage diseases such as Gaucher disease.<xref rid=""bib11"" ref-type=""bibr""><sup>11</sup></xref> However, even though normal HexA can now be prepared, ERT has thus far not been offered to TS patients since the enzyme cannot cross the blood-brain barrier (BBB).<xref rid=""bib12"" ref-type=""bibr""><sup>12</sup></xref> To overcome this problem and enable transport of replacement protein for TS, we reasoned that a functional protein smaller than the entire approximately 1,000-Kd HexA might be easier to transport across the BBB. We also assumed that protein composed of the replacement enzyme sequence linked to two independent entry elements, each independently capable of passage through the BBB might allow its effective transport through the BBB. That partial correction of HexA activity in TS <italic toggle=""yes"">in vitro</italic> by selective replacement of the α chain in HexA-deficient fibroblasts was suggested by one study,<xref rid=""bib13"" ref-type=""bibr""><sup>13</sup></xref> but not confirmed in another report.<xref rid=""bib14"" ref-type=""bibr""><sup>14</sup></xref> Here, we re-tested this approach in a human TS cell line <italic toggle=""yes"">in vitro</italic>. We then applied it <italic toggle=""yes"">in vivo</italic> in a TS mouse model by engineering a chimeric protein in which the alpha subunit was fused, via by a flexible peptide linker, to two BBB entry elements known to each independently cross the BBB: the granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) followed by a small transferrin receptor binding sequence.<xref rid=""bib15"" ref-type=""bibr""><sup>15</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid=""bib16"" ref-type=""bibr""><sup>16</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid=""bib17"" ref-type=""bibr""><sup>17</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid=""bib18"" ref-type=""bibr""><sup>18</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid=""bib19"" ref-type=""bibr""><sup>19</sup></xref>  In this report, we used the long-established Trojan horse approach for protein delivery across the BBB, which is modified, for the first time, to include a dual BBB entry mechanism rather than a single Trojan horse carrier. This novel method, applied to a model of adult TS in mice, is conceptually summarized in <xref rid=""fig2"" ref-type=""fig"">Figure 2</xref>C. The transport across the BBB of very large protein, such as beta-hexosaminidase A, composed of two subunits encoded by two separate gene, HEXA and HEXB, each eventually transcribed into approximately 500 amino acid sequences, seems to be formidable. It is, therefore, notable that the engineered Tr-G-CSF-HEXA administered via peripheral delivery, was able to dose dependently and substantially decrease brain GM2. It should be further considered that brain GM2 accumulated during more than a full year of life was decreased by approximately 40% within just 6 weeks of treatment, in association with a gain of forelimb muscle strength. As such, this report suggests a treatment-related sizable effect on the course of the disease. This treatment effect is, then, distinct from the prevention of disease by neonatal or early-onset treatment modalities, in a disease characterized by late onset. On this background, earlier studies examined the possibility to treat TS using small molecules that easily cross the BBB and could potentially lower brain GM2. Miglustat, an inhibitor of glycosphingolipid biosynthesis, was effective in decreasing brain GM2 in a TS mouse model,<xref rid=""bib20"" ref-type=""bibr""><sup>20</sup></xref> but failed to favorably affect the disease course in human subjects with LOTS.<xref rid=""bib21"" ref-type=""bibr""><sup>21</sup></xref> Venglustat, a second-generation substrate reducing agent has improved CNS penetration and is currently in clinical trials for LOTS and late onset Sandhoff’s disease (<ext-link ext-link-type=""ClinicalTrials.gov"" http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink href=""NCT04221451"" id=""intref0010"">NCT04221451</ext-link>). Pyrimethamine, shown to enhance HexA activity <italic toggle=""yes"">in vitro</italic>, apparently acting as a protein chaperone,<xref rid=""bib22"" ref-type=""bibr""><sup>22</sup></xref> did not achieve clinical benefits in LOTS patients in two clinical trials, using either an escalating dose or cyclic administration.<xref rid=""bib23"" ref-type=""bibr""><sup>23</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid=""bib24"" ref-type=""bibr""><sup>24</sup></xref> In recent years, gene delivery using viral vectors such as several adeno-associated virus (AAV) serotype elicited favorable effects in the treatment of TS models in small animals, initially through direct injection of the virus into the CNS, thereby bypassing the BBB, but subsequently even via peripheral administration.<xref rid=""bib25"" ref-type=""bibr""><sup>25</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid=""bib26"" ref-type=""bibr""><sup>26</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid=""bib27"" ref-type=""bibr""><sup>27</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid=""bib28"" ref-type=""bibr""><sup>28</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid=""bib29"" ref-type=""bibr""><sup>29</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid=""bib30"" ref-type=""bibr""><sup>30</sup></xref> In an early report, Guidotti et al.<xref rid=""bib25"" ref-type=""bibr""><sup>25</sup></xref> found that, to overcome the deficient alpha subunit of the heterodimeric protein HexA in TS, only overexpression of both subunits through peripheral co-administration of adenoviral vectors encoding HEXA and HEXB was able to sufficiently increase serum HexA (42% of wild-type levels). Direct injection to the brain of several viral vectors encoding either HEXA or HEXB or both seemed to yield impressive improvements in brain GM2 and extended the lifespan of mice with the rapidly progressing and lethal Sandhoff’s disease if injected early enough in the post-natal weeks (26–30). Observations that AAV9-based vectors carrying a number of genes were shown to penetrate the BBB via peripheral administration and correct abnormal metabolism and storage in several disease models, including TS, potentially obviated the need for direct injections to the brain.<xref rid=""bib31"" ref-type=""bibr""><sup>31</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid=""bib32"" ref-type=""bibr""><sup>32</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid=""bib33"" ref-type=""bibr""><sup>33</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid=""bib34"" ref-type=""bibr""><sup>34</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid=""bib35"" ref-type=""bibr""><sup>35</sup></xref> Several related examples in humans that are based on the principles outlined above include the current clinical use of nusinersen, an oligonucleotide sequence injected intrathecally to treat infantile or late-onset spinal atrophy<xref rid=""bib36"" ref-type=""bibr""><sup>36</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid=""bib37"" ref-type=""bibr""><sup>37</sup></xref>; onasemnogene abeparvovec, a single dose of IV AAV9 carrying the complementary DNA encoding the missing survival motor neuron 1<xref rid=""bib38"" ref-type=""bibr""><sup>38</sup></xref>; and, last, risdiplam, an orally administered, small molecule that modifies SMN2 pre-mRNA splicing and increases levels of functional SMN protein,<xref rid=""bib39"" ref-type=""bibr""><sup>39</sup></xref> thus entirely bypassing the need to overcome the BBB. Several reports indicated that modified AAV vectors carrying modified HEXA or HEXB subunits were able to favorably affect GM2 gangliosidoses. In two related reports, Tropak and colleagues<xref rid=""bib40"" ref-type=""bibr""><sup>40</sup></xref> and Karumuthil-Melethil et al.<xref rid=""bib41"" ref-type=""bibr""><sup>41</sup></xref> designed and applied a modified alpha subunit incorporating specific beta-subunit sequences required to form a stable, HexB-like homodimer, and those sequences needed for the homodimer to interact with the GM2AP-GM2 complex, which they termed HEXM. This homodimer has HexA-like activity and could be expressed from a single gene packageable within a self-complementary AAV vector. To avoid potential liver toxicity<xref rid=""bib42"" ref-type=""bibr""><sup>42</sup></xref> or carcinogenesis,<xref rid=""bib43"" ref-type=""bibr""><sup>43</sup></xref> which may occur with high-dose AAV9 vectors, they elected to pack HEXM into an advanced form of AAV9 vector, AAV9.47, which affords substantially diminished targeting to the liver but maintains high brain penetration with IV administration. When administered IV to neonatal TS mice, HEXM transgene achieved long-term GM2 reduction. In adult TS mice, it was capable of degrading GM2 in a localized manner when injected intracranially. Thus, at the present time, this novel approach is effective as systemic therapy early on, but requires local intracranial delivery in the adult TS mouse. Whether this relates to the immaturity of the BBB in early life vs. fuller maturity in adult mice<xref rid=""bib44"" ref-type=""bibr""><sup>44</sup></xref> or changes in mice size with maturation is unclear. A recent report in an ongoing study of two infants with infantile TS using an AAV (an equimolar mix of AAVrh8-HEXA and AAVrh8-HEXB) gene therapy delivered intrathecally around the cisterna magna and the thoracolumbar junction showed some disease deceleration.<xref rid=""bib45"" ref-type=""bibr""><sup>45</sup></xref> Finally, ERT is widely applied in several non-CNS lysosomal disorders.<xref rid=""bib46"" ref-type=""bibr""><sup>46</sup></xref> Selective replacement of only the mutated subunit in TS, HEXA was discarded 20 years ago, after a report that even large amounts of the soluble α subunit to cultured TS fibroblasts failed to reach the lysosomes in a sufficient quantity to hydrolyze cell GM2.<xref rid=""bib14"" ref-type=""bibr""><sup>14</sup></xref> However, Kitakaze et al.<xref rid=""bib47"" ref-type=""bibr""><sup>47</sup></xref> generated a modified HexB, that, following direct intracerebroventricular injection to the CNS, was able to lower brain GM2 10-week-old Sandhoff mice, preceding the rapid neurological deterioration typical for this disease model. In all, then, at the present time, the systemic treatment of adult TS, rather than prevention in neonates with TS, remains an experimentally and clinically unmet challenge. Therefore, the findings in our report that HEXA alone as well as hTr-G-CSF-HEXA decreases GM2 in human TS glial cells and that HEXA lowers GM2 in PBMC cultures harvested from LOTS patients would support the notion that HEXA per se, presumably associating with endogenous unmutated HEXB in TS, confers the ability to lower GM2. Potential additional or alternative pathways were not pursued in the present report. Rather, we present a chimeric protein that carries HEXA as the therapeutic element, transported through the BBB by two independent Trojan horses poised in succession. This is the first description of a dual entry approach to carry a large enzyme/enzyme subunit across the BBB. This is also the first description of G-CSF as a <italic toggle=""yes"">trans</italic>-BBB carrier. Both HEXA and G-CSF retain their respective activities, which are relevant to TS: HEXA to lower GM2 and G-CSF, known to cross the intact BBB<xref rid=""bib16"" ref-type=""bibr""><sup>16</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid=""bib17"" ref-type=""bibr""><sup>17</sup></xref> and, potentially, promote cell survival (which entails receptor binding). The idea that the transferrin receptor, which is broadly expressed on cells comprising the BBB can serve as an anchor to enzyme and protein delivery has been proposed by Partridge more than two decades ago.<xref rid=""bib48"" ref-type=""bibr""><sup>48</sup></xref> Antibodies to the transferrin receptors and other ligands have been also tried [reviewed by Boado<xref rid=""bib49"" ref-type=""bibr""><sup>49</sup></xref> and Partridge<xref rid=""bib50"" ref-type=""bibr""><sup>50</sup></xref>], of which we selected a short sequence that binds to the Tr receptor. Either Tr or G-CSF fused alone to HEXA showed GM2-lowering effect in adult TS mice, but the impact was more consistent when the chimeric protein combined both motifs. An inherent and potentially important advantage of the dual entry element approach is that it may be less susceptible to physiological or random inter-individual variability in receptor expression for either transferrin or G-CSF receptor; for example, the first is known to vary inversely to iron balance<xref rid=""bib51"" ref-type=""bibr""><sup>51</sup></xref> and the latter shows random widespread variability of expression in the human brain<xref rid=""bib52"" ref-type=""bibr""><sup>52</sup></xref> and may be down-regulated by inflammation and some cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor-α<xref rid=""bib53"" ref-type=""bibr""><sup>53</sup></xref> or interleukin-1β,<xref rid=""bib54"" ref-type=""bibr""><sup>54</sup></xref> which could be overexpressed in late TS.<xref rid=""bib55"" ref-type=""bibr""><sup>55</sup></xref> Our study has several limitations. Unlike humans, mice can use some compensating action by neuraminidase {`sialidase '} that can recycle hexosaminidase B cleavage products in the lysosome,<xref rid=""bib56"" ref-type=""bibr""><sup>56</sup></xref> thereby limiting disease severity and delaying symptoms, reminiscent of the late and gradual course of human LOTS. However, Tr-G-CSF-HEXA is not related to sialidase and still can not only lower brain GM2, but elicit improvement in forelimb muscle strength. We did not segregate the independent kinetics and contribution of the G-CSF element and the Tr element to the <italic toggle=""yes"">trans</italic>-BBB trafficking of Tr-G-CSF-HEXA. Both elements showed entry effects in independent studies with Tr-HEXA or G-CSF-HEXA. However, this was less consistent in terms of GM2 reduction than the bimodal molecule, which suggest that the relative contribution of each of the entry elements may be variable <italic toggle=""yes"">in vivo</italic>. We did not quantify the percentage of the injected protein entering the brain or its penetration, but did observe that the protein enters other tissues as well, such as the heart and kidneys, which are not protected by entry barriers such as the BBB. The finding that there Tr-G-CSF-HEXA was practically undetectable in the liver suggests that the relative between-tissue distribution may vary with time. Finally, because transferrin as well as G-CSF receptors are present in non-CNS tissues, the possibility of unwanted effects in some non-brain target organs cannot be ruled out. The exclusion of any potential side effects by G-CSF may require further testing. It is noteworthy, however, that blood count was not affected by repeated administration of Tr-G-CSF-HEXA during the 6 weeks of the <italic toggle=""yes"">in vivo</italic> experiments. Last, we did not address the potential ability of G-CSF per se to enhance skeletal muscle regeneration<xref rid=""bib57"" ref-type=""bibr""><sup>57</sup></xref> or neuronal stem cell differentiation in the brain.<xref rid=""bib58"" ref-type=""bibr""><sup>58</sup></xref> In conclusion, the current study offers three major advancements regarding the treatment of LOTS and, possibly, beyond. First, we show that replacement therapy based on the replacement with the native, unmodified alpha subunit of HEXA alone can lower brain GM2 in human TS cells, including PMBCs from LOTS patients and in a mouse model of LOTS. Second, we show that this treatment is effective, in terms of brain GM2 and increase in muscle strength even in the adult mouse at a phase in which forelimb strength is already declining. Last, we present a <italic toggle=""yes"">trans</italic>-BBB delivery system of peripherally injected proteins that can enter the brain using a dual entry mechanism: utilization of the well-described transferrin receptor <italic toggle=""yes"">trans</italic>-BBB transport coupled with the herein first described G-CSF-dependent delivery.

Infantile Monosialoganglioside2 (GM2) Gangliosidosis With Concurrent Bronchopneumonia: An Extraordinary Case of Tay-Sachs Disease,"Tay-Sachs disease (TSD) is a rare, fatal neurodegenerative disorder characterized by the deficiency of the enzyme hexosaminidase-A (Hex A), which results in the accumulation of monosialoganglioside2 (GM2) ganglioside within nerve cells, predominantly affecting individuals of Ashkenazi Jewish descent. We report a remarkable case of a three-year-old South Asian male with infantile GM2 gangliosidosis, compounded by bronchopneumonia, a rarely documented complication in Tay-Sachs patients. The patient presented with recurrent seizures, fever, cough, and developmental delay. Confirmation of the diagnosis was obtained through reduced Hex A enzyme activity, corroborated by imaging and blood and urine analyses. Family history was significant for consanguinity and similar sibling fatalities. Despite the progressive nature of the disease, symptomatic management, including antiepileptic drugs, antibiotic therapy, and supportive care, led to an improvement in clinical condition, though ongoing monitoring remains essential. In this case, the coexistence of bronchopneumonia with Tay-Sachs disease is unusual, reflecting the necessity for this case report. The patient's response highlights the potential for symptomatic management, the importance of genetic counseling, and the imperative for research into gene and enzyme replacement therapies. The uniqueness of this case provides novel insights into the disease's spectrum, enhancing awareness, encouraging early diagnosis, and refining care strategies for Tay-Sachs disease, aligning with the broader goals of improving patient outcomes and advancing medical research.","Tay-Sachs disease (TSD), also known variously as hexosaminidase A (HEXA) deficiency, monosialoganglioside2 (GM2) gangliosidosis type 1, hexosaminidase alpha-subunit deficiency (variant B), B variant GM2 gangliosidosis, and sphingolipidosis Tay-Sachs, is an inherited, devastating neurological disorder. It is characterized by a deficiency of the enzyme hexosaminidase-A, leading to the accumulation of GM2 ganglioside (ganglioside monosialic), a fatty substance, within nerve cells. This accumulation causes progressive neuronal deterioration and severe neurological manifestations [<xref rid=""REF1"" ref-type=""bibr"">1</xref>]. While it is considered a rare condition, Tay-Sachs disease has an estimated incidence of one in 200,000 live births within the general population, with prevalence rates varying among different communities. Certain ethnicities, such as Ashkenazi Jews, exhibit a higher incidence [<xref rid=""REF2"" ref-type=""bibr"">2</xref>]. Due to its rarity, Tay-Sachs disease is the focus of various advocacy groups dedicated to rare diseases. These organizations work closely with researchers, clinicians, and affected families to raise awareness about the disorder and its significant challenges [<xref rid=""REF3"" ref-type=""bibr"">3</xref>]. This case report meticulously documents a clinical encounter with Tay-Sachs disease manifesting in a young child, which is atypical considering the early infantile onset commonly associated with this condition. By presenting this case, we aim to enhance the collective understanding of Tay-Sachs disease's clinical spectrum, contribute to better recognition and diagnosis across diverse age groups, and inform more effective treatment strategies for those afflicted by this debilitating illness. A three-year-old male child was brought to the hospital with a recent onset of recurrent tonic-clonic seizures lasting 2-3 minutes, a low-grade intermittent fever, and a non-productive dry cough. The child had a significant past medical history of developmental delays, food refusal, and previous hospital admissions for similar presentations. He was diagnosed with GM2 (ganglioside monosialic) gangliosidosis (Tay-Sachs disease) at a local hospital based on reduced Hex A enzyme activity, blood and urine analyses, and brain MRI findings, along with a family history indicative of a hereditary pattern due to parental consanguinity. MRI brain has been elaborated in Figure <xref rid=""FIG1"" ref-type=""fig"">1</xref>. Upon clinical examination, the child was found to have a Glasgow Coma Scale score of 8/15, decreased muscle tone and wasting in the lower limbs, brisk reflexes, and down-going plantar responses. His respiration was rapid and shallow, with crackles noted in the lower zone of the left lung, and ocular twitching was present. These findings suggested a possible respiratory infection. Laboratory tests, including a complete blood count, renal and liver function tests, and serum electrolytes, were essentially regular, with minor elevations in lymphocyte count and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) levels. Urinalysis showed a turbid appearance with trace proteins. The chest X-ray revealed an opacity in the lower left lung field, indicative of bronchopneumonia. The chest X-ray is shown in Figure <xref rid=""FIG2"" ref-type=""fig"">2</xref>. A complete blood workup has been provided in Table <xref rid=""TAB1"" ref-type=""table"">1</xref>. The child's acute presentation was determined to be a combination of his underlying GM2 gangliosidosis with superimposed bronchopneumonia. Treatment was initiated with vigilant bi-hourly monitoring and nasogastric feeding for nutritional support. Chest physiotherapy and postural drainage were employed to manage the respiratory condition. A regimen of intravenous linezolid, Tanzo®, amikacin sulfate, and antiepileptic medications, including topiramate, lamotrigine, and nitrazepam, was administered. After a five-day course of treatment, there was an improvement in the patient's GCS to 11/15, and the antibiotic therapy was slightly de-escalated while maintaining the rest of the treatment. The child's condition improved significantly throughout the treatment. Yet, he continued to be monitored closely due to the complex nature of his underlying genetic disorder and its interplay with infectious complications. The case highlights the critical need for comprehensive care in managing similar patients with neurodegenerative diseases complicated by common pediatric illnesses. This confluence of Tay-Sachs disease with bronchopneumonia in a patient of this age, against a backdrop of familial consanguinity, represents a particularly rare and instructive case with significant implications for the management of similar complex pediatric presentations. Tay-Sachs disease is an autosomal recessive genetic disorder that requires both parents to be carriers for their child to inherit the condition. The disease has a higher prevalence in Ashkenazi Jewish populations, with approximately one in 27 being carriers. In contrast, the general population's carrier rate is about one in 300. Compared to these statistics, Tay-Sachs is exceedingly rare in South Asian populations, where the carrier frequency is estimated to be around one in 250, aligning with the global average [<xref rid=""REF4"" ref-type=""bibr"">4</xref>]. This case is particularly unusual due to the patient's South Asian descent, which adds to its rarity and clinical significance. Clinically, Tay-Sachs predominantly affects the nervous system. Typical symptoms include seizures, nutritional deficiencies, vision and hearing loss, and respiratory problems [<xref rid=""REF5"" ref-type=""bibr"">5</xref>]. Our patient experienced seizures, a nutritional deficit, and a loss of motor power, along with an atypical complication of bronchopneumonia. The co-occurrence of bronchopneumonia with Tay-Sachs disease is an unusual association and a notable aspect of this case. There is currently no cure for Tay-Sachs disease; thus, management is directed towards supportive care, including anti-epileptic drugs, antibiotics for concurrent infections, nutritional support, and other measures to prevent complications. Genetic counseling for the parents is also crucial in managing this condition [<xref rid=""REF6"" ref-type=""bibr"">6</xref>]. In the case of our patient, a conventional treatment protocol was administered, augmented with antibiotic therapy for bronchopneumonia and chest physiotherapy. Public awareness about Tay-Sachs disease and continued research into novel therapeutic interventions is essential. Advances such as gene therapy and enzyme replacement therapy are promising avenues that could transform the management of this disease, making them more broadly available to the public [<xref rid=""REF7"" ref-type=""bibr"">7</xref>]. This case report's significance lies not only in the rarity of Tay-Sachs disease within the South Asian population but also in the presentation of bronchopneumonia as a complicating factor. The discussion around this case underscores the clinical complexity and the need for a multidisciplinary approach to care. Our patient's case exemplifies the challenges faced when a relatively common pediatric condition intersects with a rare genetic disorder, and it emphasizes the importance of considering a broader differential diagnosis. Sharing this case contributes to the body of knowledge required to improve patient care and outcomes for those with similar presentations, making it a worthy addition to the corpus of medical case reports. An important limitation of this case report warrants mention. While we have strived to provide a comprehensive analysis of this unique case of Tay-Sachs disease, our ability to include a broader range of diagnostic images, particularly those illustrating central nervous system (CNS) reflexes, was constrained. Despite diligent efforts to gather extensive visual data, the availability of such specific images was limited. We acknowledge that additional imaging could have further enriched the understanding of the neurological manifestations in this case. To mitigate this limitation, we have focused on delivering detailed, descriptive accounts of the clinical observations and neurological reflexes observed in the patient. This approach was intended to provide a thorough narrative compensating for the lack of extensive visual documentation. We believe that the detailed textual descriptions offer a substantial understanding of the patient's condition, albeit the visual representation remains an acknowledged limitation of this report. This case report presents an atypical occurrence of Tay-Sachs disease, a rare genetic disorder, with concurrent bronchopneumonia in a three-year-old. Despite the progressive and incurable nature of Tay-Sachs, the child showed improvement with a regimen of antiepileptics, antibiotics, and supportive care. Highlighting the necessity for innovative treatments and genetic counseling, this case emphasizes the importance of awareness and research to improve the prognosis and quality of life for those affected by this devastating condition. The report's rarity and the child's unique presentation significantly contribute to the medical literature and patient care strategies.",N/A,7 1 2024
Lipid-Lowering Drug Gemfibrozil Protects Mice from Tay-Sachs Disease via Peroxisome Proliferator-Activated Receptor α,"Tay-Sachs disease (TSD) is a progressive heritable neurodegenerative disorder characterized by the deficiency of the lysosomal β-hexosaminidase enzyme (Hex<sup>−/−</sup>) and the storage of GM2 ganglioside, as well as other related glycoconjugates. Along with motor difficulties, TSD patients also manifest a gradual loss of skills and behavioral problems, followed by early death. Unfortunately, there is no cure for TSD; however, research on treatments and therapeutic approaches is ongoing. This study underlines the importance of gemfibrozil (GFB), an FDA-approved lipid-lowering drug, in inhibiting the disease process in a transgenic mouse model of Tay-Sachs. Oral administration of GFB significantly suppressed glial activation and inflammation, while also reducing the accumulation of GM2 gangliosides/glycoconjugates in the motor cortex of Tay-Sachs mice. Furthermore, oral GFB improved behavioral performance and increased the life expectancy of Tay-Sachs mice. While investigating the mechanism, we found that oral administration of GFB increased the level of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor α (PPARα) in the brain of Tay-Sachs mice, and that GFB remained unable to reduce glycoconjugates and improve behavior and survival in Tay-Sachs mice lacking PPARα. Our results indicate a beneficial function of GFB that employs a PPARα-dependent mechanism to halt the progression of TSD and increase longevity in Tay-Sachs mice.","Tay-Sachs disease (TSD) disease is an autosomal recessive lysosomal storage disorder of the central nervous system (CNS), characterized by the heritable absence of the enzyme β-hexosaminidase A (HEXA), which is essential for the degradation of GM2 gangliosides. Therefore, the progressive accumulation of GM2 and subsequent neurodegeneration are pathological hallmarks of TSD [<xref rid=""B1-cells-12-02791"" ref-type=""bibr"">1</xref>,<xref rid=""B2-cells-12-02791"" ref-type=""bibr"">2</xref>]. As a rare disease, the carrier rate for TSD is about 1 in 250–300 people, with an incidence of approximately 1 in 320,000 live births in the US [<xref rid=""B2-cells-12-02791"" ref-type=""bibr"">2</xref>,<xref rid=""B3-cells-12-02791"" ref-type=""bibr"">3</xref>,<xref rid=""B4-cells-12-02791"" ref-type=""bibr"">4</xref>]. On the other hand, among Ashkenazi Jews, the incidence of TSD is estimated to be around 1 in 3600 [<xref rid=""B2-cells-12-02791"" ref-type=""bibr"">2</xref>,<xref rid=""B3-cells-12-02791"" ref-type=""bibr"">3</xref>,<xref rid=""B4-cells-12-02791"" ref-type=""bibr"">4</xref>]. GM2 ganglioside is an intermediate molecule of sphingolipids and other glycoconjugates. Therefore, mutations in the genes encoding <italic toggle=""yes"">HEXA</italic> cause the accumulation of GM2 ganglioside into the lysosome, leading to GM2 gangliosidoses Tay–Sachs (TSD, OMIM #272800). There are about 14 different axons of HEXA harboring more than 175 known mutations, including those found in French Canadians, Cajuns, Irish, and Brazilians [<xref rid=""B5-cells-12-02791"" ref-type=""bibr"">5</xref>]. Among Ashkenazi Jews, p.Tyr427Ilefs*5 and a donor splice-junction mutation in intron 12, c.1421+1G>C, account for over 90% of TSD cases, leading to severe, infantile-onset disease. On the other hand, among the non-Jewish population, while the c.1073+1G>A mutation results in severe disease, the p.Gly269Ser mutation is associated with adult-onset disease [<xref rid=""B2-cells-12-02791"" ref-type=""bibr"">2</xref>,<xref rid=""B5-cells-12-02791"" ref-type=""bibr"">5</xref>]. Sphingolipid metabolism, including gangliosides, is highly regulated for the differentiation and development of the central nervous system (CNS), and its expression is essential for the maintenance of the functional integrity of the nervous system [<xref rid=""B6-cells-12-02791"" ref-type=""bibr"">6</xref>,<xref rid=""B7-cells-12-02791"" ref-type=""bibr"">7</xref>]. The GM2 ganglioside accumulation leads to several cytotoxic effects that take place mainly in neurons, causing neuronal death [<xref rid=""B8-cells-12-02791"" ref-type=""bibr"">8</xref>]. Glial activation and dysfunction are salient features of neuroinflammatory and neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer’s disease (AD), Parkinson’s disease (PD), and multiple sclerosis (MS) [<xref rid=""B9-cells-12-02791"" ref-type=""bibr"">9</xref>,<xref rid=""B10-cells-12-02791"" ref-type=""bibr"">10</xref>,<xref rid=""B11-cells-12-02791"" ref-type=""bibr"">11</xref>,<xref rid=""B12-cells-12-02791"" ref-type=""bibr"">12</xref>]. Recent studies showed that the storage of GM1 and GM2 gangliosides in the CNS led to microgliosis and astrogliosis, and that the degree of inflammation correlates with increased levels of ganglioside accumulation [<xref rid=""B11-cells-12-02791"" ref-type=""bibr"">11</xref>]. Therefore, agents capable of inhibiting glial activation and inflammation in Tay-Sachs pathogenesis might offer neuroprotection in TSD. We previously revealed that gemfibrozil (GFB), a drug approved by the FDA for lipid lowering, inhibits the expression of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) and proinflammatory cytokines in astrocytes and microglia [<xref rid=""B13-cells-12-02791"" ref-type=""bibr"">13</xref>,<xref rid=""B14-cells-12-02791"" ref-type=""bibr"">14</xref>,<xref rid=""B15-cells-12-02791"" ref-type=""bibr"">15</xref>]. Here, we examined the effect of GFB on inflammation and overall glycoconjugate induced pathology in a mouse model of TSD, and observed that oral administration of GFB was capable of reducing glial inflammation and lowering glycoconjugates in the motor cortex of Tay-Sachs mice. Since GFB is an agonist of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor α (PPARα), we investigated its role in GFB-mediated neuroprotection and found that GFB remained unable to reduce TSD pathology and increase longevity in Tay-Sachs mice lacking PPARα. Our results suggest that oral GFB may have therapeutic importance for TSD.   Tay-Sachs disease (TSD), a fatal inherited lysosomal storage disorder, leads to neurological dysfunction of the brain primarily due to the lack of Hex A, an enzyme characterized by defective GM2 ganglioside [<xref rid=""B27-cells-12-02791"" ref-type=""bibr"">27</xref>]. Infants with TSD appear healthy at birth, but progressive GM2 accumulation causes loss of motor function and cognition, developmental regression, hind limb plasticity, muscle weakness, dystonia, blindness, seizures, and death in childhood [<xref rid=""B28-cells-12-02791"" ref-type=""bibr"">28</xref>]. Despite intensive investigations, there is no effective therapy or lines of treatment available for TSD. Although several therapeutic approaches have been suggested, like therapeutic enzyme replacement [<xref rid=""B29-cells-12-02791"" ref-type=""bibr"">29</xref>], bone marrow transplantation [<xref rid=""B30-cells-12-02791"" ref-type=""bibr"">30</xref>], substrate deprivation therapy [<xref rid=""B31-cells-12-02791"" ref-type=""bibr"">31</xref>], hematopoietic [<xref rid=""B32-cells-12-02791"" ref-type=""bibr"">32</xref>] or neural stem cell transplantation [<xref rid=""B33-cells-12-02791"" ref-type=""bibr"">33</xref>], use of chemical chaperones and oligonucleotide recombination [<xref rid=""B34-cells-12-02791"" ref-type=""bibr"">34</xref>], or a combination of all. However, until now, none of these therapies has led to a successful treatment option for TSD. GFB, known as Lopid in the pharmacy, has been used in humans for the treatment of hyperlipidemia since its FDA approval in 1982 without any report of adverse incident [<xref rid=""B35-cells-12-02791"" ref-type=""bibr"">35</xref>]. Although continuous treatment of rodents with fibrate drugs like gemfibrozil for 45–50 weeks leads to the formation of hepatic tumor [<xref rid=""B36-cells-12-02791"" ref-type=""bibr"">36</xref>,<xref rid=""B37-cells-12-02791"" ref-type=""bibr"">37</xref>], such tumor promotion is not seen in humans, other primates, and guinea pigs, species that have lost their capacity to produce ascorbate due to inherent loss of the <italic toggle=""yes"">gulonolactone oxidase</italic> gene [<xref rid=""B36-cells-12-02791"" ref-type=""bibr"">36</xref>,<xref rid=""B38-cells-12-02791"" ref-type=""bibr"">38</xref>]. Several lines of indication presented in this manuscript clearly exhibit that GFB is capable of protecting mice from Tay-Sachs toxicity. Our conclusion is based on the following. <italic toggle=""yes"">First</italic>, similar to TSD, neuroinflammation driven by activated astroglia and microglia is seen in the brain of Hexa<sup>−/−</sup> mice (here termed as Tay-Sachs mice). It is being increasingly recognized that understanding the heterogeneity of microglial activation in the context of disease may facilitate the design of therapeutics that dampen the detrimental effects of microglial activation [<xref rid=""B39-cells-12-02791"" ref-type=""bibr"">39</xref>,<xref rid=""B40-cells-12-02791"" ref-type=""bibr"">40</xref>]. Here, two months of GFB treatment markedly reduced astrocytic and microglial inflammation in the motor cortex of Tay-Sachs mice. <italic toggle=""yes"">Second</italic>, gait abnormality is a characteristic feature of TSD as well as Tay-Sachs mice. However, oral GFB significantly inhibited gait and behavioral impairments in Tay-Sachs mice. <italic toggle=""yes"">Third</italic>, as seen in TSD, Tay-Sachs mice also die early. However, a significant increase in life expectancy of Tay-Sachs mice was seen after GFB treatment. These results suggest that GFB may have implications in TSD therapy. Due to the mutation of the <italic toggle=""yes"">Hexa</italic> gene, patients with Tay-Sachs disease exhibit the accumulation of G<sub>M2</sub> ganglioside in the CNS, and therefore, successful treatments should be associated with the reduction of ganglioside deposition. While untreated Tay-Sachs mice displayed ganglioside inclusion bodies in the motor cortex, GFB treatment markedly reduced ganglioside deposition. It has been shown that the accumulation of undegraded gangliosides is directly linked to the activation of microglial cells [<xref rid=""B41-cells-12-02791"" ref-type=""bibr"">41</xref>,<xref rid=""B42-cells-12-02791"" ref-type=""bibr"">42</xref>]. It is nice to see that clearance of storage materials mapped directly to regions where enzymatic activity was present, as determined by PAS staining, and microglia expansion/activation was also absent in the same regions. Several studies have also delineated that pathological accumulation of GM1 or GM2 is capable of triggering apoptosis [<xref rid=""B8-cells-12-02791"" ref-type=""bibr"">8</xref>,<xref rid=""B43-cells-12-02791"" ref-type=""bibr"">43</xref>,<xref rid=""B44-cells-12-02791"" ref-type=""bibr"">44</xref>]. Accordingly, marked apoptosis was found in the motor cortex of Tay-Sachs mice that was strongly inhibited by oral GFB. Therefore, by suppressing pathological ganglioside accumulation, GFB treatment may decrease glial inflammation and protect neurons from apoptosis. The mechanism by which GFB may reduce ganglioside accumulation from the brain is also becoming clear. Lysosomal biogenesis and associated autophagy play an important role in the removal of aggregated biomolecules from the cells. Several studies from our lab and others have shown that GFB stimulates lysosomal biogenesis and autophagy in neurons and glial cells [<xref rid=""B16-cells-12-02791"" ref-type=""bibr"">16</xref>,<xref rid=""B45-cells-12-02791"" ref-type=""bibr"">45</xref>,<xref rid=""B46-cells-12-02791"" ref-type=""bibr"">46</xref>]. Transcription factor EB (TFEB) is considered the master regulator of lysosomal biogenesis, and we have also seen that GFB increases lysosomal biogenesis via peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor α (PPARα)-mediated transcription of TFEB [<xref rid=""B45-cells-12-02791"" ref-type=""bibr"">45</xref>]. Moreover, activation of PPARα is reported to reduce neuroinflammation via upregulation of anti-inflammatory molecules such as SOCS3 and IL-1Ra [<xref rid=""B47-cells-12-02791"" ref-type=""bibr"">47</xref>,<xref rid=""B48-cells-12-02791"" ref-type=""bibr"">48</xref>]. Hence, to find out the core mechanism behind ganglioside reduction, we primarily sought to monitor the level of PPARα in the brains of Tay-Sachs mice. Therefore, reduced levels of PPARα in the motor cortex of Tay-Sachs mice might be responsible for the chronic accumulation of GM2 gangliosides. This finding was verified in Tay-Sachs<sup>ΔPPARα</sup> mice in which GFB remained unable to reduce the accumulation of PAS-stained glycoconjugates and improve longevity. Therefore, it appears that GFB-mediated activation of PPARα is perhaps the underlying reason behind the neuroprotective effect of GFB in Tay-Sachs mice. Although currently, there is no approved therapy or cure for TSD, scientists are proposing several approaches (e.g., enzyme replacement therapy, substrate reduction therapy, hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, gene therapy, chemical chaperones, antisense oligonucleotides, etc.) [<xref rid=""B29-cells-12-02791"" ref-type=""bibr"">29</xref>,<xref rid=""B30-cells-12-02791"" ref-type=""bibr"">30</xref>,<xref rid=""B31-cells-12-02791"" ref-type=""bibr"">31</xref>,<xref rid=""B32-cells-12-02791"" ref-type=""bibr"">32</xref>,<xref rid=""B33-cells-12-02791"" ref-type=""bibr"">33</xref>,<xref rid=""B34-cells-12-02791"" ref-type=""bibr"">34</xref>]. However, GFB has several advantages over these proposed approaches. For example, GFB can be taken orally, and it is fairly non-toxic [<xref rid=""B14-cells-12-02791"" ref-type=""bibr"">14</xref>]. After oral intake, it is capable of crossing the blood-brain barrier [<xref rid=""B48-cells-12-02791"" ref-type=""bibr"">48</xref>]. It increases the lifespan of <italic toggle=""yes"">Cln2<sup>(−/−)</sup></italic> mice, an animal model of late-infantile neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis, via PPARα [<xref rid=""B49-cells-12-02791"" ref-type=""bibr"">49</xref>]. However, at present, we do not know anything about the level of PPARα in TSD patients. Since GFB needs PPARα to display neuroprotection in Tay-Sachs mice, in the absence of a basal level of PPARα, GFB may not exhibit optimal therapeutic efficacy in TSD patients. Therefore, future studies could be directed to address this aspect. In summary, this study demonstrates that the oral administration of gemfibrozil, an FDA-approved lipid-lowering drug in humans, decreases glial inflammation, reduces glycoconjugate storage materials, attenuates apoptosis, increases locomotor activities, and extends the lifespan of Tay-Sachs mice. Mechanistically, GFB exhibits a neuroprotective effect in Tay-Sachs mice via PPARα. Although the in vivo state of Tay-Sachs mice does not truly recapitulate the in vivo scenario of TSD patients, and not much is known about the status of PPARα in TSD, our results suggest that oral GFB may have therapeutic importance in TSD.",N/A,19 8 2024

<styled-content style=""fixed-case"" toggle=""no"">Late‐onset Tay−Sachs</styled-content> disease presenting with a neuromuscular phenotype—a case series",,"Tay−Sachs disease (TSD) is a rare, autosomal recessive condition, in which variants in hexosaminidase A (<italic toggle=""yes"">HEXA</italic>) lead to reduced β‐hexosaminidase A activity resulting in toxic ganglioside accumulation in neurons and microglia of the brain and spinal cord. Patients typically present in infancy with motor regression, seizures, myoclonus and progressive macrocephaly, resulting in death between the ages of 2 and 3 years. Late‐onset Tay−Sachs (LOTS) is a rare form of the disease that can present in childhood or later and has a more indolent course. Those with infantile TSD are usually homozygotes for severe deleterious alleles, whereas LOTS patients tend to be compound heterozygotes resulting in residual β‐hexosaminidase activity [<xref rid=""ene16069-bib-0001"" ref-type=""bibr"">1</xref>]. Its heterogeneous phenotype consists of cerebellar, neuromuscular, pyramidal or extrapyramidal dysfunction, as well as neuropsychiatric features [<xref rid=""ene16069-bib-0002"" ref-type=""bibr"">2</xref>]. Four unrelated patients with LOTS, of non‐Ashkenazi Jewish origin, in whom neuromuscular weakness accounted for the initial presentation and dominated the clinical course are presented. Patient 1 is a 42‐year‐old Slovakian man who presented with progressive proximal lower limb weakness which began in his early 30s, first noted as a difficulty walking and climbing stairs, having been developmentally normal and physically active into adulthood. Examination was significant for symmetric, predominantly proximal lower limb weakness and a positive Gowers' sign. There was mild distal upper limb weakness. Fasciculations and wasting were noted in the quadriceps. Reflexes were absent at the knees and the ankles but present and not brisk elsewhere. There were no cerebellar, pyramidal or extrapyramidal signs. One additional case with a pure neuromuscular phenotype (patient 2) is presented with slowly progressive lower limb girdle weakness without additional findings on examination 30 years after initial presentation. Patients 3 and 4 also presented with neuromuscular weakness and, although this was the dominant feature of the presentation, cerebellar and pyramidal signs were found on examination; patient 4 had a tremor since childhood which was felt to be extrapyramidal (see Table <xref rid=""ene16069-tbl-0001"" ref-type=""table"">1</xref>). In patients 1, 2 and 4, biallelic pathogenic variants in the <italic toggle=""yes"">HEXA</italic> gene were identified in advance of confirming a deficiency of plasma hexosaminidase A. In patient 3, detection of reduced plasma hexosaminidase A prompted confirmatory genetic testing. Although motor nerve conduction studies were within normal limits in all cases, needle electromyography demonstrated findings consistent with chronic denervation and re‐innervation (including complex repetitive discharges, reduced recruitment and polyphasic compound muscle action potentials of increased duration) in a non‐length‐dependent pattern, compatible with a motor neuronopathy. Sensory nerve action potential amplitudes were reduced in patients 3 and 4. MRI brain in all patients was normal, without cerebellar atrophy. Four unrelated patients with LOTS presenting with non‐length‐dependent neuromuscular weakness are described. Anterior horn cell dysfunction in LOTS is well described; however, it typically occurs as part of a broader phenotype. Previous phenotypic studies of LOTS describe cerebellar, extrapyramidal and neuropsychiatric features occurring in addition to neuromuscular weakness. Whilst some cases may present with a neuromuscular predominant phenotype, additional features such as tandem gait ataxia are typically seen on examination [<xref rid=""ene16069-bib-0003"" ref-type=""bibr"">3</xref>, <xref rid=""ene16069-bib-0004"" ref-type=""bibr"">4</xref>, <xref rid=""ene16069-bib-0005"" ref-type=""bibr"">5</xref>]. Cerebellar atrophy on MRI, which is almost always seen, was not a feature in this case series. The more indolent course of LOTS is probably accounted for by residual levels of hexosaminidase A resulting from two missense alleles, in contrast to its complete absence seen in the more classical infantile form resulting from expression of two null alleles [<xref rid=""ene16069-bib-0001"" ref-type=""bibr"">1</xref>]. The age of symptom onset in our series was at the later end of the spectrum seen in LOTS which poses the question of a link between age of onset and a milder phenotype, although in previous case series such a link has only been established in one case [<xref rid=""ene16069-bib-0002"" ref-type=""bibr"">2</xref>]. Since their diagnosis, patients 1 and 4 report one sibling each with suggestive symptoms although neither have been formally diagnosed. No other symptomatic relatives have been reported by our patients, despite patients 3 and 4 sharing the same compound heterozygous variants. The heterogeneous presentation of LOTS leads to a high rate of misdiagnosis, with a mean diagnostic latency of 11.9 years [<xref rid=""ene16069-bib-0002"" ref-type=""bibr"">2</xref>]. This case series illustrates the neuromuscular phenotype in LOTS, that of a non‐length‐dependent motor neuronopathy, which can occur in the absence of other clinical features and without cerebellar atrophy on MRI.

Genesis of a Fact: Tay-Sachs Disease as a “Simple Recessive”,"“Obvious” recessive inheritance of Tay-Sachs disease (TSD; OMIM # 272800) took over half a century to be established. Points now taken for granted were problematic, that: (1) TSD is a biological entity, not an artificial selection of concurrent findings, (2) manifestations have narrow limits, (3) it was not part of a spectrum of disorders, and can be differentiated from other conditions, (4) it will not change to another disease, (5) it is due to a single specific gene, (6) there are no secondary causes, (7) the gene has no apparent clinical effects unrelated to TSD, and (8) the gene is inherited only as a clinical recessive. To a large extent, resolution reflected biochemical understanding that took until mid-20th century, and beyond, to change how physicians viewed diseases in general. With this, biochemical carrier screening and prenatal biochemical diagnosis have become routinely available, and it is a model for carrier population screening, while gene therapy for the disease has been reported with some degree of success. Here, the history of medical ideas about TSD and its inheritance are reviewed to show how it achieved its current status as a distinct recessive disorder.",Full text not available in PMC,N/A,12 6 2023
Autophagic flux is impaired in the brain tissue of Tay-Sachs disease mouse model,"Tay-Sachs disease is a lethal lysosomal storage disorder caused by mutations in the HexA gene encoding the α subunit of the lysosomal β-hexosaminidase enzyme (HEXA). Abnormal GM2 ganglioside accumulation causes progressive deterioration in the central nervous system in Tay-Sachs patients. <italic toggle=""yes"">Hexa-/-</italic> mouse model failed to display abnormal phenotype. Recently, our group generated <italic toggle=""yes"">Hexa-/-Neu3-/-</italic> mouse showed severe neuropathological indications similar to Tay-Sachs patients. Despite excessive GM2 ganglioside accumulation in the brain and visceral organs, the regulation of autophagy has not been clarified yet in the Tay-Sachs disease mouse model. Therefore, we investigated distinct steps of autophagic flux using markers including LC3 and p62 in four different brain regions from the <italic toggle=""yes"">Hexa-/-Neu3-/-</italic> mice model of Tay-Sachs disease. Our data revealed accumulated autophagosomes and autophagolysosomes indicating impairment in autophagic flux in the brain. We suggest that autophagy might be a new therapeutic target for the treatment of devastating Tay-Sachs disease.","Tay-Sachs disease (TSD) is one of the lysosomal storage diseases (LSD) caused by a mutation in the HexA gene, encoding for the α subunit of lysosomal β-hexosaminidase A (HEXA), responsible for the degradation of GM2 to GM3 ganglioside [<xref rid=""pone.0280650.ref001"" ref-type=""bibr"">1</xref>]. Consequently, in TSD pathology, accumulated GM2 in neurons leads to neuronal death and progressive neurodegeneration in affected children. Tay-Sachs patients also have developmental delay, muscle weakness, spasticity, dementia, blindness, and epilepsy followed by death at the age of two to four. <italic toggle=""yes"">Hexa-/-</italic> mice were generated for further thought of TSD’s pathophysiology [<xref rid=""pone.0280650.ref002"" ref-type=""bibr"">2</xref>, <xref rid=""pone.0280650.ref003"" ref-type=""bibr"">3</xref>]. However, <italic toggle=""yes"">Hexa-/-</italic> mice did not show any neurological phenotype although the presence of limited GM2 ganglioside accumulation in neurons. Recently, we generated a mice model with a combined deficiency of <italic toggle=""yes"">Hexa</italic> and <italic toggle=""yes"">Neu3</italic> genes which showed abnormalities in the size and numbers of lysosomes in all tissues studied, especially in the brain due to abnormal GM2 accumulation. <italic toggle=""yes"">Hexa-/-Neu3-/-</italic> undergo progressive neurodegeneration with neural loss and Purkinje cell depletion and survived up to 5 months. In addition, neuroinflammation has been postulated as a pathophysiological mechanism due to the excessive activation of glial cells and the infiltration of numerous inflammatory cells in the brain of <italic toggle=""yes"">Hexa-/-Neu3-/-</italic> mouse [<xref rid=""pone.0280650.ref004"" ref-type=""bibr"">4</xref>, <xref rid=""pone.0280650.ref005"" ref-type=""bibr"">5</xref>]. In mammalian cells, two major mechanisms are carried out for the degradation of intracellular proteins: the ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS) and autophagy [<xref rid=""pone.0280650.ref006"" ref-type=""bibr"">6</xref>]. In particular, autophagy is involved in lysosome-dependent pathways for damaged organelles, unfolded proteins, and accumulated cellular components to maintain cellular homeostasis [<xref rid=""pone.0280650.ref007"" ref-type=""bibr"">7</xref>]. Autophagic flux includes vesicle trafficking and a network in which newly produced autophagosomes (double-membrane vesicles) are fused with lysosomes to degrade autophagic cargo. In this process, autophagore formation, autophagosome completion with the closure of the membrane, and autophagosome-lysosome fusion (autolysosome) take place respectively [<xref rid=""pone.0280650.ref008"" ref-type=""bibr"">8</xref>]. Each step of autophagic flux is finely regulated by specific protein complexes and the initiation step, the sequestering of autophagic cargo within an isolation membrane (phagophore), is controlled by the Beclin-1 [<xref rid=""pone.0280650.ref009"" ref-type=""bibr"">9</xref>]. Autophagy-related (Atg) proteins generate phagophore assembly sites and enable the envelopment of cytoplasmic material. In particular, the Atg9 protein is a key regulator of autophagy induction. During the maturation of autophagosome, Atg7 has involved in the conversion of the cytosolic form of microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3 (LC3-I) to LC3-II which is located on both inner and outer autophagosomal membranes [<xref rid=""pone.0280650.ref009"" ref-type=""bibr"">9</xref>]. LC3 involves in phagophore edge folding resulting in autophagosome formation. After the formation of autolysosomes formed by the combination of autophagosomes and lysosomes, LC3-II on the outer membrane is converted back to LC3-I and then intra-autophagosomal LC3-II is degraded by lysosomal hydrolyses. Therefore, the level of LC3-II as a marker of dynamic autophagosomal membranes is generally studied to monitor autophagic activity [<xref rid=""pone.0280650.ref010"" ref-type=""bibr"">10</xref>]. In addition, the level of ubiquitin-binding scaffold protein p62 (aggregated endogenous substrates) which know to be associated with LC3-II in the autophagosome is mostly evaluated as a marker of termination of autophagy [<xref rid=""pone.0280650.ref009"" ref-type=""bibr"">9</xref>, <xref rid=""pone.0280650.ref011"" ref-type=""bibr"">11</xref>]. A bunch of studies also showed a defect in autophagic flux and secondary accumulation of autophagic substrates such as autophagosomes in several LSDs [<xref rid=""pone.0280650.ref006"" ref-type=""bibr"">6</xref>, <xref rid=""pone.0280650.ref012"" ref-type=""bibr"">12</xref>–<xref rid=""pone.0280650.ref014"" ref-type=""bibr"">14</xref>].

However, the precise molecular mechanisms underlying their physiological or pathological activities are poorly understood. It has been shown that gangliosides released under pathological conditions may induce autophagic cell death of astrocytes in vitro [<xref rid=""pone.0280650.ref020"" ref-type=""bibr"">20</xref>]. In addition, <italic toggle=""yes"">Matarrese et al</italic>. have shown that GD3 ganglioside actively contributes to the biogenesis and maturation of autophagic vacuoles upon induction [<xref rid=""pone.0280650.ref021"" ref-type=""bibr"">21</xref>]. Activation of autophagy-dependent α-Syn clearance using GM1 ganglioside was also demonstrated in experimental models of Parkinson’s disease (PD) <italic toggle=""yes"">in vivo</italic> and <italic toggle=""yes"">in vitro</italic> [<xref rid=""pone.0280650.ref022"" ref-type=""bibr"">22</xref>]. GM2 ganglioside, on the other hand, is an intermediate substrate for biosynthesis and degradation of complex brain gangliosides such as GM1a, GD1a, GD1b, and GT1b [<xref rid=""pone.0280650.ref023"" ref-type=""bibr"">23</xref>]. Therefore, the effect of abnormally accumulated GM2 ganglioside in neurons is important for cellular processes including autophagy flux. In the current work, we examined whether accumulated GM2 ganglioside in lysosomes causes alteration in autophagic machinery in four brain regions of early-onset TSD mice model by qRT-PCR, Western Blot, and immunohistochemical techniques. Dysfunctional autophagy was demonstrated in <italic toggle=""yes"">Hexa-/-Neu3-/-</italic> mice as indicated by the increase in LC3-II and accumulation of autophagosomes. Our results provide a guide for future work that elucidates the contribution of altered autophagy to TSD pathology.  5-month-old <italic toggle=""yes"">Hexa-/-</italic> and <italic toggle=""yes"">Hexa-/-Neu3-/-</italic> mice (n = 3) were anesthetized and perfused through the heart with 0.9% NaCl and 4% Para-formaldehyde. Brains were incubated in the fixative solution overnight at 4°C and the following day sucrose density gradient (10%, 20%, and 30% sucrose in PBS) was applied. Embedded brains in OCT (Sigma) were sectioned coronally (10μm) using Leica Cryostat (CM1850-UV) at -20°C. Sections were stained with anti-LC3 (8ug/ul, R&D Systems), anti-Lamp1 (1:500, Abcam), and anti-p62 (1:500, Thermo) primary antibodies overnight at 4°C. The binding of primary antibodies was visualized using goat-anti-rat (IgH H&L AlexaFluor 568) for anti-LC3 and anti-rabbit (IgG Alexa Fluor 488) for anti-Lamp1 and anti-p62. The slides were mounted with Fluoroshield mounting medium with DAPI (Abcam, USA) The images were obtained by Fluorescence Microscopy (Olympus-BX53F). Co-localization analysis of red and green fluorescence was measured using ImageJ. GraphPad Prism 7 (v. 7.0a, GraphPad Software, Inc) was used to perform all statistical analyses. <italic toggle=""yes"">WT</italic>, <italic toggle=""yes"">Hexa-/-</italic>, <italic toggle=""yes"">Neu3-/-</italic>, and <italic toggle=""yes"">Hexa-/-Neu3-/-</italic> groups were compared by one-way ANOVA. All values are presented as mean ± SEM.  Lysosomal dysfunction resulting from the accumulation of endogenous substrates in lysosomes is the hallmark of LSDs including GM2 gangliosidosis [<xref rid=""pone.0280650.ref024"" ref-type=""bibr"">24</xref>]. A bunch of studies on LSDs reported not only lysosomal storage but also impairment of other cellular processes such as calcium homeostasis, lipid synthesis, and signaling pathways [<xref rid=""pone.0280650.ref024"" ref-type=""bibr"">24</xref>–<xref rid=""pone.0280650.ref026"" ref-type=""bibr"">26</xref>]. Owing to the essential role of lysosomes in autophagy, it was reasonable to expect that accumulated GM2 ganglioside in lysosomes of <italic toggle=""yes"">Hexa-/-Neu3-/-</italic> mice could have an effect on autophagic flux. However, the relation between accumulated GM2 ganglioside and the autophagy process has not been identified. In the present study, we investigated whether autophagic flux is altered in the brain of <italic toggle=""yes"">Hexa-/-Neu3-/-</italic> mice correlated with insufficient lysosomal due to accumulation of GM2 ganglioside. Beclin-1 activation is a marker of autophagy induction which triggers autophagore formation [<xref rid=""pone.0280650.ref027"" ref-type=""bibr"">27</xref>]. Although the elevated level of Beclin-1 has been shown in <italic toggle=""yes"">npc1-/-</italic> mice, fibroblasts of Niemann-Pick patients [<xref rid=""pone.0280650.ref027"" ref-type=""bibr"">27</xref>], and <italic toggle=""yes"">β-gal-/-</italic> mouse brain of GM1 gangliosidosis [<xref rid=""pone.0280650.ref012"" ref-type=""bibr"">12</xref>], the level of Beclin-1 has not changed in mice model of multiple sulphatase deficiency (MSD) and mucopolysaccharidosis type IIIA (MPS-IIIA) [<xref rid=""pone.0280650.ref006"" ref-type=""bibr"">6</xref>]. Here, we demonstrated that both mRNA and protein levels of Beclin-1 decreased in the hippocampus and cerebellum of 5-month-old <italic toggle=""yes"">Hexa-/-Neu3-/-</italic> mice (Figs <xref rid=""pone.0280650.g001"" ref-type=""fig"">1B</xref>, <xref rid=""pone.0280650.g002"" ref-type=""fig"">2F and 2L</xref>). In parallel, the lower expression of Atg9 was detected in the cortex (<xref rid=""pone.0280650.g001"" ref-type=""fig"">Fig 1D</xref>), cerebellum (<xref rid=""pone.0280650.g001"" ref-type=""fig"">Fig 1H</xref>), and thalamus (<xref rid=""pone.0280650.g001"" ref-type=""fig"">Fig 1L</xref>) of 5-month-old <italic toggle=""yes"">Hexa-/-Neu3-/-</italic> mice. These results indicate an alteration in autophagic pathway initiation. Autophagosome accumulation has also been reported in several types of LSDs including Danon disease [<xref rid=""pone.0280650.ref028"" ref-type=""bibr"">28</xref>], Pompe disease [<xref rid=""pone.0280650.ref013"" ref-type=""bibr"">13</xref>], mucolipidosis [<xref rid=""pone.0280650.ref014"" ref-type=""bibr"">14</xref>], and mucopolysaccharidoses type IIIA [<xref rid=""pone.0280650.ref006"" ref-type=""bibr"">6</xref>]. Increased autophagosome formation or decreased autophagosome-lysosome fusion could lead to autophagosome accumulation [<xref rid=""pone.0280650.ref006"" ref-type=""bibr"">6</xref>]. Consistent with previously reported studies, we demonstrated an elevated level of LC3-II in all brain regions of 5-month-old <italic toggle=""yes"">Hexa-/-Neu3-/-</italic> mice (Figs <xref rid=""pone.0280650.g004"" ref-type=""fig"">4C</xref> and <xref rid=""pone.0280650.g004"" ref-type=""fig"">4F</xref>, <xref rid=""pone.0280650.g004"" ref-type=""fig"">4I</xref>, <xref rid=""pone.0280650.g004"" ref-type=""fig"">4L</xref>, and <xref rid=""pone.0280650.g005"" ref-type=""fig"">5</xref>). These data suggest that <italic toggle=""yes"">Hexa-/-Neu3-/-</italic> mice have secondarily accumulated autophagosomes besides GM2 ganglioside accumulation. Furthermore, immunocytochemical analysis of LC3-Lamp1 colocalization also revealed elevated autophagolysosomes in <italic toggle=""yes"">Hexa-/-Neu3-/-</italic> mice (<xref rid=""pone.0280650.g005"" ref-type=""fig"">Fig 5</xref>). However, it is not clear whether the increase in LC3-Lamp1 colocalization is due to accumulated lysosomes or increased autophagolysosomes in <italic toggle=""yes"">Hexa-/-Neu3-/-</italic> mice. To clarify the mechanism of autophagosome-lysosome fusion, further investigations are required. Previously it was shown that the level of autophagy substrates, such as p62/SQSTM1 are significantly increased in several LDS indicating an impairment of the autophagic flux. p62/SQSTM1 protein, a component of ubiquitinated protein aggregates, is responsible for targeting polyubiquitinated proteins to autophagosomes [<xref rid=""pone.0280650.ref029"" ref-type=""bibr"">29</xref>] and degraded in the termination of the autophagic pathway along with autophagic cargo [<xref rid=""pone.0280650.ref030"" ref-type=""bibr"">30</xref>]. Accumulation of p62/SQSTM1 has been reported in the endosomal/lysosomal fraction of <italic toggle=""yes"">npc1-/-</italic> mouse brain lysates [<xref rid=""pone.0280650.ref031"" ref-type=""bibr"">31</xref>], cultured fibroblasts of Fabry patients [<xref rid=""pone.0280650.ref032"" ref-type=""bibr"">32</xref>], mucolipidosis type II, III [<xref rid=""pone.0280650.ref033"" ref-type=""bibr"">33</xref>] and type IV (MLIV) fibroblasts [<xref rid=""pone.0280650.ref034"" ref-type=""bibr"">34</xref>], muscle fibers of Pompe disease [<xref rid=""pone.0280650.ref035"" ref-type=""bibr"">35</xref>], and brain of Gaucher disease mice model [<xref rid=""pone.0280650.ref036"" ref-type=""bibr"">36</xref>]. Similarly, in our study, we showed accumulated p62/SQSTM1 in the brain of 5-month-old <italic toggle=""yes"">Hexa-/-Neu3-/-</italic> mice suggesting the impairment in the termination step of autophagic flux. Our knowledge of molecular and cellular mechanisms for Tay-Sachs disease is mostly limited to what we have learned from skin fibroblast and iPSCs obtained from patients with Tay-Sachs disease and recently generated mice model with combined deficiency of β-hexosaminidase A and neuraminidase 3. To our knowledge, this is the first study demonstrating progressive alterations in the autophagic flux in the brain tissue of mice with Tay-Sachs disease. Our findings provide insights into the dysregulation of autophagy in the brain and suggest a potential therapeutic approach to reduce lysosomal accumulation by targeting the regulation and activation of proper autophagy. However, further <italic toggle=""yes"">in vitro</italic> and <italic toggle=""yes"">in vivo</italic> studies are necessary to elucidate the precise molecular mechanisms underlying dysregulated autophagy in neurons and glial cells of the Tay-Sachs mice model.

"Biochemical and mutational analyses of <italic toggle=""yes"">HEXA</italic> in a cohort of Egyptian patients with infantile Tay-Sachs disease. Expansion of the mutation spectrum",,"Tay-Sachs disease (TSD) or GM2 gangliosidosis variant B (MIM: 272800) is a rare autosomal recessive neurodegenerative lysosomal storage disorder that is fatal in infancy. TSD is caused by mutations in the alpha-subunit <italic toggle=""yes"">HEXA</italic> gene (MIM# 606869) of β-hexosaminidase-A enzyme leading to deficiency of the enzyme activity and TSD phenotype. The main pathology of the disease is caused by the progressive accumulation of GM2 ganglioside and associated glycosphingolipids in the lysosomes, mainly that of the neurons promoting progressive neurodegeneration [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR1"">1</xref>]. The clinical presentation is classified according to the age of disease- onset into infantile, juvenile, and adult forms. The most severe form is the classical infantile TSD, which presents initially with motor weakness, increased startle response at 3–5 months of age, and is invariably associated with macular red spots. Neurological signs become increasingly evident with the loss of earlier achieved motor milestones, impaired vision, deafness, feeding problems and seizures. Further deterioration ends in an unresponsive vegetative state and death at 2–4 years of age. This fatal phenotype is common to all patients with deficient β-hexosaminidase-A activity. Later-onset TSD phenotypes are more clinically variable and are usually divided into juvenile and adult forms [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR2"">2</xref>]. Recently, an adeno-associated virus (AAV) gene therapy clinical trial to establish safety dosage and provide infantile TSD patients derived data has shown promising results of a time-limited disease stabilization [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR3"">3</xref>]. TSD disease showed a particularly high incidence in the Ashkenazi Jewish population with a carrier frequency of approximately 1 in 25 compared to 1/250–300 in most other populations. Also, the incidence of patients affected by the disease is estimated to be 1 in 3600 live births in Ashkenazi Jewish versus 1 in 360,000 in other populations worldwide [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR4"">4</xref>, <xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR5"">5</xref>]. Population-based carrier screening programs in the United States and Canada reduce the incidence of TSD by more than 90% in these populations [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR6"">6</xref>, <xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR7"">7</xref>]. To date > 220 <italic toggle=""yes"">HEXA</italic> mutations were identified in the Tay-Sachs mutation database [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR8"">8</xref>, <xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR9"">9</xref>], <italic toggle=""yes"">HEXA</italic> mutations may impact the protein’s structure, folding, and/or transport, which ultimately leads to functional impairment [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR10"">10</xref>, <xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR11"">11</xref>]. Ethnic-related common gene mutations have been reported in Ashkenazi Jews patients, in 94–98% of them, TSD is caused by one of three common mutations; c.1277_1278 ins TATC in exon 11, 1421 + 1 G > C transition at the splice junction of exon/intron 12 and c.805 G > A (p.G269S) [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR12"">12</xref>]. Non-Ashkenazi TSD patients exhibited rare mutations distributed all over the HEXA gene [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR13"">13</xref>, <xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR14"">14</xref>]. In the present study, we were aiming to reveal the <italic toggle=""yes"">HEXA</italic> mutations’ spectrum and genotypes in Egyptian patients with the infantile form of TSD. Bidirectional direct Sanger sequencing analysis of the entire coding region and splice junctions of the gene was our implemented approach.   TSD patients ascertained in the present study displayed developmental delay, hypotonia, loss of motor milestones, seizures, deafness, and the presence of a cherry red spot in fundus examination. The markedly reduced Hex-A enzyme activity (mean 3 µmol/L/h ± 1.56) has confirmed the diagnosis of TSD. This study is the first to uncover the <italic toggle=""yes"">HEXA</italic> mutations’ spectrum and correlate the β-hexosaminidase-A enzyme deficiency to the underlying <italic toggle=""yes"">HEXA</italic> molecular defects in a homogeneous population of Egyptian patients with the infantile form of TSD. The sequencing technology applied here, Sanger sequencing of the coding and splice junction regions of the gene enabled the identification of the molecular defect in ~ 62% of patients enrolled, in two of them a single mutant allele was detected. While in ~ 38%, the molecular pathology remained undiagnosed. The characteristics of patients 1 and 3 in whom the same recurrent mutation c.1510C > T(R504C), as well as the two polymorphic benign alleles, c.1306A > G (I436V) and c.1551G > A (E417E) were all in heterozygous genotypes seem interesting. It may suggest a potential haplotype of the TSD disease-causing mutation (in exon13) and two common variants in exons 11&13. This heterozygous haplotype may result from an associated chromosomal rearrangement events. It will be interesting to investigate potential cytogenetic events in these two patients, the outcome may support a different mechanism of the molecular pathology that underlies the TSD clinical and biochemical phenotype. The molecular defect in P8, born to a consanguineous family and had a confirmed Hex-A enzyme deficiency, remains unresolved. Three variants were detected in this patient; the heterozygous missense variant c.8G > C (S3T) that was classified as likely benign, however of a rare frequency (ƒ = 0.00046 in gnomAD exomes), and the two frequently occurring variants in exons 11&13, both were in a homozygous genotype. The same situation of the unrevealed genetic defect was encountered in four patients (P10-13) in whom only the polymorphic variants in exons 11&13 and a silent amino acid change in P11 were detected in their blood derived DNA. <italic toggle=""yes"">HEXA</italic> is the only gene, up to date, described in association with TSD, this highlights the importance of NGS technology, WGS, for the detection of the full spectrum of the associated disease-causing variants involving intragenic, deep intronic or copy number variations in TSD patients that proved mutations’ negative in Sanger sequencing. NGS will also facilitate the differential diagnosis promoted by the notable clinical overlap seen in the clinic among infants and children presented with a phenotype suggestive of neurometabolic or neurodegenerative storage diseases. To date, more than 220 HEXA mutations were reported causing different forms of TSD. Documented mutations involved single-base substitutions, small deletions, small duplications/insertions, partial gene deletions, splicing alterations, and complex gene rearrangements [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR8"">8</xref>, <xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR9"">9</xref>, <xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR17"">17</xref>, <xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR18"">18</xref>]. Mutations detected in the infantile form of TSD are generally located in residues proximal to or involve a functionally important active site or dimer interface [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR21"">21</xref>, <xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR22"">22</xref>]. Among the six disease-causing mutations identified in this study, three were originally detected in our patients [E307A, H318D, and E162Rfs*37] and another three have been previously reported [R504C, R504H, and R499C] in different ethnic populations pointing out their diversity. [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR23"">23</xref>–<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR28"">28</xref>]. Mutations in exon 13 [R504C, R504H, and R499C] constitute 38.4% of the mutations detected in the present cohort of Egyptian patients (5/13) with infantile TSD, whereas missense mutations in exon 8 [H318D and E307A] present 15.4%. The nucleotide deletion in exon 5 [c.484delG] constitutes 7.7%. These sequencing findings lead us to suggest <italic toggle=""yes"">HEXA</italic>-exon13 as the first candidate for molecular screening in Egyptian patients with infantile TSD. The novel missense c.952C > G mutation (H318D) in exon 8, homozygous in P6, falls within residues 192–402 of the enzyme’s alpha subunit. These residues were found to be involved in the hydrolysis of the GM2-ganglioside [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR29"">29</xref>]. Histidine residue is the most common amino acid involved in protein active sites [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR30"">30</xref>]. His318 residue is located within four residues forming D322, a potential active site. A mutation at this site leads to abnormal protein retention and degradation within the endoplasmic reticulum [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR31"">31</xref>]. A missense mutation involving  the same codon H318 was reported in non-Jewish TSD carrier from Germany; however, the substitution was for Arginine H318R [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR32"">32</xref>]. The 2nd novel mutation in exon 8, glutamate substitution for alanine (E307A) at codon 920 was homozygous in P7. Glutamate is a negatively charged, polar amino acid that is frequently involved in protein active sites. Alanine is a non-polar small-size residue with a very short non-reactive side chain. Substitution of a small side chain for a large one can be damaging [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR30"">30</xref>]. Studies that investigated the <italic toggle=""yes"">HEXA</italic> mutations affecting the α-subunit candidate active site residues, reported the occurrence of severe impairments of the enzyme catalytic activity, which was found to interfere with α-subunit maturation, when introducing substitution of E307 to another residue [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR33"">33</xref>]. A missense mutation at the same 307codon exchanging amino acid glutamate into lysine (E307K) was  previously reported in association with TSD, further supporting the pathogenicity of E307A [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR34"">34</xref>]. The homozygous base pair deletion, c.484 delG, the first base in codon 162 (gAG) in exon 5 of P9, originally described here, leads to a frameshift and premature stop codon and apparently early mediated decay of the encoded protein. The S3T missense heterozygous variant detected in P8 is positioned as part of the residues of α-subunit that seems to have a role in the enzyme activity against the specific sulfated substrate 4MUGS. S3T has been detected in a screening study for TSD carriers [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR35"">35</xref>]. Earlier studies demonstrated these two domain-residues of α1-191 and α 403-529 to account for enzyme activity against 4MUGS [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR29"">29</xref>]. However, other investigators pointed residues 1–131 as not being involved in binding the negatively charged substrates, instead, they suggested residues 132–283 as the α-subunit negatively charged substrates-binding site [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR36"">36</xref>]. The recurrent R499C mutation was identified as homozygous in P5, the substitution is likely to interrupt the specific disulfide bond and disrupt the three-dimensional structure of the enzyme [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR37"">37</xref>]. The other two mutations R504H and R504C affect the ability of the alpha subunit to dimerize. R504C was detected as heterozygous in P1 & P3 and homozygous in P2. R504H was homozygous in P4. R504 of the α-subunit directly binds to D494 of the β-subunit in the α-β heterodimer model. Substitution of R504 to C or H causes a disruption of that binding leading to conformational changes in the dimer interface [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR38"">38</xref>]. Frequent recurrence of Arg to His/Cys substitution at positions 499 and 504 is probably a consequence of a mutagenic hot spot of the CpG dinucleotides [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR29"">29</xref>, <xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR33"">33</xref>]. The polymorphic variants I436V and E506E were detected in 91% of our patients and control subjects. I436V was frequently reported in normal American black population [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR14"">14</xref>, <xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR39"">39</xref>], and also found to occur at high frequency among Ethiopian Jews (heterozygotes frequency: 26.1%), while at a lower frequency in Jewish from eight populations, Iraq, Syria, Tunis, Morocco, Libya, Yemen, Persia and Eastern Europe (1.5–7.0%) [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR40"">40</xref>]. In this study, 77% of patients were the product of consanguineous marriages. The cConsanguinity rate in Egypt reported to be above 30% throughout the last 40 years [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR41"">41</xref>]. In an earlier biochemical study, 58% of Egyptian patients with GM2 gangliosidosis were diagnosed as Tay Sachs disease by enzymatic assay. Parental consanguinity was present in 73.3% of these cases. [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR42"">42</xref>]. Consanguinity is a principal factor in increasing the incidence of rare autosomal recessive diseases among the Arab population. The incidence of Tay-Sachs disease has been markedly reduced by more than 90% since the introduction of carrier screening and counseling in Jewish population in comparison to the non-Jewish who is now at 3–4-fold higher frequency [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR6"">6</xref>, <xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR7"">7</xref>]. The <italic toggle=""yes"">HEXA</italic> mutations R504C, R504H, and R499C are confirmed as being not specific to the Jewish population but of a diverse background. The novel mutations E307A, H318D, and E162Rfs*37 may be specific to Egyptian or Arab TSD patients, hence additional studies in Arab and Middle East populations are highly recommended for the delineation of unique ethnic-related disease-causing variants. The findings of this study suggest Sanger sequencing of <italic toggle=""yes"">HEXA</italic>-exon 13, as the first screening mutational target in suspected TSD Egyptian patients. Mutation identification in a proband will be the basic measure in the prevention of TSD recurrence in Egyptian families, the reason the NGS should be considered in patients with negative Sanger sequencing results.",N/A,13 3 2023

Gene expression changes in Tay-Sachs disease begin early in fetal brain development,"Treatment of monogenic disorders has historically relied on symptomatic management with limited ability to target primary molecular deficits. However, recent advances in gene therapy and related technologies aim to correct these underlying deficiencies, raising the possibility of disease management or even prevention for diseases that can be treated pre-symptomatically. Tay-Sachs disease (TSD) would be one such candidate, however very little is known about the presymptomatic stage of TSD. To better understand the effects of TSD on brain development, we evaluated the transcriptomes of human fetal brain samples with biallelic pathogenic variants in <italic toggle=""yes"">HEXA</italic>. We identified dramatic changes in the transcriptome, suggesting a perturbation of normal development. We also observed a shift in the expression of the sphingolipid metabolic pathway away from production of the HEXA substrate, GM2 ganglioside, presumptively to compensate for dysfunction of the enzyme. However, we do not observe transcriptomic signatures of end stage disease, suggesting that developmental perturbations precede neurodegeneration. To our knowledge, this is the first report of the relationship between fetal disease pathology in juvenile onset TSD and the analysis of gene expression in fetal TSD tissues. This study highlights the need to better understand the “pre-symptomatic” stage of disease in order to set realistic expectations for patients receiving early therapeutic intervention.",Full text not available in PMC,N/A,8 2 2023
Late-Onset Tay-Sachs Disease - expanding the clinical phenotype,,Full text not available in PMC,N/A,31 1 2023
Diagnostic Tips from a Video Series and Literature Review of Patients with Late-Onset Tay-Sachs Disease,,"In 1881 Dr. Warren Tay first described a severe early onset neurodegenerative disease associated with the appearance of a “cherry red spot” in the retina of infants with Ashkenazi Jewish (AJ) ancestry. In 1887, Bernard Sachs named it “amaurotic family idiocy”. It was only in 1910 that accumulation of a “lipoid substances” in the ganglionic cells was noticed associated with a “peculiar balloon-like swelling of the dendrites” [<xref rid=""B1"" ref-type=""bibr"">1</xref>]. This disorder was later renamed Tay-Sachs disease (TSD) and it was found to be a result of the deficiency of the isoform A of the hexosaminidase enzyme (HEXA) [<xref rid=""B2"" ref-type=""bibr"">2</xref>]. The gene encoding this enzyme, <italic toggle=""yes"">HEXA</italic>, was identified in the late 1980s [<xref rid=""B3"" ref-type=""bibr"">3</xref><xref rid=""B4"" ref-type=""bibr"">4</xref>]. In the same years, later onset forms of HEXA deficiency were described in older infants and children, leading to the characterization of various sub-types of TSD: “late infantile”, “juvenile” and “late onset” [<xref rid=""B5"" ref-type=""bibr"">5</xref><xref rid=""B6"" ref-type=""bibr"">6</xref>]. GM<sub>2</sub> gangliosidoses are caused by a deficiency of the beta-hexosaminidase enzyme, a dimeric enzyme consisting of co-enzymes HEXA and HEXB, critical to the degradation of GM<sub>2</sub> gangliosides. Mutations in either co-enzymes can lead to progressive neurologic degeneration due to accumulation of the GM<sub>2</sub> ganglioside in the lysosomes of neurons [<xref rid=""B7"" ref-type=""bibr"">7</xref>]. TSD is caused by biallelic mutations of <italic toggle=""yes"">HEXA</italic> on chromosome 15. More than 170 pathogenic variants of <italic toggle=""yes"">HEXA</italic> have been described so far [<xref rid=""B8"" ref-type=""bibr"">8</xref>]. “Milder” variants (G269S or W474C) are usually associated with later onset forms while other genetic variants (i.e. c.1278insTATC, c.1073+1G3>A, R499H) are responsible for earlier disease onset and severe phenotypes [<xref rid=""B9"" ref-type=""bibr"">9</xref>]. The disease is highly prevalent among the AJ population, where the carrier frequency is 1 in 31 people [<xref rid=""B10"" ref-type=""bibr"">10</xref>]. The clinical phenotype of the classical form of TSD presents usually after the first 6 months of life and rapidly progresses. Symptoms are limited to the central nervous system, manifesting with pyramidal signs, seizures and psychomotor regression with death by the age of 5 years. In the juvenile form, patients can survive into the second decade, while the late onset phenotypes is usually characterized by onset in the second or third decade. Although leucocyte HEXA activity is reduced in older patients, this is usually higher compared to the levels reported in the infants affected with the classical TSD. The juvenile and adult onset forms – collectively termed late onset Tay-Sachs disease (LOTS) – are much less well known to clinicians. Adult patients are frequently diagnosed very late in the course of the disease, typically after several misdiagnoses [<xref rid=""B11"" ref-type=""bibr"">11</xref>]. Depending on the predominant symptoms at onset, LOTS patients will be usually initially assessed either by Movement Disorders or Neuromuscular specialists, or by psychiatrists. It is important for clinicians to recognize LOTS to shorten the diagnostic journey for these patients, avoid expensive and invasive diagnostic tests (i.e. muscle biopsy, lumbar puncture, etc.), and provide proper monitoring and surveillance for the patient (i.e. screen for co-morbid psychiatric disorders). In addition, there is significant ongoing investigations to find disease modifying therapies for all forms of TSD [<xref rid=""B12"" ref-type=""bibr"">12</xref>]. The earlier the recognition of the disease and the higher the chance of preventing further irreversible neuronal degeneration, once treatments will be available. Here, we will present a case series of nine patients affected with LOTS and include a video presentation of the most characteristic features. We will offer practical diagnostic tips to help clinicians recognize this rare but distinctive disorder. We collected and characterized a population of LOTS cases. Through chart review, we noted their demographic data, family history, clinical features (including age of onset, age at diagnosis, first symptoms, past medical and surgical history), genetic and metabolic tests, brain imaging and physical examination. Patients were also videotaped after informed consent was obtained. Literature reviewed included Pubmed search of articles up to June 2022, utilizing combinations of the following searching terms: “Late-Onset Tay-Sachs”, “LOTS”, “Tay-Sachs”, “HEXA”, “hexosaminidase”, “amaurotic family idiocy”, “GM<sub>2</sub> gangliosidoses”, “late onset”, “juvenile”, “neuromuscular”, “motoneuron”, “psychiatric”, “psychosis”, “cerebellar”, “ataxia”, “stuttering”, “dystonia”, parkinsonism”, “movement disorder”. Clinical and demographic traits of the subjects described in the literature were collected by the authors and summarized in <xref rid=""T1"" ref-type=""table"">Table 1</xref> and <xref rid=""T2"" ref-type=""table"">2</xref>. Only articles available in English were considered.  Classical TSD is a devastating neurodegenerative disorders, leading to death within the first few years of life and is easily recognized. However, the existence of attenuated forms of TSD, which can present in the first decade in life or later, prove to be a diagnostic challenge for both patients and clinicians [<xref rid=""B55"" ref-type=""bibr"">55</xref>]. Patients with LOTS manifest a wide spectrum of phenotypes, resembling motor neuron diseases, cerebellar degeneration, and/or psychiatric disorders. A large, previously described cohort of patients defined the natural history of this disorder [<xref rid=""B11"" ref-type=""bibr"">11</xref>]. Due to its rarity and heterogenous presentations, LOTS is frequently undiagnosed or recognized only long after the onset of the symptoms. Because a growing number of potential disease modifying therapies are under evaluation for LOTS, it is now becoming critical to promptly recognize this disorder. LOTS should be added to the list of differential diagnosis of anterior horn cell disorders, neuromuscular diseases, or ataxias, as well as in the event of acute onset of psychosis or mood disorders in young adults. A general overview of the reported cases suggest that the onset of the disease may occur between the first and the third decade, although an attentive revision of patient’s clinical history often highlighted the disease’s subtle hallmarks earlier in life. This suggests that maybe the real watershed between the juvenile and late onset TSD is the severity of the progression of the symptoms across the second and third decade rather than the age of onset of the first manifestations. In the majority of the cases speech impairment, with a characteristic accelerated speech, can be present in the earliest school years requiring the assistance of speech therapy. Interestingly, clinical manifestations seem to be consistent among patients in the same family. Cerebellar symptoms usually present earlier (in the first decade), followed by neuromuscular manifestations (second decade), and psychiatric symptoms (second-third decade) [<xref rid=""B11"" ref-type=""bibr"">11</xref>]. Compared to other lysosomal storage disorders, such as Gaucher disease, there is no report of systemic involvement of this disorder [<xref rid=""B56"" ref-type=""bibr"">56</xref>]. It is also worth noticing that the typical cherry red spot, usually detected as a characteristic sign of the classical, early onset form of the disease is not present among LOTS patients, who instead manifest eye movement abnormalities, mostly affecting the saccadic phases. Despite the different clinical pictures, brain MRI always consistently shows cerebellar atrophy, even when cerebellar signs are not prominent. In the majority of cases there is a gradual progression of the symptoms, with a step by step involvement of the different systems. Besides considering the broad spectrum of presentations of the disease, some other tips may be helpful to suspect LOTS such as the characteristic proximal weakness (particularly affecting the triceps in the upper limbs), the accelerated speech, a significant impulsivity often leading them to dangerous choice in life or predisposing them to frequent falls when gait is more compromised (<xref rid=""F2"" ref-type=""fig"">Figure 2</xref>). The present work has the limitation of being a retrospective analysis of reported cases. Some of the symptoms may be underestimated due to underreporting rather than absence of the features. However, this reasoned review of the literature, together with the analysis of our cohort of patients and their video presentation will offer a solid base to help clinicians identify LOTS earlier thereby preventing unnecessary tests and diagnostic assessments, as well as allow better counseling to the patient, and opening the possibility of earlier and more effective therapeutic intervention when it becomes available.",N/A,27 12 2022
Analysis of Brain Lipids in the Early-Onset Tay–Sachs Disease Mouse Model With the Combined Deficiency of β-Hexosaminidase A and Neuraminidase 3,"
<bold>Introduction:</bold> Tay–Sachs disease is an autosomal recessively inherited lysosomal storage disease that results from loss-of-function mutations in the <italic toggle=""yes"">HEXA</italic> gene coding β-hexosaminidase A. <italic toggle=""yes"">HEXA</italic> gene deficiency affects the central nervous system owing to GM2 ganglioside accumulation in lysosomes resulting in progressive neurodegeneration in patients. We recently generated a novel mice model with a combined deficiency of β-hexosaminidase A and neuraminidase 3 (<italic toggle=""yes"">Hexa−/−Neu3−/−</italic>) that mimics both the neuropathological and clinical abnormalities of early-onset Tay–Sachs disease. Here, we aimed to explore the secondary accumulation of lipids in the brain of <italic toggle=""yes"">Hexa−/−Neu3−/−</italic> mice. 
<bold>Materials and Methods:</bold> In the cortex and hippocampus of five-month-old <italic toggle=""yes"">WT</italic>, <italic toggle=""yes"">Hexa−/−</italic>, <italic toggle=""yes"">Neu3−/−</italic>, and <italic toggle=""yes"">Hexa−/−Neu3−/−</italic> mice, lipid levels belonging to glycerolipids, glycerophospholipids, and sterol lipids were evaluated using a shotgun lipidomics approach. The levels of myelin were also assessed by luxol fast blue staining and immunohistochemistry using antibodies against myelin basic protein. We further examined glycoconjugate and cholesterol levels by periodic acid–Schiff and filipin staining, respectively. Toluidine blue staining was also performed to display axonal degeneration. 
<bold>Results:</bold> Among glycerophospholipids, we demonstrated elevated levels of phosphatidylcholine-ether and lysophosphatidylcholine while decreased levels of phosphatidylcholine and phosphatidylserine in both cortex and hippocampus of <italic toggle=""yes"">Hexa−/−Neu3−/−</italic> mice. In the glycerolipid class, we showed an alleviated level of sphingomyelin in both cortex and hippocampus, but the higher levels of diacylglycerol and triacylglycerol were detected in only the hippocampus of <italic toggle=""yes"">Hexa−/−Neu3−/−</italic> mice. The lower level of sterol was also detected in the cortex of <italic toggle=""yes"">Hexa−/−Neu3−/−</italic> mice but not in the hippocampus. Histochemical studies showed a decrease in the myelin level and axonal degeneration indicating neuronal pathology in the brain of <italic toggle=""yes"">Hexa−/−Neu3−/−</italic> mice. Although glycoconjugate accumulation was evident both in the cortex and hippocampus, we did not detect any changes in the level of cholesterol. 
<bold>Conclusion:</bold> Our results indicate that alterations in lipid metabolism and neuropathology, such as demyelination and axonal degeneration, might be related to the dysfunctionality of lipid-related cellular pathways like autophagy. Understanding of brain-specific lipid alterations contributes to evaluating the effectiveness of treatments in <italic toggle=""yes"">Hexa−/−Neu3−/−</italic> mice in future studies.","The GM2 gangliosidoses are lysosomal storage diseases that include Tay–Sachs disease (TSD), Sandhoff disease (SD), and GM2 activator deficiency (GM2AP) (<xref rid=""B28"" ref-type=""bibr"">Platt et al., 2012</xref>). TSD is caused by mutations in the α subunit of heterodimeric enzyme β-hexosaminidase A (HEXA), which is responsible for the conversion of GM2 to GM3 ganglioside (<xref rid=""B39"" ref-type=""bibr"">Yamanaka et al., 1994</xref>). Abnormal GM2 accumulation due to HEXA results in loss of motor function, seizures, developmental impairments, and death in infants with TSD (<xref rid=""B35"" ref-type=""bibr"">Triggs-Raine et al., 2001</xref>). There are no approved therapies, and the current standard of care is not effective at managing seizures or improving mental and motor deficits. The generation of a suitable mouse model is important for the study of TSD pathogenesis and the development of potential treatments. Unexpectedly, <italic toggle=""yes"">Hexa−/−</italic> mice did not show any abnormal phenotype and are clinically indistinguishable from wild-type mice until at least 1 year of age (<xref rid=""B39"" ref-type=""bibr"">Yamanaka et al., 1994</xref>; <xref rid=""B26"" ref-type=""bibr"">Phaneuf et al., 1996</xref>). Recently, a mutant mouse line depleted for both Hexa and Neu3 genes (<italic toggle=""yes"">Hexa−/−Neu3−/−)</italic> has been generated to understand the metabolic bypass mechanism in the ganglioside pathway. These mice showed progressive GM2 ganglioside accumulation and clinical, biochemical, and pathological abnormalities seen in Tay–Sachs patients (<xref rid=""B30"" ref-type=""bibr"">Seyrantepe et al., 2018</xref>). Therefore, the <italic toggle=""yes"">Hexa−/−Neu3−/−</italic> mice model is suitable for further investigation of disease pathologies associated with early-onset TSD. Lipids underlie important cellular events such as cell membrane formation, cellular transport, and energy storage (<xref rid=""B21"" ref-type=""bibr"">Liu et al., 2021</xref>). In addition to structural roles, lipids in the nervous system have also been shown to contribute to several functions including synaptogenesis, impulse conduction, and myelin sheath maintenance (<xref rid=""B6"" ref-type=""bibr"">Cermenati et al., 2015</xref>). There are eight distinct subgroups of lipids; fatty acyls, glycerolipids, glycerophospholipids, sphingolipids, sterol lipids, prenol lipids, saccharolipids, and polyketides (<xref rid=""B32"" ref-type=""bibr"">Stephenson et al., 2017</xref>). Among them, cholesterol, sphingolipids, and glycerophospholipids are critical in maintaining homeostatic balance, neuronal membrane architecture, and proper neurodevelopment and function (<xref rid=""B13"" ref-type=""bibr"">Fuller and Futerman, 2018</xref>). Secondary accumulation of any of the three major classes in neurodegeneration is underscored by the number of LSDs including Gaucher disease (reviewed by <xref rid=""B38"" ref-type=""bibr"">Walkley and Vanier, 2009</xref>; <xref rid=""B13"" ref-type=""bibr"">Fuller and Futerman, 2018</xref>; <xref rid=""B4"" ref-type=""bibr"">Breiden and Sandhoff, 2020</xref>). In addition to cholesterol and glycosaminoglycan accumulation, which are the hallmarks of Niemann–Pick disease (NPD) and mucopolysaccharidoses (MPSs), secondary accumulation of GM2 and GM3 gangliosides also contributes to disease neuropathologies of NPD (<xref rid=""B38"" ref-type=""bibr"">Walkley and Vanier, 2009</xref>). In this study, we aimed to clarify the secondary alteration of lipids in the brain of <italic toggle=""yes"">Hexa−/−Neu3−/−</italic> mice by shotgun lipidome analysis. We also analyzed neuropathology in the brain of <italic toggle=""yes"">Hexa−/−Neu3−/−</italic> mice to clarify demyelination and axonal degeneration processes using immunohistochemical and histopathological analyses.   We previously generated <italic toggle=""yes"">Hexa−/−Neu3−/−</italic> mice that mimics the early-onset phenotype of TSD. In those mice, severe neurological abnormalities such as tremors and ataxia are observed. Similar to patients with TSD, <italic toggle=""yes"">Hexa−/−Neu3−/−</italic> mice also have growth impairment, short lifespan, progressive neurodegeneration, and behavioral defects. Primary accumulation of GM2, which is the hallmark of GM2 gangliosidosis, is observed in the <italic toggle=""yes"">Hexa−/−Neu3−/−</italic> mice model. In addition to GM2, secondary accumulation of glycosphingolipids such as GA2, GM3, and LacCer has been reported in five-month-old <italic toggle=""yes"">Hexa−/− Neu3−/−</italic> mouse brains (<xref rid=""B30"" ref-type=""bibr"">Seyrantepe et al., 2018</xref>). To address whether <italic toggle=""yes"">Hexa−/−Neu3−/−</italic> mice have other alterations in brain lipid, glycerophospholipids, glycerolipids, and sterol lipids were analyzed by shotgun lipidomics. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study that shows lipid alterations in two brain regions from an early-onset TSD mice model. Secondary accumulation of glycosphingolipids has been demonstrated in several LSDs. Patients with NP type A and C disease showed increased levels of GM2 ganglioside in the brain (<xref rid=""B9"" ref-type=""bibr"">Crocker, 1961</xref>; <xref rid=""B10"" ref-type=""bibr"">Cumings, 1962</xref>). Reduced levels of GD1a and GM1 along with increased levels of GD2, GD3, and GM3 gangliosides were also observed in the cerebral cortex and white matter of children who have Krabbe’s disease (<xref rid=""B37"" ref-type=""bibr"">Vanier and Svennerholm, 1975</xref>). As with other LSDs, brain specimens of Gaucher patients have increased levels of GM2 and GM3 gangliosides (<xref rid=""B25"" ref-type=""bibr"">Nilsson and Svennerholm, 1982</xref>). Similarly, secondary accumulation of GM2 and GM3 gangliosides have been reported in several MPS patients and MPS mice models (<xref rid=""B7"" ref-type=""bibr"">Constantopoulos and Dekaban, 1978</xref>). In addition, similar changes have been reported in NPC1- and NPC2-deficient mice models. Lipidomics analysis of NPC1-KO cells revealed the presence of several glycerophospholipids and other lipids in lysosomes (<xref rid=""B34"" ref-type=""bibr"">Tharkeshwar et al., 2017</xref>). Deregulated sphingolipid metabolism leads to an abnormal sphingolipid profile causing several events associated with the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases (<xref rid=""B27"" ref-type=""bibr"">Piccinini et al., 2010</xref>). Among the neurodegenerative disorders, altered lipid metabolism has been reported in both Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s diseases. One study has shown reduced levels of PC, PI, and PE glycerophospholipids in the serum of Alzheimer’s patients (<xref rid=""B18"" ref-type=""bibr"">Kikuchi et al., 2002</xref>). Similarly, glycerophospholipids were also low in brain specimens of patients with Parkinson’s disease. Our shotgun lipidomics data revealed a reduced level of PC, PI, and PE glycerophospholipids in the cortex of <italic toggle=""yes"">Hexa−/−Neu3−/−</italic> mice, but only a decreased level of PC (<xref rid=""F2"" ref-type=""fig"">Figure 2A</xref>) was detected in the hippocampus. Moreover, human brain tissues of Alzheimer’s disease and Parkinson’s disease had decreased levels of SM as well as increased levels of Cer (<xref rid=""B12"" ref-type=""bibr"">Fraser et al., 2010</xref>; <xref rid=""B22"" ref-type=""bibr"">Mesa-Herrera et al., 2019</xref>). Similarly, our data showed reduced levels of SM in both brain regions of <italic toggle=""yes"">Hexa−/−Neu3−/−</italic> mice. On the other hand, reduced levels of Cer were only observed in the cortex of <italic toggle=""yes"">Hexa−/−Neu3−/−</italic> mice but not in the hippocampus. The high levels of BMP, an isomer of PG, were reported in several LSDs such as NP, Gaucher, Fabry, and MPS I and II (<xref rid=""B36"" ref-type=""bibr"">Vanier 1983</xref>; <xref rid=""B2"" ref-type=""bibr"">Akgoc et al., 2015</xref>). In addition, a severe increase in BMP levels as a secondary accumulated lipid has been shown in brain samples of GM1 and GM2 gangliosidosis patients (<xref rid=""B2"" ref-type=""bibr"">Akgoc et al., 2015</xref>). We found a significantly elevated level of PG as an isomer of BMP only in the hippocampus of <italic toggle=""yes"">Hexa−/−Neu3−/−</italic> mice. Elevated levels of lyso-GM2 were shown in brain specimens from Tay–Sachs and Sandhoff disease patients. Altered phospholipid metabolism was also demonstrated in neuronal tissues of the Sandhoff disease mouse model. In addition to neurodegeneration, decreased levels of phospholipid synthesis are correlated with neuropathology in Sandhoff disease (<xref rid=""B5"" ref-type=""bibr"">Buccoliero et al., 2004</xref>). In Sandhoff mice, there was an increased level of lyso-GM2 in the brain and plasma compared to <italic toggle=""yes"">WT</italic> mice (<xref rid=""B19"" ref-type=""bibr"">Kodama et al., 2011</xref>). However, the levels of lyso-GM2 were not detectable in brain tissues of <italic toggle=""yes"">Hexa−/−Neu3−/−</italic> mouse. NP disease is associated with the accumulation of cholesterol and other lipids in late endosomes/lysosomes (<xref rid=""B38"" ref-type=""bibr"">Walkley and Vanier., 2009</xref>). To check the secondary effects of GM2 accumulation on cholesterol metabolism, the amounts of unesterified cholesterol were visualized by filipin labeling. However, we found that the unesterified cholesterol level did not significantly change in the <italic toggle=""yes"">Hexa−/−Neu3−/−</italic> mouse brain<italic toggle=""yes"">.</italic>
 The myelin sheath in the central nervous system is specifically formed in oligodendrocytes. In the previous study, we demonstrated that abnormal GM2 accumulation in the brain of <italic toggle=""yes"">Hexa−/−Neu3−/−</italic> mouse also causes the death of myelin-forming cells (<xref rid=""B11"" ref-type=""bibr"">Demir et al., 2020</xref>). Here, our shotgun lipidomics data showed a significant decrease in the level of SMs in both the cortex and hippocampus. The disruption of the myelin sheath was also confirmed by staining with anti-MBP and LFB. These results are consistent with other studies (<xref rid=""B3"" ref-type=""bibr"">Baek et al., 2009</xref>). Gene expression profile studies showed that the myelin basic protein gene was significantly lower in the cerebral cortex of GM2 gangliosidosis (Tay–Sachs and Sandhoff) patients than healthy individuals (<xref rid=""B24"" ref-type=""bibr"">Myerowitz et al., 2002</xref>). Axons of the cortical neurons in the five-month-old <italic toggle=""yes"">Hexa−/−Neu3−/−</italic> mice were significantly defected. <xref rid=""B17"" ref-type=""bibr"">Jackman et al. (2009</xref>) showed that sialylated gangliosides, especially GD1a and GT1b, are present on the axonal membrane and interact with the myelin-associated glycoprotein on the periaxonal surface to promote myelin sheath stability. Thus, we speculate that abnormal accumulation of GM2 as a sialic acid-containing ganglioside most likely leads to instability of the myelin sheath and axonal degeneration in the brain of the TSD mouse model. Lipids are important components of biological membranes, and they are involved in several cellular processes including autophagy, apoptosis, and cellular stress (<xref rid=""B31"" ref-type=""bibr"">Singh et al., 2009</xref>). Recent work indicates the important role of lipids in autophagic flux. For instance, Cer has a regulatory role in the initiation, maturation, and termination of autophagy (<xref rid=""B14"" ref-type=""bibr"">Hernandez-Diaz and Soukup, 2020</xref>). On the other hand, conjugation of LC3 and PE on the phagophore is a key step of autophagy, and PE supplementation reduced accumulated endogenous substances including amyloid precursor protein and α-synuclein in cultured neurons and SGPL1-knockout mice, respectively (<xref rid=""B23"" ref-type=""bibr"">Mitroi et al., 2017</xref>). Moreover, it has been demonstrated that the accumulation of SM in endosomes damages the maturation of autophagosomes (<xref rid=""B8"" ref-type=""bibr"">Corcelle-Termeau et al., 2016</xref>). In addition, the protective effect of TAG biosynthesis in apoptosis has been shown (<xref rid=""B20"" ref-type=""bibr"">Li et al., 2018</xref>). In our study, we observed alterations in several lipids, such as PE, Cer, SM, and TAG, in brain regions of <italic toggle=""yes"">Hexa−/−Neu3−/−</italic> mice that might be linked to the dysfunctionality of lipid-related cellular pathways including autophagy and apoptosis. We suggest that further studies are necessary to clarify the relationship between altered lipid profiles and cellular events such as autophagy and apoptosis in the early-onset TSD mice model. Taken together, our results clearly provide the first <italic toggle=""yes"">in vivo</italic> evidence that the brain of the TSD mouse model has additional alterations in lipid metabolism. Therefore, we suggest that having lipidome evaluation may lead to a detailed understanding of alterations in different lipid-driven mechanisms such as autophagy in TS and other lysosomal storage diseases.",N/A,08 8 2022

sp<sup>2</sup>-Iminosugars targeting human lysosomal β-hexosaminidase as pharmacological chaperone candidates for late-onset Tay-Sachs disease,"The late-onset form of Tay-Sachs disease displays when the activity levels of human β-hexosaminidase A (HexA) fall below 10% of normal, due to mutations that destabilise the native folded form of the enzyme and impair its trafficking to the lysosome. Competitive inhibitors of HexA can rescue disease-causative mutant HexA, bearing potential as pharmacological chaperones, but often also inhibit the enzyme O-glucosaminidase (GlcNAcase; OGA), a serious drawback for translation into the clinic. We have designed sp<sup>2</sup>-iminosugar glycomimetics related to GalNAc that feature a neutral piperidine-derived thiourea or a basic piperidine-thiazolidine bicyclic core and behave as selective nanomolar competitive inhibitors of human Hex A at pH 7 with a ten-fold lower inhibitory potency at pH 5, a good indication for pharmacological chaperoning. They increased the levels of lysosomal HexA activity in Tay-Sachs patient fibroblasts having the G269S mutation, the highest prevalent in late-onset Tay-Sachs disease.","<italic toggle=""yes"">N</italic>-Acetyl-β-hexosaminidase (Hex; EC 3.2.1.52) is a member of the glycosyl hydrolase family 20 (GH20) that catalyses the removal of terminal, non-reducing <italic toggle=""yes"">N</italic>-acetyl-β-<sc>d</sc>-glucosamine (GlcNAc) or galactosamine (GalNAc) residues from gangliosides, glycoproteins or glycosaminoglycans<xref rid=""CIT0001"" ref-type=""bibr""><sup>1</sup></xref>. In humans two Hex isoforms are readily detectable, namely HexA and HexB.

Since many of the TSD-causative mutations do not compromise the catalytic site, but target the α chain of HexA to endoplasmic reticulum-associate degradation (ERAD), the development of pharmacological chaperones (PCs) that can stabilise the native folding of the protein despite its anomalous conformation and restore activity appears attractive<xref rid=""CIT0015"" ref-type=""bibr""><sup>15</sup></xref>.

We and others have previously shown that replacing the amine-type endocyclic nitrogen atom in iminosugar frameworks by a pseudoamide-type nitrogen (sp<sup>2</sup>-iminosugars) represents a versatile strategy to achieve highly selective glycosidase ligands for fundamental studies on enzyme mechanisms<xref rid=""CIT0040"" ref-type=""bibr""><sup>40–43</sup></xref> and drug discovery, with applications ranging from cancer<xref rid=""CIT0044"" ref-type=""bibr""><sup>44–46</sup></xref> and inflammation<xref rid=""CIT0047"" ref-type=""bibr""><sup>47</sup></xref> to antiparasitic agents<xref rid=""CIT0048"" ref-type=""bibr""><sup>48</sup></xref>. sp<sup>2</sup>-iminosugars are very well adapted to molecular diversity schemes, including modifications in the configurational pattern, the heterocycle framework and the nature of substituents<xref rid=""CIT0049"" ref-type=""bibr""><sup>49–53</sup></xref>.

To probe this hypothesis, we have now synthesised a series of monocyclic and bicyclic GalNAc mimetics belonging to the sp<sup>2</sup>-iminosugar family bearing varying substituents, determined the inhibitory profile against different glycosidases and evaluated the hexosaminidase-enhancing capabilities in fibroblasts from healthy donors and TSD patients. The results provide a proof of concept of the potential of sp<sup>2</sup>-iminosugar-based PCs for the treatment of the late-onset form of TSD disease.  Grounding on the current structural knowledge on hexosaminidase-substrate (or inihibitor) complexes, we hypothesised that sp<sup>2</sup>-iminosugars emulating the substitution profile and stereochemistry of GalNAc would fit in the active site of HexA but not in that of the related enzyme OGA. By equipping the glycomimetic core with suitable appendages, providing additional contacts with the enzyme, the ability to properly folding and rescuing mutant HexA causative of late-onset TSD could be optimised. To put this concept into practice, we conducted the direct conjugation of four different isothiocyanates with DGJNAc. The corresponding thiourea adducts were thus obtained and subsequently subjected to intramolecular cyclisation to afford bicyclic pyridine-thiazolidine derivatives. Nanomolar competitive inhibitors of HexA at pH 7, with high HexA/OGA selectivity, were identified in both the (neutral) thiourea and (basic) iminothiazolidine series. The inhibitory potency fell down by ten-fold at pH 5, which should facilitate the dissociation of the HexA-glycomimetic complex at the lysosome, where the Hex substrate (namely G<sub>M2</sub> ganglioside) accumulates. In agreement with this notion, remarkable HexA activity enhancements were achieved in fibroblasts from TSD patients having the G269S mutation, associated to the late-onset phenotype. Interestingly, most candidates still enhanced G269S HexA activity in cell assays even at high (200 µM) concentration. Altogether, the results validate the approach of using GalNAc sp<sup>2</sup>-iminosugar mimics to identify drug-like pharmacological chaperone candidates for the treatment of late-onset TSD.

Patient TSD-001 was treated at 30 months with an equimolar mix of AAVrh8-HEXA and AAVrh8-HEXB administered intrathecally (i.t.), with 75% of the total dose (1 × 10<sup>14</sup> vector genomes (vg)) in the cisterna magna and 25% at the thoracolumbar junction. Patient TSD-002 was treated at 7 months by combined bilateral thalamic (1.5 × 10<sup>12</sup> vg per thalamus) and i.t. infusion (3.9 × 10<sup>13</sup> vg). Both patients were immunosuppressed. Injection procedures were well tolerated, with no vector-related adverse events (AEs) to date. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) HexA activity increased from baseline and remained stable in both patients. TSD-002 showed disease stabilization by 3 months after injection with ongoing myelination, a temporary deviation from the natural history of infantile TSD, but disease progression was evident at 6 months after treatment. TSD-001 remains seizure-free at 5 years of age on the same anticonvulsant therapy as before therapy. TSD-002 developed anticonvulsant-responsive seizures at 2 years of age.

         We looked for evidence to show whether identifying people who are carriers for thalassaemia, sickle cell disease, cystic fibrosis, or Tay‐Sachs disease, before pregnancy leads to improving reproductive choice and pregnancy outcomes. 
          <bold>Background</bold>
         Across the world, about 6% of children are born with a birth defect of genetic or partially genetic origin.  Many of these conditions can be passed down from parent to child. There are tests to identify the genetic risk of the most common genetic conditions (thalassaemia, sickle cell disease, cystic fibrosis, or Tay‐Sachs disease) before pregnancy. In these conditions, called autosomal recessive conditions, the parents of affected children are 'carriers' of the condition, which means they do not usually have symptoms. All 'carrier' couples will have a 25% chance of having an affected child. Risk assessment for these genetic conditions before getting pregnant would benefit potential parents who may be carriers. This information would give the at‐risk couple the opportunity to make fully informed decisions about family planning. However, genetic risk assessment before pregnancy may potentially have a negative psychological impact. This is an updated version of the original review.

         Although no trials were identified in which people taking part would have equal chances of being in either group, there are several studies which are not so strictly designed which support current policy recommendations for genetic risk assessment prior to pregnancy in routine clinical practice. We recommend considering potential observational studies in future reviews as well as looking at ‘expanded carrier screening’ before pregnancy and not just screening for one condition. Any future trials need to consider legal, ethical and cultural barriers to implementing genetic risk assessment before pregnancy.",Full text not available in PMC,N/A,11 10 2021
"Serum Cytokine Profile, Beta-Hexosaminidase A Enzymatic Activity and GM<sub>2</sub> Ganglioside Levels in the Plasma of a Tay-Sachs Disease Patient after Cord Blood Cell Transplantation and Curcumin Administration: A Case Report","Tay-Sachs disease (TSD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder that occurs due to a deficiency of a β hexosaminidase A (HexA) enzyme, resulting in the accumulation of GM<sub>2</sub> gangliosides. In this work, we analyzed the effect of umbilical cord blood cell transplantation (UCBCT) and curcumin administration on the course of the disease in a patient with adult TSD. The patient’s serum cytokine profile was determined using multiplex analysis. The level of GM<sub>2</sub> gangliosides in plasma was determined using mass spectrometry. The enzymatic activity of HexA in the plasma of the patient was assessed using a fluorescent substrate assay. The HexA α-subunit (HexA) concentration was determined using ELISA. It was shown that both UCBCT and curcumin administration led to a change in the patient’s cytokine profile. The UCBCT resulted in an increase in the concentration of HexA in the patient’s serum and in an improvement in the patient’s neurological status. However, neither UCBCT nor curcumin were able to alter HexA activity and the level of GM<sub>2</sub> in patient’s plasma. The data obtained indicate that UCBCT and curcumin administration can alter the immunity of a patient with TSD, reduce the level of inflammatory cytokines and thereby improve the patient’s condition.","Tay-Sachs disease (TSD) is a lysosomal storage disease (LSD) which is caused by various mutations in the HexA gene encoding an α-subunit of a β hexosaminidase A (HexA) enzyme. This enzyme specifically cleaves GM<sub>2</sub> gangliosides (hereinafter GM<sub>2</sub>), which are part of the cell membrane. The HexA enzyme deficiency leads to the accumulation of GM<sub>2</sub> in various cells and tissues of the body. Nerve tissue is mainly affected due to the high distribution of GM<sub>2</sub> in neurons. The accumulation of GM<sub>2</sub> in the cells of the nervous system leads to disability and subsequent death. TSD is characterized by severe neurodegeneration, the onset of an inflammatory response and mental and physical retardation. There are infantile, juvenile and adult forms of TSD, which differ in residual HexA activity, age of onset and severity of the disease [<xref rid=""B1-life-11-01007"" ref-type=""bibr"">1</xref>,<xref rid=""B2-life-11-01007"" ref-type=""bibr"">2</xref>,<xref rid=""B3-life-11-01007"" ref-type=""bibr"">3</xref>,<xref rid=""B4-life-11-01007"" ref-type=""bibr"">4</xref>]. Currently, there are no effective treatments for TSD, and symptomatic therapy is mostly used to support the patients. However, approaches are being developed that can increase the expression of the missing enzyme in order to ease the course of the disease. One of these approaches is the use of curcumin, which has a wide range of therapeutic properties; in particular, it has potential to prevent the development of various neurodegenerative diseases and/or slow their progression [<xref rid=""B5-life-11-01007"" ref-type=""bibr"">5</xref>,<xref rid=""B6-life-11-01007"" ref-type=""bibr"">6</xref>]. To date, there are several studies aimed at studying the molecular mechanisms through which curcumin can affect the level of gene expression of the α- and β-subunits of the HexA enzyme. For example, the effect of the monocarbonyl analogue of curcumin on the activation of TFEB, which is the main regulator of many cellular processes, such as lysosomal functions, autophagy and membrane repair, has been investigated. It has been shown that curcumin can induce autophagy by directly binding to TFEB and promoting its nuclear translocation. Curcumin-dependent activation of TFEB led to an increase in the expression of the HexA and HexB genes, as well as to an increase in the activity of hexosaminidases and their attraction to the plasma membrane. Based on these data, the monocarbonyl analogue of curcumin may be regarded as a potential drug to treat GM<sub>2</sub> gangliosidosis, as it leads to an increase in the expression of genes encoding the HexA enzyme and also has the ability to stimulate autophagy, which is generally useful during neurodegeneration [<xref rid=""B7-life-11-01007"" ref-type=""bibr"">7</xref>,<xref rid=""B8-life-11-01007"" ref-type=""bibr"">8</xref>]. Curcumin has been shown to have an inhibitory effect on nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD), which is a process responsible for cleaving mRNAs containing stop codons and/or mRNAs that are not properly spliced. NMD does not allow defective proteins to be synthesized, while curcumin inhibits NMD and influences splicing factors, which in turn leads to an increase in the number of such defective transcripts and contributes to their stabilization. In particular a 1.5-fold increase in the expression of the mutant HexA gene was observed in skin fibroblasts isolated from a TSD patient after cultivation with curcumin (25 μM) for 24 h. It can be suggested that curcumin administration can increase the residual HexA activity in patients by promoting translation of the mutant transcripts [<xref rid=""B9-life-11-01007"" ref-type=""bibr"">9</xref>]. Cell culture studies have shown that due to the ability of curcumin to influence certain molecular pathways, it can increase the expression of the HexA and HexB genes, as well as HexA activity. Additionally, there are numerous studies showing the beneficial effects of curcumin in various neurodegenerative diseases [<xref rid=""B10-life-11-01007"" ref-type=""bibr"">10</xref>,<xref rid=""B11-life-11-01007"" ref-type=""bibr"">11</xref>,<xref rid=""B12-life-11-01007"" ref-type=""bibr"">12</xref>,<xref rid=""B13-life-11-01007"" ref-type=""bibr"">13</xref>,<xref rid=""B14-life-11-01007"" ref-type=""bibr"">14</xref>]. <xref rid=""app1-life-11-01007"" ref-type=""app"">Supplementary Table S2</xref> provides information on the pharmacokinetics and effectiveness of curcumin in various conditions. However, no investigations have been previously conducted on the effect of curcumin in TSD patients. Thus, it would be interesting to test the hypothesis that curcumin may be useful in the treatment of TSD. Transplantation of cells expressing a functional enzyme has been shown to prevent further disease progression and help prolong the life of patients [<xref rid=""B15-life-11-01007"" ref-type=""bibr"">15</xref>]. To increase the level of functionally active enzymes in LSD patients, umbilical cord blood cell transplantation (UCBCT) is used. The therapeutic effect is achieved as the umbilical cord blood is a source of stem cells, which constantly express normal enzymes [<xref rid=""B16-life-11-01007"" ref-type=""bibr"">16</xref>,<xref rid=""B17-life-11-01007"" ref-type=""bibr"">17</xref>,<xref rid=""B18-life-11-01007"" ref-type=""bibr"">18</xref>]. In the case of LSDs affecting the nervous system, UCBCT is also relevant, since it is known that blood-isolated immune cells are able to overcome the blood–brain barrier and deliver a normal enzyme to the nervous system [<xref rid=""B19-life-11-01007"" ref-type=""bibr"">19</xref>,<xref rid=""B20-life-11-01007"" ref-type=""bibr"">20</xref>]. For example, in children with Krabbe disease (demyelinating LSD) who received UCBCT before symptoms appeared, normal blood galactocerebrosidase levels, central nervous system myelination and continued developmental skill progress were observed. However, it is important to note that children undergoing transplantation after the appearance of the symptoms had minimal neurological improvements [<xref rid=""B21-life-11-01007"" ref-type=""bibr"">21</xref>,<xref rid=""B22-life-11-01007"" ref-type=""bibr"">22</xref>,<xref rid=""B23-life-11-01007"" ref-type=""bibr"">23</xref>,<xref rid=""B24-life-11-01007"" ref-type=""bibr"">24</xref>,<xref rid=""B25-life-11-01007"" ref-type=""bibr"">25</xref>]. Similar results were obtained after UCBCT in patients with metachromatic leukodystrophy (also demyelinating LSD) [<xref rid=""B26-life-11-01007"" ref-type=""bibr"">26</xref>,<xref rid=""B27-life-11-01007"" ref-type=""bibr"">27</xref>]. UCBCT has also been successfully used for other LSDs [<xref rid=""B28-life-11-01007"" ref-type=""bibr"">28</xref>,<xref rid=""B29-life-11-01007"" ref-type=""bibr"">29</xref>,<xref rid=""B30-life-11-01007"" ref-type=""bibr"">30</xref>,<xref rid=""B31-life-11-01007"" ref-type=""bibr"">31</xref>]. The UCBCT therapeutic effect is probably achieved by cross-correcting the affected neurons. Cord blood cells cross the blood–brain barrier and secrete a functional enzyme that is taken up by nerve cells through endocytosis and enters the lysosomes using mannose-6-phosphate receptors. Thus, cross-correction leads to an increase in the level of the Hex enzyme, clarification of nerve cells from GM<sub>2</sub> gangliosides and apoptosis arrest [<xref rid=""B32-life-11-01007"" ref-type=""bibr"">32</xref>]. Based on the above findings, we hypothesized that UCBCT and curcumin intake may have a therapeutic effect and improve the condition of the TSD patient. In our study, for the first time, the effect of curcumin and UCBCT on the serum cytokine profile, GM<sub>2</sub> level and HexA enzymatic activity in the plasma of a patient with adult TSD was investigated.    In the present work, the influence of UCBCT and curcumin administration on the cytokine profile, HexA activity and GM<sub>2</sub> level in a patient with an adult form of TSD was investigated. The patient’s serum levels of VEGF, EGF, eotaxin-1, MDC, sCD40L and IL-8 were significantly higher compared to the control group. A decrease in the levels of IL-8 and EGF after UCBCT and decreases in EGF, PDGF-AA, PDGF-AA/AB, eotaxin-1, sCD40L and IP-10 in the serum after curcumin administration were revealed. The data show that the UCBCT and curcumin administration affect the patient’s cytokine profile. Additionally, UCBCT leads to an increase in the concentration of HexA in the serum and an improvement in the patient’s neurological status. We suggest that as a result of UCBCT, the functional enzyme produced by donor cells can reduce the number of accumulated GM<sub>2</sub>, which can reduce tissue damage. In addition, the immunoregulatory properties of cord blood cells may ensure the reduction of inflammation. Curcumin has an anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effect, which may lead to a decrease in the level of inflammatory cytokines. However, neither UCBCT nor the curcumin administration affected the activity of HexA and the level of GM<sub>2</sub> in the patient’s plasma. Thus, in this case report, we have investigated UCBCT and curcumin supplementation as potentially useful approaches for the relief of a TSD patient’s condition.

Natural History of Tay-Sachs Disease in Sheep,"Tay-Sachs disease (TSD) is a fatal neurodegenerative disease caused by a deficiency of the enzyme β-N-acetylhexosaminidase A (HexA). TSD naturally occurs in Jacob sheep is the only experimental model of TSD. TSD in sheep recapitulates neurologic features similar to juvenile onset and late onset TSD patients. Due to the paucity of human literature on pathology of TSD, a better natural history in the sheep TSD brain, which is on the same order of magnitude as a child’s, is necessary for evaluating therapy and characterizing the pathological events that occur. To provide clinicians and researchers with a clearer understanding of longitudinal pathology in patients, we compare spectrum of clinical signs and brain pathology in mildly symptomatic (3-months), moderately symptomatic (6-months), or severely affected TSD sheep (humane endpoint at ~9-months of age). Increased GM2 ganglioside in the CSF of TSD sheep and a TSD specific biomarker on MRS (taurine) correlate with disease severity. Microglial activation and reactive astrocytes were observed globally on histopathology in TSD sheep with a widespread reduction in oligodendrocyte density. Myelination is reduced primarily in the forebrain illustrated by loss of white matter on MRI. GM2 and GM3 ganglioside were increased and distributed differently in various tissues. The study of TSD in the sheep model provides a natural history to shed light on the pathophysiology of TSD, which is of utmost importance due to novel therapeutics being assessed in human patients.",Full text not available in PMC,N/A,2 12 2021

"Investigating Immune Responses to the scAAV9-<italic toggle=""yes"">HEXM</italic> Gene Therapy Treatment in Tay–Sachs Disease and Sandhoff Disease Mouse Models","GM2 gangliosidosis disorders are a group of neurodegenerative diseases that result from a functional deficiency of the enzyme β-hexosaminidase A (HexA). HexA consists of an α- and β-subunit; a deficiency in either subunit results in Tay–Sachs Disease (TSD) or Sandhoff Disease (SD), respectively. Viral vector gene transfer is viewed as a potential method of treating these diseases. A recently constructed isoenzyme to HexA, called HexM, has the ability to effectively catabolize GM2 gangliosides in vivo. Previous gene transfer studies have revealed that the scAAV9-<italic toggle=""yes"">HEXM</italic> treatment can improve survival in the murine SD model. However, it is speculated that this treatment could elicit an immune response to the carrier capsid and “non-self”-expressed transgene. This study was designed to assess the immunocompetence of TSD and SD mice, and test the immune response to the scAAV9-<italic toggle=""yes"">HEXM</italic> gene transfer. HexM vector-treated mice developed a significant anti-HexM T cell response and antibody response. This study confirms that TSD and SD mouse models are immunocompetent, and that gene transfer expression can create an immune response in these mice. These mouse models could be utilized for investigating methods of mitigating immune responses to gene transfer-expressed “non-self” proteins, and potentially improve treatment efficacy.","GM2 gangliosidoses are a group of inherited lysosomal storage diseases, characterized by the toxic accumulation of GM2 gangliosides in the brain. This is the result of a deficiency of the β-hexosaminidase A (HexA) enzyme involved in the catabolism of these lipids [<xref rid=""B1-ijms-22-06751"" ref-type=""bibr"">1</xref>]. HexA is a heterodimer consisting of an α- and β-subunit [<xref rid=""B2-ijms-22-06751"" ref-type=""bibr"">2</xref>]. Mutations in either of these genes can produce a HexA deficiency. Tay–Sachs Disease (TSD) results from a deficient α-subunit [<xref rid=""B3-ijms-22-06751"" ref-type=""bibr"">3</xref>]; a deficient β-subunit leads to Sandhoff Disease (SD) [<xref rid=""B1-ijms-22-06751"" ref-type=""bibr"">1</xref>]. Both TSD and SD have very similar clinical phenotypes. Between three to five months of age, patients with the infantile-onset form of these diseases typically show signs of impaired motor function, decreased attentiveness, visual impairment, and rapid mental deterioration [<xref rid=""B4-ijms-22-06751"" ref-type=""bibr"">4</xref>]. Patients with the infantile-onset form commonly die before four years of age. Juvenile-onset and adult forms of the disease are less severe, with a slower deterioration [<xref rid=""B5-ijms-22-06751"" ref-type=""bibr"">5</xref>]. There is currently no successful treatment for GM2 gangliosidoses. The murine TSD model was generated by knockout of the mouse <italic toggle=""yes"">Hexa</italic> gene, encoding for the α-subunit of HexA, thereby resulting in deficient HexA activity. TSD mice show GM2 build-up in certain regions of the brain; however, they do not demonstrate a significant neurological decline. This could be due an alternative metabolic pathway in mice, the sialidase pathway, which can catabolize GM2 gangliosides to GA2 [<xref rid=""B6-ijms-22-06751"" ref-type=""bibr"">6</xref>]. These lipids can then be broken down to glucosylceramide by HexB (ββ homodimer). As TSD mice still retain their HexB activity, they can maintain the GM2 lipid accumulation below toxic levels, without the need for HexA. The SD mouse model was created by knock-out of the <italic toggle=""yes"">Hexb</italic> gene, encoding for the β-subunit. SD mice have a deficiency in both HexA and HexB enzyme activity. In contrast to the TSD mouse model, SD mice display extensive GM2 accumulation in the brain, showing symptoms similar to the infantile-onset form of the disease, with impaired behavioral function, muscle weakness, tremors, and ataxia [<xref rid=""B7-ijms-22-06751"" ref-type=""bibr"">7</xref>]. Multiple studies have been performed using each of these mouse models to further comprehend the mechanisms of the diseases, and to find strategies to treat them. The immunocompetence of TSD and SD mice has been questioned in previous literature. The accumulation of lipids in glycosphingolipid (GSL) lysosomal storage disorders, including GM2 gangliosidoses, has been shown to impair the selection and function of invariant natural killer T cells (<italic toggle=""yes"">i</italic>NKT cells), a subset of T lymphocytes that help mediate regulatory immune function [<xref rid=""B8-ijms-22-06751"" ref-type=""bibr"">8</xref>]. Immunological alterations in the thymus of SD mice have also been observed in the severe progressive stage of the neurological disease, past 15 weeks of age [<xref rid=""B9-ijms-22-06751"" ref-type=""bibr"">9</xref>]. The development of autoimmune responses is evident in these mice, with a decrease in immature CD4<sup>+</sup>/CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells and an increase in CD4<sup>+</sup>/CD8<sup>−</sup> T cells in the thymus, as well as the upregulation of genes associated with immune responses. Since it was not clearly proven before that TSD and SD mice can mount an immune response to a foreign protein, it was decided that the immunocompetence of these mouse models must be assessed. This was evaluated in this study by investigating the B and T cell immune responses of both TSD and SD mice to the expression of a human transgene, <italic toggle=""yes"">HEXM</italic>. There is a history of utilizing adeno-associated viral vectors (AAV) to treat TSD and SD in preclinical models [<xref rid=""B10-ijms-22-06751"" ref-type=""bibr"">10</xref>,<xref rid=""B11-ijms-22-06751"" ref-type=""bibr"">11</xref>,<xref rid=""B12-ijms-22-06751"" ref-type=""bibr"">12</xref>,<xref rid=""B13-ijms-22-06751"" ref-type=""bibr"">13</xref>]. Important for central nervous system (CNS) gene therapy applications, AAV can transduce non-dividing cells and can confer long-term stable gene expression without associated inflammation or toxicity [<xref rid=""B14-ijms-22-06751"" ref-type=""bibr"">14</xref>,<xref rid=""B15-ijms-22-06751"" ref-type=""bibr"">15</xref>,<xref rid=""B16-ijms-22-06751"" ref-type=""bibr"">16</xref>,<xref rid=""B17-ijms-22-06751"" ref-type=""bibr"">17</xref>]. Several groups have shown that AAV serotype 9 (AAV9) vectors can achieve broad distribution across the CNS, and provide dramatic therapeutic benefit to neurological disorders using intravenous (IV) and cerebrospinal (CSF) routes of delivery [<xref rid=""B18-ijms-22-06751"" ref-type=""bibr"">18</xref>,<xref rid=""B19-ijms-22-06751"" ref-type=""bibr"">19</xref>,<xref rid=""B20-ijms-22-06751"" ref-type=""bibr"">20</xref>,<xref rid=""B21-ijms-22-06751"" ref-type=""bibr"">21</xref>,<xref rid=""B22-ijms-22-06751"" ref-type=""bibr"">22</xref>,<xref rid=""B23-ijms-22-06751"" ref-type=""bibr"">23</xref>,<xref rid=""B24-ijms-22-06751"" ref-type=""bibr"">24</xref>]. Therapeutic approaches utilizing AAV9 with IV or CSF administration may scale and translate more effectively from mice to larger animal models, than direct parenchymal vector delivery [<xref rid=""B18-ijms-22-06751"" ref-type=""bibr"">18</xref>,<xref rid=""B22-ijms-22-06751"" ref-type=""bibr"">22</xref>,<xref rid=""B25-ijms-22-06751"" ref-type=""bibr"">25</xref>,<xref rid=""B26-ijms-22-06751"" ref-type=""bibr"">26</xref>,<xref rid=""B27-ijms-22-06751"" ref-type=""bibr"">27</xref>,<xref rid=""B28-ijms-22-06751"" ref-type=""bibr"">28</xref>]. Many clinical trials using AAV9 in the treatment of varying CNS disorders have been initiated (Giant Axonal Neuropathy, intrathecal [IT] administration, <uri>clinicaltrials.gov</uri> NCT02362438); MPS IIIA (IV administration, <uri>clinicaltrials.gov</uri> NCT02716246); Neuronal Ceroid Lipofuscinosis Type 6 (IT administration, <uri>clinicaltrials.gov</uri> NCT02725580)), such that AAV9 now has a track record of human application. The AAV9-mediated therapy for the treatment of Spinal Muscular Atrophy (<uri>clinicaltrials.gov</uri> NCT02122952) has been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (Zolgensma<sup>®</sup> FDA [<xref rid=""B29-ijms-22-06751"" ref-type=""bibr"">29</xref>]). The immune response to the AAV9 capsid in TSD mice was also assessed in this study. A recently constructed isoenzyme to the human HexA heterodimer, called HexM, has the ability to efficiently catabolize GM2 gangliosides in vivo [<xref rid=""B30-ijms-22-06751"" ref-type=""bibr"">30</xref>]. The HexM enzyme consists of two μ-subunits. This μ-subunit was engineered using the 529 amino acid sequence of the human β-hexosaminidase α-subunit as a base, with 21 amino-acid substitutions and one deletion made to incorporate the stable dimer interface and GM2AP binding interface of the human β-hexosaminidase β-subunit [<xref rid=""B30-ijms-22-06751"" ref-type=""bibr"">30</xref>]. The HexM coding gene, <italic toggle=""yes"">HEXM</italic>, has a size of 1.6 kb, and thus can be packaged in a self-complementary AAV viral genome configuration, with short promoter and polyA regulatory sequences. Self-complementary AAV vectors can afford >10-fold higher gene transfer efficiency, versus traditional single-stranded AAV vectors [<xref rid=""B25-ijms-22-06751"" ref-type=""bibr"">25</xref>,<xref rid=""B31-ijms-22-06751"" ref-type=""bibr"">31</xref>,<xref rid=""B32-ijms-22-06751"" ref-type=""bibr"">32</xref>]. Previous pre-clinical gene transfer studies have shown that the scAAV9-<italic toggle=""yes"">HEXM</italic> treatment reduces GM2 ganglioside levels in the brain, and improves survival in mouse models [<xref rid=""B12-ijms-22-06751"" ref-type=""bibr"">12</xref>,<xref rid=""B23-ijms-22-06751"" ref-type=""bibr"">23</xref>]. Although the field of gene therapy has progressed immensely over the years, one of the challenges faced is the potential for patients to develop an immunological response to the treatment [<xref rid=""B33-ijms-22-06751"" ref-type=""bibr"">33</xref>,<xref rid=""B34-ijms-22-06751"" ref-type=""bibr"">34</xref>]. Gene therapy treatments have been found to trigger undesirable T and B cell immune responses in previous studies [<xref rid=""B35-ijms-22-06751"" ref-type=""bibr"">35</xref>,<xref rid=""B36-ijms-22-06751"" ref-type=""bibr"">36</xref>,<xref rid=""B37-ijms-22-06751"" ref-type=""bibr"">37</xref>,<xref rid=""B38-ijms-22-06751"" ref-type=""bibr"">38</xref>,<xref rid=""B39-ijms-22-06751"" ref-type=""bibr"">39</xref>], especially when the therapeutic protein or viral vector is seen as foreign by the host immune system. These immune responses could contribute to a failure of the gene therapy treatment to provide long-term benefits. Therefore, when studying treatment options for genetic disorders using gene therapy, it is crucial to have an animal model that could allow one to investigate the impact of an immune response to the transgene or viral capsid. As the HexM protein is a hybrid variant of the human β-hexosaminidase α- and β-subunits, it has the potential to create novel “non-self” immune responses. In the present study, we confirmed the immunocompetency of TSD and SD mice, and tested the immune response towards intravenous delivery of scAAV9-<italic toggle=""yes"">HEXM.</italic> Sera were analyzed for antibodies to the vector or transgene product, and lymph node cells and splenocytes were analyzed for the production of the cytokine interferon-γ (IFN-γ). Analysis of the vector biodistribution of the <italic toggle=""yes"">HEXM</italic> gene was performed to assess the stability of transduced cells in the brain and non-CNS tissues. It was found that the scAAV9-<italic toggle=""yes"">HEXM</italic> treatment induced a T and B cell immune response to the viral capsid and the expressed human protein in TSD and SD mice. To evaluate the immunocompetency of SD and TSD mouse models, and the immune response to gene therapy treatment, adult heterozygous and homozygous knockout mice were injected intravenously with either scAAV9-<italic toggle=""yes"">HEXM</italic>, HexM purified protein (+/−adjuvant), or vehicle (+/−adjuvant). Experimental mice were given either one injection or two, 3 weeks apart. The second injection may have varied from the first injection, depending on the treatment group. TSD mice were euthanized 3 or 6 weeks post injection 1. SD mice were euthanized either 3 weeks or 9 weeks post injection 1. For a detailed description of the study design, refer to the Study Design section (<xref ref-type=""sec"" rid=""sec4dot3-ijms-22-06751"">Section 4.3</xref>) of the Materials and Methods (<xref ref-type=""sec"" rid=""sec4-ijms-22-06751"">Section 4</xref>). This study demonstrated that the scAAV9-<italic toggle=""yes"">HEXM</italic> gene therapy treatment initiated a T and B cell immune response to the expressed human-derived HexM enzyme, in both TSD and SD mouse models. The delivery of scAAV9-<italic toggle=""yes"">HEXM</italic> induced T cells that responded to the HexM PEPscreen<sup>®</sup> library, and produced high levels of anti-HexM antibodies in the sera of the TSD mice, and elevated levels in the sera of SD mice. A high antibody response to purified HexM protein was observed in Het and KO SD mice in this study, when given in combination with adjuvant (<xref ref-type=""fig"" rid=""ijms-22-06751-f005"">Figure 5</xref>). Protein-specific immune responses to therapeutic transgenes have also been observed in other species; the induction of an immune response to a non-self-protein has been shown in rat models [<xref rid=""B40-ijms-22-06751"" ref-type=""bibr"">40</xref>], and in non-human primates [<xref rid=""B41-ijms-22-06751"" ref-type=""bibr"">41</xref>,<xref rid=""B42-ijms-22-06751"" ref-type=""bibr"">42</xref>] following AAV9-mediated expression. This undesirable immune response may have a negative impact on the efficiency of the gene therapy treatment, especially in patients with null expression of the expressed protein. The presence of T and B cell responses to HexM, in TSD and SD mice, confirms the immunocompetence of these mouse models. We did not investigate thymic alterations or natural killer (NK)-cell activity, however, as previously described for these mice [<xref rid=""B9-ijms-22-06751"" ref-type=""bibr"">9</xref>]. In this study, some cohorts of mice had a follow-up injection of HexM-His<sub>6</sub> protein with adjuvant, and a later termination time point, in order to investigate a stimulated response. It was hypothesized that as a result of this challenge, the response in these cohorts would be stronger. This was indeed the case for the antibody response in TSD mice, following challenge with the HexM protein. However, it was not the case for the HexM-specific T cell response. This might be explained by a ‘linked recognition’ mechanism of immune stimulation, in which the activation of T cell-dependent antibodies is initiated by helper T cells [<xref rid=""B43-ijms-22-06751"" ref-type=""bibr"">43</xref>]. In this case, a higher T cell response would be expected earlier in the infection stage. This is because previously naïve B cells would be activated by accessory signals from armed helper T cells that recognize the antigen, thus leading to the activation and release of antibodies. To further study the specificity of the T cell response in the TSD mice, the ELISpot assay was repeated using cryo-preserved splenocytes. Repeating the assay provided an opportunity to explore the nature of the immune response, by separating the total HexM pool into the three separate pools. In addition to the T-cell response against novel HexM epitopes (i.e., not homologous with either mouse or human HexA), it was also noted that a smaller, but statistically significant, T-cell response to the HexM peptide pool with 100% homology between human and mouse (<xref ref-type=""fig"" rid=""ijms-22-06751-f001"">Figure 1</xref>C), was present as well. Surprisingly, this was the case even in Het mice that express endogenous mouse HexA. Our study did not formally delineate the relative contributions of the HexM- and HEXA-specific epitopes to the overall immune response. Moreover, it is not clear why the HexA epitopes that are conserved between mice and humans still stimulated T cells in Het mice. However, it is postulated that the immune response to neighboring HexM epitopes, or the AAV9 vector, may act as an adjuvant for immune stimulation. Vehicle-injected mice did not show a T-cell response against these mouse-human conserved HexA epitopes. Therefore, we can speculate that the immune response against the overall HexM protein stimulated this “autoimmune” response against these conserved HexA epitopes. Although the AAV vector has a relatively low pro-inflammatory profile [<xref rid=""B44-ijms-22-06751"" ref-type=""bibr"">44</xref>], previous studies have shown a negative effect of pre-existing immunity to AAV on the efficiency of the gene therapy treatment [<xref rid=""B39-ijms-22-06751"" ref-type=""bibr"">39</xref>,<xref rid=""B45-ijms-22-06751"" ref-type=""bibr"">45</xref>,<xref rid=""B46-ijms-22-06751"" ref-type=""bibr"">46</xref>]. Even low levels of neutralizing antibodies to AAV can counteract large doses of the vector [<xref rid=""B25-ijms-22-06751"" ref-type=""bibr"">25</xref>,<xref rid=""B37-ijms-22-06751"" ref-type=""bibr"">37</xref>]. In this study, the data obtained from AAV9 capsid ELISpots and neutralizing antibody assays revealed that the mice did mount an immune response to the AAV9 capsid. There was a high T cell response to the AAV9 capsid observed in TSD mice after gene therapy treatment compared to vehicle injected mice. Unfortunately, this assay was not repeated using splenocytes isolated from SD mice, due to a shortage of cells. There was also the presence of high levels of neutralizing antibodies to the AAV9 capsid in the sera of TSD and SD mice given scAAV9-<italic toggle=""yes"">HEXM</italic>, compared to the vehicle (<xref ref-type=""app"" rid=""app1-ijms-22-06751"">Supplementary Tables S2 and S3</xref>). The intravenous administration of the AAV vector does have a high likelihood of provoking an immune response, therefore these results were expected. The biodistribution of HexM DNA revealed that the gene therapy reached the liver and brain in both mouse models, and that the immune response to the treatment was accompanied by a significant decrease in genome persistence in the liver of treated TSD mice. This could be the result of the immune cells attacking the human derived transgene product as well as the viral capsid. Consequently, the transduced cell population would diminish, thereby decreasing the efficiency of the treatment. A low biodistribution due to an immune response to gene therapy was also evident in a study assessing the immune response following AAV9-GFP injections in non-human primates (NHPs) [<xref rid=""B42-ijms-22-06751"" ref-type=""bibr"">42</xref>]. It was observed that GFP-treated NHPs demonstrated a decrease in GFP expression in the lumbar spinal cord over time. GFP expression was sustained only when animals were treated with an immunosuppressant, to diminish the anti-GFP immune response. Although the correlation between antibody levels in the sera and vector genomes in the liver and in the brain were not statistically significant, the observations obtained from our study are a clear indication that the immune response to HexM and the AAV9 capsid could contribute to either the failure or decreased long-term benefit of the scAAV9-<italic toggle=""yes"">HEXM</italic> gene therapy treatment. In our study, it should be noted that the decrease in the liver distribution could also be due to other toxicity mechanisms related to the high level of liver transduction. We acknowledge several limitations of our study. The study design was slightly different in TSD and SD mice. However, even though the TSD and SD studies were done independently in separate labs, both showed similar results. We also acknowledge that we did not assess the long-term immune response to HexM, to observe if there was any tolerization that could have been generated, even after the initial immune response. However, the objective of this study was to assess the immunocompetence of TSD and SD mouse models in the investigation of immune responses to the <italic toggle=""yes"">HEXM</italic> gene transfer. In future experiments, detailed T-cell subset analysis to examine specific immune cells is warranted. Another small limitation is that we studied only the intravenous route of vector administration and no other route of delivery. The rationale was to create a normal immune response of the body. Delivery of the vector directly into slightly immune-privileged compartments like brain parenchyma or into cerebrospinal fluid (via either lumbar puncture or intracerebroventricular or cisterna magna injection) can have advantages as an alternative to the IV route and shall be studied in future optimization studies but were not considered best for this immunocompetency study. The presence of an immune response to the therapeutic protein HexM and to the AAV9 viral capsid could have detrimental effects on scAAV9-<italic toggle=""yes"">HEXM</italic> gene delivery as a treatment for GM2 gangliosidoses. Further, it should be noted that this type of immune response could pertain not only to HexM, but also other attempts to deliver HexA or HexB into patients who lack the respective native enzyme, such as in the infantile forms of the diseases. It is imperative to formulate strategies to either prevent this unwanted immune response, or to tolerize the patient to the therapeutic protein and viral capsid. A method for inducing immune tolerance in a patient would allow a lower dose of the treatment to be used while producing a persistent therapeutic result. Using a lower dose would also decrease the potential for toxicity and reduce the cost of the treatment. Therefore, the use of immunomodulatory gene therapy may be essential for the long-term treatment of GM2 gangliosidosis disorders. ",N/A,23 6 2021

","Tay–Sachs disease (TSD, OMIM#272800) is an autosomal recessive lysosomal storage disorder caused by mutations of <italic toggle=""yes"">HEXA</italic> gene on chromosome 15q23, which encodes the α‐subunit of the enzyme Hexosaminidase A (HEXA) (Lew et al., <xref rid=""mgg31677-bib-0009"" ref-type=""ref"">2015</xref>). HEXA is an enzyme that degrades GM2‐gangliosides in the lysosomes of neuronal cells. Accumulation of GM2‐gangliosides causes fatal neurological toxicity and function decline (Lew et al., <xref rid=""mgg31677-bib-0009"" ref-type=""ref"">2015</xref>). TSD, the acute infantile form, is one of three clinical subtypes of HEXA deficiency disorders. These three subtypes (i.e., TSD, juvenile HEXA deficiency, and late‐onset HEXA deficiency) differ in the levels of HEXA residual enzymatic activity. Patients with TSD usually have no or extremely low levels of HEXA activity, while those with juvenile or late‐onset forms have higher residual levels of HEXA activity (Kaback & Desnick, <xref rid=""mgg31677-bib-0008"" ref-type=""ref"">2011</xref>; Solovyeva et al., <xref rid=""mgg31677-bib-0013"" ref-type=""ref"">2018</xref>). TSD is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder characterized by loss of motor skills, progressive muscle weakness, increased startle responses, and seizures (Kaback & Desnick, <xref rid=""mgg31677-bib-0008"" ref-type=""ref"">2011</xref>). Typical physical examination findings include hypotonia, spasticity, hyperreflexia, and cherry‐red spots on the retina (Kaback & Desnick, <xref rid=""mgg31677-bib-0008"" ref-type=""ref"">2011</xref>). Regression of neurodevelopment begins in early infancy between 3 and 6 months of age, and most patients do not survive beyond 4 years of age (Solovyeva et al., <xref rid=""mgg31677-bib-0013"" ref-type=""ref"">2018</xref>). The worldwide prevalence of TSD is one in 100,000 births, with a carrier frequency of one in 250 births (Solovyeva et al., <xref rid=""mgg31677-bib-0013"" ref-type=""ref"">2018</xref>). In certain populations, such as the Ashkenazi Jews and French Canadians, the prevalence is higher, with an incidence of one in 3,900 births in unscreened Jewish populations (Lew et al., <xref rid=""mgg31677-bib-0009"" ref-type=""ref"">2015</xref>). However, the disease is relatively rare among Asians, which has an estimated prevalence of one in 360,000 births (Jin et al., <xref rid=""mgg31677-bib-0007"" ref-type=""ref"">2004</xref>). Specifically, there have been only two reported TSD cases in Korea to date (Choi et al., <xref rid=""mgg31677-bib-0003"" ref-type=""ref"">1999</xref>; Jin et al., <xref rid=""mgg31677-bib-0007"" ref-type=""ref"">2004</xref>). We present three independent Korean children with typical clinical manifestations and neurodevelopmental regression at around 8 months of age, who were biochemically and molecularly confirmed as an infantile form of TSD. The Institutional Review Board of Seoul National University Hospital approved this study (H‐1904‐054‐1027).

GM2‐gangliosidosis is a group of diseases caused by a deficiency of the hexosaminidase enzyme, which is responsible for degrading GM2‐gangliosides. Two isoenzymes of hexosaminidase are known: HEXA, which consists of one α‐subunit and one β‐subunit, and HEXB, which consists two β‐subunits (Ferreira & Gahl, <xref rid=""mgg31677-bib-0005"" ref-type=""ref"">2017</xref>). These α‐subunit and a β‐subunit are encoded by <italic toggle=""yes"">HEXA</italic> and <italic toggle=""yes"">HEXB</italic>, respectively (Dersh et al., <xref rid=""mgg31677-bib-0004"" ref-type=""ref"">2016</xref>; Mark et al., <xref rid=""mgg31677-bib-0010"" ref-type=""ref"">2003</xref>). Mutations in <italic toggle=""yes"">HEXB</italic> lead to Sandhoff disease (OMIM#268800), which is another type of GM2‐gangliosides. Compared to TSD patients, those who are diagnosed with Sandhoff disease have deficiencies of both HEXA and HEXB. They may be clinically indistinguishable from TSD patients because their onset and type of neurological symptoms are very similar. However, some non‐neurological characteristics, including hepatosplenomegaly and skeletal abnormalities, are more common in Sandhoff disease (Kaback & Desnick, <xref rid=""mgg31677-bib-0008"" ref-type=""ref"">2011</xref>). Characteristic cherry‐red spots in the macula are seen due to GM2‐ganglioside accumulation in the ganglion cells of the retina for all TSD patients. The swollen ganglion cells located on the edge of the macula of the retina become pale, thus emphasizing the cherry‐red color of the choroid (Ferreira & Gahl, <xref rid=""mgg31677-bib-0005"" ref-type=""ref"">2017</xref>). In our report, ophthalmologic examinations revealed cherry‐red spots in the retina in all three patients. However, this finding is not pathognomonic for GM2‐gangliosidosis, as it can be found in other lysosomal storage diseases, such as GM1‐gangliosidosis, Gaucher disease, and Niemann‐Pick disease (Ferreira & Gahl, <xref rid=""mgg31677-bib-0005"" ref-type=""ref"">2017</xref>; Kaback & Desnick, <xref rid=""mgg31677-bib-0008"" ref-type=""ref"">2011</xref>). Currently, more than 130 mutations in the <italic toggle=""yes"">HEXA</italic> gene associated with TSD have been identified worldwide (Mistri et al., <xref rid=""mgg31677-bib-0012"" ref-type=""ref"">2012</xref>). Among these, six mutations were most commonly found. This includes the following: three null alleles (NM_000520.6:c.1073+1G>A, c.1421+1G>C, c.1274_1277dupTATC) that causes infantile form TSD, one allele associated with the adult onset form, NM_000520.6:c.805G>A (p.Gly269Ser), and two pseudo‐deficiency alleles,NM_000520.6:c.739C>T (p.Arg247Trp), c.745C>T (p.Arg249Trp), that are not associated with HEXA deficiency itself, but with falsely lowered levels of HEXA activity during enzyme activity assay using synthetic substrate (Kaback & Desnick, <xref rid=""mgg31677-bib-0008"" ref-type=""ref"">2011</xref>). The type and frequency of mutations vary greatly across different ethnic groups. In Ashkenazi Jew populations, the most common mutations of <italic toggle=""yes"">HEXA</italic> are NM_000520.6:c.1421+1G>C, c.1274_1277dupTATC (p.Tyr427Ilefs*5), c.805G>A (p.Gly269Ser), where the first two are null alleles and the third being associated with the later‐onset form (Kaback & Desnick, <xref rid=""mgg31677-bib-0008"" ref-type=""ref"">2011</xref>). On the other hand, the most common variant in French Canadians is a 7.6 kb deletion, including exon 1 and the promoter of <italic toggle=""yes"">HEXA</italic> gene, and in about 80% of Japanese TSD patients, the NM_000520.6:c.571‐1G>T variant has been found (Tanaka et al., <xref rid=""mgg31677-bib-0014"" ref-type=""ref"">1993</xref>). Two out of three from our independent TSD patients also had NM_000520.6:c.571‐1G>T, which could be a frequent allele among Far East Asian populations. Another mutation found in patient 1, NM_000520.6:c.1168C>T (p.Gln390*), is a previously documented pathogenic mutation (Akerman et al., <xref rid=""mgg31677-bib-0001"" ref-type=""ref"">1997</xref>). Additionally, we found two novel and likely pathogenic variants in this study: NM_000520.6:c.488A>G (p.Asp163Gly) and c.965A>G (p.Asp322Gly). NM_000520.6:c.488A>G (p.Asp163Gly) found in patient 2 is located in the chitobiase/beta‐hexosaminidase domain 2‐like region; meanwhile, NM_000520.6:c.965A>G (p.Asp322Gly) found in patient 3is located in the glycoside hydrolase family 20 catalytic domain. Both are well‐established functional domains (PM1), and there have been previous reports from India of a pathogenic variant at the same codon, p.Asp322 Tyr (Mistri et al., <xref rid=""mgg31677-bib-0012"" ref-type=""ref"">2012</xref>) (PM5 for patient 3). Also, these novel variants could not be found in well‐known population databases such as ExAC, 1000G, and gnomAD (PM2). All identified variants were in trans from the parents’ analyses (PM3 for patient 2). From in silico analysis using Pymolsoftware (<ext-link ext-link-type=""uri"" http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink href=""http://www.pymol.org"">http://www.pymol.org</ext-link>), p.Asp163 and p.Asp322 were estimated to be adjacent to the location of the reported pathogenic variants on ClinVar database (<ext-link ext-link-type=""uri"" http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/clinvar"">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/clinvar</ext-link>) (Figure <xref rid=""mgg31677-fig-0003"" ref-type=""fig"">3d</xref>). Interestingly, the residual HEXA activity was only mildly decreased (29.0%–44.6%) for all three patients, as opposed to other studies where infantile form TSD patients have markedly low levels of HEXA activity. However, the phenotypes of our patients were suggestive of infantile TSD. In Korea, TSD is extremely rare. Only a couple of centers could measure HEXA activity, and the internal data of positive controls might be limited. Hence, reassessment of the reference range is required by including our three patients as positive controls. A previous article from Japan also reported that the HEXA activity that were determined by heat inactivating procedure was generally much higher compared to the Jewish infantile form TSD patients (Tanaka et al., <xref rid=""mgg31677-bib-0014"" ref-type=""ref"">1993</xref>). The article presented 24 infantile TSD patients and 23 patients were revealed to have the c.571‐1G>T mutation, either heterozygously or homozygously. Average HEXA activity of the 23 patients was approximately 10.5%. The c.571‐1G>T mutation, which is found in 80% of Japanese patients, generated a mutant mRNA with skipping of exon 6. The authors also suggested that a frame shift did not occur because exon 6 only consisted of 102 base pairs; therefore, it generates a rather stable mutant mRNA and creates a stable α‐subunit of HEXA (Tanaka et al., <xref rid=""mgg31677-bib-0014"" ref-type=""ref"">1993</xref>). In our report, patient 1 and patient 2, who have the heterozygous c.571‐1G>T mutation, have residual HEXA levels over 40%, which is higher compared to that of patient 3, who does not have the c.571‐1G>T mutation. Additionally, a previous report presented a patient with HEXA activity of 0% and genetic analysis revealed the c.1168C>T mutation, which was also found patient 1 of our report (Jin et al., <xref rid=""mgg31677-bib-0007"" ref-type=""ref"">2004</xref>). This suggests that quality control and standardization of inter‐laboratory and inter‐method difference is necessary using more positive and negative control samples. Currently, there is no known curative therapy for TSD. Thus, majority of treatments are based on relieving neurological symptoms. However, there have been several attempts to manage the disease itself which have been mostly used in preclinical research. This includes enzyme replacement therapy, substrate reduction therapy, bone marrow transplantation, and gene therapy (Solovyeva et al., <xref rid=""mgg31677-bib-0013"" ref-type=""ref"">2018</xref>). Enzyme replacement therapy has already been known to be effective for several lysosomal storage diseases. Animal studies, performed using mice with Sandhoff disease, have shown some probability, and the use of recombinant HEXA increased motor function and survival rate (Tsuji et al., <xref rid=""mgg31677-bib-0015"" ref-type=""ref"">2011</xref>). In addition, intraventricular administration of chimeric HEXB has shown to restore HEXA activity and reduce GM2‐gangliosides in mice (Matsuoka et al., <xref rid=""mgg31677-bib-0011"" ref-type=""ref"">2011</xref>). Substrate reduction therapy has been introduced to prevent the accumulation of certain substances by the suppression of a proximal enzyme involved in the synthesis of these substances. N‐butyldeoxynojirimycin, a drug used for type 1 Gaucher disease, has been shown to prevent GM2‐ganglioside accumulation in TSD mice (Bembi et al., <xref rid=""mgg31677-bib-0002"" ref-type=""ref"">2006</xref>). However, the neurological symptoms and signs did not improve in human TSD cases (Bembi et al., <xref rid=""mgg31677-bib-0002"" ref-type=""ref"">2006</xref>). Although bone marrow transplantation along with N‐butyldeoxynojirimycin intake showed an increase in HEXA activity in the plasma and leukocytes for a child with TSD, it was unable to prevent the progression of neurological dysfunction (Jacobs et al., <xref rid=""mgg31677-bib-0006"" ref-type=""ref"">2005</xref>). Gene therapy, which uses viral vectors to deliver DNA encoding α‐subunit and β‐subunit of <italic toggle=""yes"">HEXA</italic>, is being developed and tested in mice. However, these studies have not yet been applied to humans, and effective delivery across the blood‐brain barrier and adequate function in the brain remains a challenge (Solovyeva et al., <xref rid=""mgg31677-bib-0013"" ref-type=""ref"">2018</xref>). GM2‐gangliosidosis including TSD should be considered in children presented with neurodevelopmental delay, regression, and upper motor neuron signs. Similarly, a retinal examination could also be helpful for timely diagnosis. Advancements in genetic testing have led to the discovery of many variants associated with TSD and their relation to ethnicity. However, further studies can be performed to understand the origin of specific mutations in certain populations and to explain the relatively high levels of HEXA activity in Far East Asian TSD patients. The Institutional Review Board of Seoul National University Hospital approved this study (H‐1904‐054‐1027). The study was performed in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki and written informed consent for molecular study and publication was obtained from the parents.

Late‐Onset Tay‐Sachs Disease in an Irish Family,,Full text not available in PMC,N/A,28 10 2020
GM2 ganglioside accumulation causes neuroinflammation and behavioral alterations in a mouse model of early onset Tay-Sachs disease,,"Tay-Sachs disease (TSD) is a fatal inherited lysosomal storage disorder, principally affecting the brain, which leads to neurological dysfunction. TSD is caused by mutations in the <italic toggle=""yes"">Hexa</italic> gene, which encodes the <italic toggle=""yes"">α</italic> subunit of lysosomal β-hexosaminidase α (HEXA), an enzyme that converts GM2 to GM3 ganglioside [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR1"">1</xref>, <xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR2"">2</xref>]. Infants with TSD appear healthy at birth, but progressive GM2 accumulation causes loss of motor function and cognition, developmental regression, dystonia, blindness, seizures, and death in childhood [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR1"">1</xref>]. Unlike in TSD patients, the phenotype of <italic toggle=""yes"">Hexa−/−</italic> knockout (KO) mice was nearly normal, with limited ganglioside storage in the nervous system [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR1"">1</xref>–<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR3"">3</xref>]. This result was due to a metabolic bypass in <italic toggle=""yes"">Hexa−/−</italic> mice, specifically in the NEU3 sialidase-mediated hydrolysis of sialic acid from stored GM2, yielding GA2 ganglioside, which is further degraded by the functional HEXB [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR3"">3</xref>, <xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR4"">4</xref>]. Early onset Tay-Sachs disease mouse model (<italic toggle=""yes"">Hexa−/−</italic> and <italic toggle=""yes"">Neu3−/−</italic>) mice was generated by crossing of <italic toggle=""yes"">Hexa−/−</italic> and <italic toggle=""yes"">Neu3−/−</italic> mice to investigate the role of NEU3 sialidase in GM2 ganglioside degradation [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR5"">5</xref>]. These mice were healthy at birth, but died at 1.5 to 4.5 months of age, showing a similar progression of a very short lifespan like Tay-Sachs patients. It has been shown that abnormal accumulation of GM2 ganglioside in neurons leads to cytoplasmic vacuolation and progressive neurodegeneration, resulting in neuronal death, Purkinje cell depletion, and astrogliosis. <italic toggle=""yes"">Hexa−</italic>/<italic toggle=""yes"">−Neu3−</italic>/<italic toggle=""yes"">−</italic> mice also exhibited neurobehavioral abnormalities, such as growth delay, abnormalities in the skeletal bones, slow movement, ataxia, and tremors. Consequently, the <italic toggle=""yes"">Hexa−</italic>/<italic toggle=""yes"">−Neu3</italic>−/<italic toggle=""yes"">−</italic> mouse model mimics the pathological, biochemical, and clinical abnormalities of the Tay-Sachs patients, and is particularly useful to further understand the pathogenesis, and cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying the progression of TSD [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR5"">5</xref>]. A previous study showed that storage of GM1 and GM2 gangliosides in the CNS led to microgliosis and astrogliosis, and that the degree of inflammation is correlated with increased levels of ganglioside accumulation. While inflammation markers including inflammatory cytokines (TNFα, IL1β, and TGFβ1) were absent in <italic toggle=""yes"">Hexa</italic>−<italic toggle=""yes"">/</italic>− mice, they were significantly expressed in the <italic toggle=""yes"">Hexb</italic>−/− mouse model of Sandhoff disease, GM1 gangliosidosis mouse model [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR6"">6</xref>], and GM2 gangliosidosis patients [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR7"">7</xref>]. Activation of microglia and astrocytes resulted in the production of inflammatory mediators [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR8"">8</xref>]. For instance, the levels of TNF-α pro-inflammatory cytokine were significantly increased in the cerebrospinal fluid of TSD patients [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR9"">9</xref>]. In addition, five inflammation biomarkers, ENA-78, MCP-1, MIP-1α, MIP-1β, and TNFR2 were also detected in the cerebrospinal fluid of patients with infantile and juvenile gangliosidosis [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR10"">10</xref>]. Various lysosomal storage disorders including Niemann–Pick type C disease [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR11"">11</xref>], Gaucher disease [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR12"">12</xref>], mucopolysaccharidosis type I, IIIA, and III [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR13"">13</xref>], and neuronal ceroid-lipofuscinoses [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR14"">14</xref>] also exhibit neuropathological alterations such as prominent microglial and astrocyte activation. A previous study showed that <italic toggle=""yes"">Hexa</italic>−/−<italic toggle=""yes"">Neu3</italic>−/− mice exhibited an inflammatory response, with astrogliosis, in the hippocampus, cortex, and cerebellum [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR5"">5</xref>]. In this work, we aimed to further investigate the neuroinflammatory response to GM2 accumulation in the brain and retina of <italic toggle=""yes"">Hexa</italic>−/−<italic toggle=""yes"">Neu3</italic>−/− mice, and its effect on behavior during the progression of disease<bold>.</bold>   Neuroinflammation is a common hallmark in the pathogenesis of several lysosomal storage disorders including GM2 gangliosidosis, and may negatively impact neuronal survival [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR17"">17</xref>, <xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR19"">19</xref>]. In a previous study, we showed that severe neuronal apoptosis and astrogliosis in the hippocampus, cortex, and thalamus of <italic toggle=""yes"">Hexa</italic>−/−<italic toggle=""yes"">Neu3</italic>−/− mice correlated with undegraded GM2 ganglioside accumulation [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR5"">5</xref>]. However, the mechanism of disease progression relevant to neuroinflammation was not yet elucidated. In the present work, we focused on investigating the age-dependent mediators of neuroinflammation in <italic toggle=""yes"">Hexa</italic>−/−<italic toggle=""yes"">Neu3</italic>−/− mice for future therapeutic studies. It has been shown that the accumulation of undegraded gangliosides is linked to activation of microglial cells [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR30"">30</xref>, <xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR17"">17</xref>]. Here, we demonstrated that an accumulation of GM2 ganglioside led to the activation of the microglial/macrophage system in the brain and retina of <italic toggle=""yes"">Hexa</italic>−/−<italic toggle=""yes"">Neu3</italic>−/− mice, compared with that in age-matched <italic toggle=""yes"">WT</italic>, <italic toggle=""yes"">Hexa</italic>−/−, and <italic toggle=""yes"">Neu3</italic>−/− mice. Activation of this cellular system led to an altered expression profile of both pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines, as well as chemokines, in the cortex and cerebellum. We found that while pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines, such as Ccl2, Ccl3, Ccl4, and Cxcl10 were significantly upregulated in the brain of <italic toggle=""yes"">Hexa</italic>−/−<italic toggle=""yes"">Neu3</italic>−/− compared with that in <italic toggle=""yes"">Hexa</italic>−/− mice, anti-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines such as IL10, IL13, IL11, and IL24 were significantly downregulated (Fig. <xref rid=""Fig1"" ref-type=""fig"">1</xref>). It has been shown that the simultaneous increase of Ccl2, Ccl3, and Ccl5 in mice brain leads to epileptic seizures. Importantly, their elevated levels may account for the neuroinflammation and the seizure activity observed in the neuropathology of the early onset Tay-Sachs disease mouse model. Furthermore, these cytokines play a role in the attraction, migration, and activation of monocytes, lymphocytes, and neutrophils in the CNS [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR18"">18</xref>, <xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR24"">24</xref>, <xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR25"">25</xref>]. Their increased levels in the CNS of <italic toggle=""yes"">Hexa</italic>−/−<italic toggle=""yes"">Neu3</italic>−/− mice triggered PBMC infiltration similar to the Sandhoff mouse model. This may suggest that inhibition of PBMC infiltration may delay disease progression and neurodegeneration in <italic toggle=""yes"">Hexa</italic>−/−<italic toggle=""yes"">Neu3</italic>−/− mice, similar to the <italic toggle=""yes"">Hexb</italic>−/−<italic toggle=""yes"">Ccl2</italic>−/− mice [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR36"">36</xref>]. Moreover, it was reported that the deletion of the <italic toggle=""yes"">Ccl3</italic> gene caused a delay of neuronal loss in Sandhoff mice (<italic toggle=""yes"">Hexb</italic>−/−<italic toggle=""yes"">Mip1α</italic>−/− mice) by inhibiting macrophage infiltration to the inflammatory sites, which resulted in an improved neurologic status and a longer lifespan [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR37"">37</xref>]. Additionally, <italic toggle=""yes"">Hexb</italic>−/−<italic toggle=""yes"">Tnfα</italic>−/− mice displayed a delayed neurodegenerative cascade by an extending lifespan, improving sensorimotor coordination, decreasing levels of astrogliosis and neuronal cell death [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR49"">49</xref>]. We suggest that antagonists of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines such as Ccl3 or Ccl4 may dampen neuroinflammation and improve disease outcomes in <italic toggle=""yes"">Hexa</italic>−/−<italic toggle=""yes"">Neu3</italic>−/− mice. Activated microglia produce various pro-inflammatory mediators, chemokines, and cytokines which negatively impact neurons and oligodendrocytes [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR39"">39</xref>]. Here, we showed that <italic toggle=""yes"">Hexa</italic>−/−<italic toggle=""yes"">Neu3</italic>−/− mice exhibited a significant loss in neuronal density and oligodendrocytes. These results are consistent with the previous research indicating increased apoptotic cell death in the brain of <italic toggle=""yes"">Hexa</italic>−/−<italic toggle=""yes"">Neu3</italic>−/− mice [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR5"">5</xref>]. Increased level of Lif under inflammatory conditions has been shown to inhibit cell proliferation [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR50"">50</xref>], a similar increase was observed in the cortex of <italic toggle=""yes"">Hexa</italic>−/−<italic toggle=""yes"">Neu3</italic>−/− mice. Furthermore, transcription levels of IL 11, whose overexpression has been shown to inhibit demyelinization by protecting oligodendrocytes [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR51"">51</xref>], were significantly reduced in both the cortex and cerebellum of <italic toggle=""yes"">Hexa</italic>−/−<italic toggle=""yes"">Neu3</italic>−/− mice compared with that in <italic toggle=""yes"">Hexa</italic>−/− mice. The Bmp protein family is responsible for the regulation of bone formation, maintenance, and repair [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR52"">52</xref>]. Relatively low expression of Bmp 2, 4, 6, and 7 may be a contributing factor to the hunched posture observed in <italic toggle=""yes"">Hexa</italic>−/−<italic toggle=""yes"">Neu3</italic>−/− mice [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR5"">5</xref>]. Furthermore, Csf3 is responsible for the production and differentiation of granulocytes and is involved in defense against pathogens. Relatively low expression of Csf3 might result in the predisposition of <italic toggle=""yes"">Hexa</italic>−/−<italic toggle=""yes"">Neu3</italic>−/− mice to bacterial infection which requires further investigation. Deficiencies in memory, spatial and cognitive learning in Hexa−/−Neu3−/− mice, demonstrated by the Morris water maze and passive avoidance tests, might be related to abnormal GM2 accumulation in CNS as well as reduction in neuronal density and oligodendrocytes [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR30"">30</xref>, <xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR39"">39</xref>]. Additionally, deficits in memory and learning might be related to impaired hippocampal function, which is involved in spatial and/or temporal processing of memory [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR53"">53</xref>], deterioration of Purkinje cells, which play a role in spatial navigation [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR5"">5</xref>, <xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR54"">54</xref>], and/or damaged retrosplenial and secondary motor cortices, which are involved in memory, navigation, and control of movement [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR55"">55</xref>]. Memory impairments in <italic toggle=""yes"">Hexa</italic>−/−<italic toggle=""yes"">Neu3</italic>−/− mice, observed in the passive avoidance test, might also be accounted for by a decreased sensitivity to electric shock, due to damage in primary motor and somatosensory cortices, which are regions that process pain control [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR56"">56</xref>]. The swimming speeds of 2.5- and 4.5-month-old <italic toggle=""yes"">Hexa</italic>−/−<italic toggle=""yes"">Neu3</italic>−/− mice were significantly lower than those of age-matched control groups, although they move equal distances to find the target platform (Fig. <xref rid=""Fig7"" ref-type=""fig"">7</xref>). These data suggest that Hexa−/−Neu3−/− mice may not be able to learn the location of the hidden platform due to the memory impairment and damaged signaling pathways in the CNS. In conclusion, our data suggest that abnormal GM2 ganglioside accumulation in the CNS of early onset Tay-Sachs disease mouse model activates neuroinflammation, by triggering the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines, microgliosis, astrogliosis, and the infiltration of PBMC in the CNS. This inflammatory cascade results in a loss of neurons and oligodendrocytes. Our behavioral assessment identified abnormalities in behavior consistent with an important contribution of neuroinflammatory processes to subsequent neural dysfunctions. These observations collectively suggest that modulation of Ccl2, Ccl3, and Cxcl10 or of their receptors, as a potential therapeutic targets to slow down Tay-Sachs disease. ",N/A,20 9 2020

A study in (1975) by Beutler et al. decided that TSD is acquired by changing in the <italic toggle=""yes"">HEXA</italic> gene causing a dysfunctional in Hexosaminidase A (alpha polypeptide) enzyme.<xref rid=""ref6"" ref-type=""bibr"">6</xref> Total of 78 mutations in the <italic toggle=""yes"">HEXA</italic> gene was reported containing 65 point mutation, 13 indel mutations along with 45 missense mutations leading to the Tay-Sachs caused by point mutations.<xref rid=""ref7"" ref-type=""bibr"">7</xref> Also they found six nonsense mutation and 14 splice site lesions caused by point mutation. In addition to that frame shift mutation can led to TSD, eight cases were reported (6 deletion, 2 insertion), one of the insertion cases within exon 11 four base pair were inserted, this type of mutation showed in 80% in the carriers of TSD from the Ashkenazi Jewish population. A lagre deletion in exon1 found in French Canadian patient, maybe the main cause of TSD, while Most of the other changing are limited to single pedigrees.<xref rid=""ref7"" ref-type=""bibr"">7</xref> A study was published in (2002) by McGinniss et al. recognized 8 novel mutation in the <italic toggle=""yes"">HEXA</italic> gene, in addition to that, they found 31 mutation in 49 subjects.<xref rid=""ref8"" ref-type=""bibr"">8</xref> Tanaka et al. (1990) studied 7 patients with TSD caused by a specific enzymologic characteristic of B1 variant of TSD. This variation has been considered a normal catalytic activity on certain synthetic substrates, but defective catalytic activity against natural substrates, including GM2 gangliosides.<xref rid=""ref9"" ref-type=""bibr"">9</xref> More or less all cases, but one from Czechoslovakia, have exactly the same arg178-to-his mutation. The Czechoslovakian case had change in the same codon but the alteration of nucleotide 532 from C to T change the amino acid from Arginine to Cytosin and this cause a protein dysfunction. As well as 136 consanguineous families screened by next generation sequencing they found that 90% Iranian and less than 10% Turkish or Arabic have syndromic or nonsyndromic in the forms of autosomal recessive intellectual disability.<xref rid=""ref9"" ref-type=""bibr"">9</xref> A missense mutation was discovered in a family by Najmabadi et al. (2011) in which the first-cousin parents had 8 children 3 of them has moderate symptoms while the rest were healthy.<xref rid=""ref10"" ref-type=""bibr"">10</xref> Here in this study we report a homozygous nonsense mutation c.1177C>T, p.Arg393Ter as a result in protein change in <italic toggle=""yes"">HEXA</italic> gene for the first time in Saudi Family. Our findings further expand the role of WES in efficient tool for disease diagnosis in Arab families and explained that the mutation in <italic toggle=""yes"">HEXA</italic> gene may plays an important role and it will further help to understand the development of TSD syndrome.",N/A,Sep-Oct 2020
Unusual case of Juvenile Tay-Sachs disease,Tay-Sachs disease (TSD) is a type 1 gangliosidosis (GM2) and caused by hexosaminidase A deficiency resulting in abnormal sphingolipid metabolism and deposition of precursors in different organs. It is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder transmitted in an autosomal-recessive manner. There is an accumulation of GM2 in neurocytes and retinal ganglions which result in progressive loss of neurological function and formation of the cherry-red spot which is the hallmark of TSD. We report the first case of juvenile TSD from Pakistan in a child with death of an older sibling without the diagnosis.,Full text not available in PMC,N/A,2019
