HbA1c or fructosamine on evaluating glucose intolerance in children with beta- thalassemia,,"Beta-thalassemia major (β-TM) is the most common genetic disorder of hemoglobinopathies characterized by reduced or absent production of the beta-globin chain that results in ineffective erythropoiesis which results in chronic hemolytic anemia and blood transfusion dependency.<sup><xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR1"">1</xref></sup> Iron overload related to regular blood transfusion can cause multiple organ damage like cardiomyopathy, liver cirrhosis, arthritis, and endocrine disorders such as diabetes mellitus. Moreover, older age, more frequent blood transfusions, the type and dosage of iron-chelating therapy, high serum ferritin, a family history of diabetes mellitus, hepatic impairment, and genetic iron overload modifiers are suggested risk factors for the development of diabetes mellitus in individuals with β-TM.<sup><xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR2"">2</xref></sup> A meta-analysis study reported a prevalence of 17.21%, 12.46%, and 6.54% for impaired fasting glucose, impaired glucose tolerance and established diabetes mellitus in patients with β-TM, respectively.<sup><xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR3"">3</xref></sup> However, the precise mechanisms causing the transition from normoglycemia to overt diabetes are still not well known. A growing amount of research shows that both insulin resistance and the direct toxic effects of iron on pancreatic beta cells and their insulin secretory ability are both involved in the development of diabetes mellitus with β-TM.<sup><xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR4"">4</xref></sup> It’s well known that hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) can reflect the average blood glucose status from the previous 2 to 3 months, however, fructosamine a byproduct of the non-enzymatic interaction between glucose and proteins has been suggested as a substitute for HbA1c and can reflect blood glucose status over last 2 to 3 weeks. Additionally, the American Diabetes Association (ADA) suggests the use of fructosamine in patients with hemolytic anemia and hemoglobinopathies being known to be unaffected by erythrocyte life duration, erythropoiesis, and hemoglobin level.<sup><xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR5"">5</xref>,<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR6"">6</xref></sup> Another biomarker for short-term (2–3 weeks) glycemic control is glycated albumin (GA), a non-enzymatic glycation product of circulating albumin. GA is more reliable than Hb A1c to evaluate glycemic variability as its levels are not affected by any hemolytic processes, and more advantageous to fructosamine, as it is not influenced by other serum proteins.<sup><xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR7"">7</xref></sup> Also, GA may help the early detection of gestational diabetes mellitus with short-term glycemic monitoring and stratifying the risk of complications in these patients.<sup><xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR8"">8</xref>,<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR9"">9</xref></sup> Diverse studies offer conflicting perspectives on this matter, so this study aimed to evaluate glucose intolerance in children with β-TM and investigate the role of HbA1c, fructosamine, insulin resistance index (HOMA-IR), and insulin sensitivity index (HOMA-IS) in these patients.  Demographic, clinical criteria and laboratory data of the study groups were presented in Table <xref rid=""Tab1"" ref-type=""table"">1</xref>. There was no statistically significant difference between patients and controls regarding age (11.49 ± 1.71 years versus 11.77 ± 2.30 years) and sex (males 59%, females 41% versus 55% and 45%) respectively. Positive consanguinity was highly statistically significant in patients compared to controls, (<italic toggle=""yes"">p</italic> < 0.001). Regarding the laboratory data, patients showed a highly statistically significant decrease in hemoglobin levels. A highly statistically significant increase in HbA1c, fructosamine, fasting plasma glucose (FPG), fasting insulin level (FINS), and insulin resistance index (HOMA-IR), was detected in patients compared to controls (<italic toggle=""yes"">p</italic> < 0.001). Conversely, insulin sensitivity index (HOMA-IS) was statistically lower in patients compared to controls (<italic toggle=""yes"">p</italic> < 0.001).<table-wrap id=""Tab1""><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Demographic, clinical criteria, and laboratory data of the studied groups.</p></caption><table frame=""hsides"" rules=""groups""><thead><tr><th>Data</th><th>Patients (<italic toggle=""yes"">n</italic> = 100)</th><th>Controls (<italic toggle=""yes"">n</italic> = 100)</th><th><italic toggle=""yes"">P</italic>-value</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Age (year) Mean ± SD</td><td>11.49 ± 1.71</td><td>11.77 ± 2.30</td><td>0.330</td></tr><tr><td colspan=""4"">Sex</td></tr><tr><td> Male</td><td>41 (41.0%)</td><td>45 (45.0%)</td><td rowspan=""2"">0.568</td></tr><tr><td> Female</td><td>59 (59.0%)</td><td>55 (55.0%)</td></tr><tr><td>Consanguinity</td><td>64 (64.0%)</td><td>30 (30.0%)</td><td><0.001**</td></tr><tr><td>Height Z-score Mean ± SD</td><td>−1.36 ± 0.97</td><td>0.59 ± 0.75</td><td><0.001**</td></tr><tr><td>Weight Z-score Mean ± SD</td><td>−0.97 ± 1.48</td><td>0.65 ± 0.56</td><td><0.001**</td></tr><tr><td>BMI Z-score Mean ± SD</td><td>−0.74 ± 2.67</td><td>0.12 ± 0.76</td><td>0.002*</td></tr><tr><td>Hemoglobin (g/dl) Mean ± SD</td><td>7.19 ± 1.12</td><td>12.38 ± 1.39</td><td><0.001**</td></tr><tr><td>Platelet count (× 10<sup>9</sup>/L) Mean ± SD</td><td>310.26 ± 129.37</td><td>235.74 ± 69.34</td><td><0.001**</td></tr><tr><td>White blood cell count (× 10<sup>9</sup>/L) Mean ± SD</td><td>9.56 ± 5.03</td><td>8.39 ± 2.22</td><td>0.035*</td></tr><tr><td>HbA1c (%) Mean ± SD</td><td>6.12 ± 0.84</td><td>4.99 ± 0.66</td><td><0.001**</td></tr><tr><td>Serum fructosamine (mmol/L) Mean ± SD</td><td>2.86 ± 0.45</td><td>2.34 ± 0.15</td><td><0.001**</td></tr><tr><td>Fasting plasma glucose (mg/dl) Mean ± SD</td><td>103.37 ± 22.95</td><td>79.01 ± 7.38</td><td><0.001**</td></tr><tr><td>Fasting insulin level (mIU/L) Mean ± SD</td><td>9.40 ± 2.96</td><td>5.04 ± 1.38</td><td><0.001**</td></tr><tr><td>HOMA-IR Mean ± SD</td><td>2.32 ± 1.12</td><td>1.01 ± 0.36</td><td><0.001**</td></tr><tr><td>HOMA-IS Mean ± SD</td><td>0.51 ± 0.23</td><td>1.20 ± 0.72</td><td><0.001**</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><p><italic toggle=""yes"">HOMA-IR</italic> Homeostatic Model Assessment for insulin resistance, <italic toggle=""yes"">HOMA-IS</italic> Homeostatic Model Assessment for insulin sensitivity, <italic toggle=""yes"">SD</italic> Standard deviation.</p><p>*Statistically significant at <italic toggle=""yes"">p</italic> < 0.05, **highly Statistically significant at <italic toggle=""yes"">p</italic> < 0.001.</p></table-wrap-foot></table-wrap> According to FPG and 2-h post-prandial blood glucose (2-h PG), 49 patients (49%) were glucose tolerant, and 51 patients (51%) were glucose intolerant (32 patients had prediabetes state and 19 patients revealed diabetes mellitus).

The role of fructosamine over HbA1c has been highlighted in β-TM patients being analyzed in a similar way to serum proteins rather than HbA1c which might get affected in thalassemia by other factors, such as erythropoiesis, hemoglobin disease, glycosylation levels, and erythrocyte longevity.<sup><xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR14"">14</xref></sup> According to the American Diabetes Association, diagnosis of diabetes mellitus could be made with HbA1c ≥ 6.5% and prediabetes range at HbA1c 5.7% to 6.4%. Furthermore, the normal ranges for fructosamine in non-diabetes mellitus individuals are 2.0 to 2.85 mmol/L.<sup><xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR14"">14</xref></sup> Unlike HbA1c, there is no reference point for fructosamine at which diabetes mellitus diagnosis could be made. In this study, HbA1c and fructosamine were statistically significantly higher in β-TM patients compared to controls and in the glucose intolerant patients than in glucose tolerant ones. Glucose intolerance was documented in 72% of patients with HbA1c % ≥5.7, compared to 40% with fructosamine >2.85 mmol/L, in both 18 patients (18%) were confirmed to have diabetes mellitus based on FPG level and 2-h PG, representing 25% with HbA1c detection compared to 45% with fructosamine detection. Our results documented HbA1c cut-off point >5.9% to detect prediabetes state and >6.87% to detect established diabetes mellitus in our patients which were close to known reference ranges. On the other hand, fructosamine levels documented a cut-off point >2.78 mmol/L to detect prediabetes state and a cut-off point >3 mmol/L to detect established diabetes mellitus in our patients recognizing that no established fructosamine reference range indicates whether a person has diabetes or not. Furthermore, fructosamine was more specific with a higher PPV in detecting prediabetes state and more sensitive with a higher NPV in identifying diabetes mellitus in our patients when compared to HbA1c. A comparable study in adults by Malmström et al.<sup><xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR15"">15</xref></sup> determined that a threshold level of 2.5 mmol/L of fructosamine was found to be effective in differentiating subjects with and without diabetes. Selvin et al.<sup><xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR16"">16</xref></sup> reported an adjusted hazard ratio of 4.96 for incident diabetes for those with fructosamine levels >2.64 mmol/L compared to those below 2.41 mmol/L. An adult study by Choudhary et al.<sup><xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR17"">17</xref></sup> and a pediatric study by Gomber et al.<sup><xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR13"">13</xref></sup> pointed out that β-TM patients may have higher baseline values of HbA1c limiting its diagnostic ability for diabetes mellitus. Despite this, HbA1c continues to be a good marker for worsening glucose homeostasis. A pediatric study by Ji et al.<sup><xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR18"">18</xref></sup> and an adult study by Gluvic et al.<sup><xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR19"">19</xref></sup> suggested measuring HbA1c using a different technique, such as the Capillary’s 2 Flex Piercing System, or measuring HbA1c and fructosamine at the same time to evaluate glycemic status in β-TM patients. A pediatric study by Kosaryan et al.<sup><xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR20"">20</xref></sup> reported that mean fructosamine had a substantial correlation with blood glucose and was a more reliable measure of retrograde glycemic levels than HbA1c in individuals with β-TM. Other studies in adults and children illustrated that for evaluating glycemic control over an extended period (two to three months), serum HbA1c is the preferred metric, however, fructosamine may be a valuable and reliable diagnostic biomarker and of exceptional use in some conditions when HbA1c is insufficient. Additionally, as it offers data on short-term glycemic control, it is anticipated to represent poor glycemic control more accurately than HbA1c.<sup><xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR21"">21</xref>,<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR22"">22</xref></sup> In this study, insulin resistance index (HOMA-IR) and fasting insulin levels were statistically significantly higher in patients than in controls and glucose intolerant patients when compared to normal ones. Furthermore, insulin sensitivity index (HOMA-IS) was statistically significantly less in patients than in controls and in glucose intolerant patients than in normal ones. Therefore, insulin resistance in β-TM patients is the cornerstone for abnormal glucose tolerance than insulin deficiency. Similarly, various studies in pediatrics reported that HOMA-IR was greater in β-TM patients who either had diabetes mellitus or prediabetes in comparison to the euglycemic patients. Others highlighted that acute increases in serum ferritin following blood transfusion in those patients may contribute to an increase in insulin secretion and insulin resistance.<sup><xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR6"">6</xref>,<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR23"">23</xref></sup> Gomber et al.<sup><xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR13"">13</xref></sup> observed that β-TM children with HOMA-IR ≥ 2.5 were risk 16.4 times of developing impaired glucose tolerance. Therefore, various studies in children highlighted the importance of frequently assessing blood glycemic status in β-TM patients, especially those above the age of 10 who should receive an annual FPG level and oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT), for early diagnosis and active intervention of glucose intolerance.<sup><xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR2"">2</xref>,<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR6"">6</xref>,<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR24"">24</xref></sup> Iron overload adversely affects glucose metabolism. It has been observed that the incidence of diabetes mellitus in children with serum ferritin >2500 μg/L was 3.53 times higher than that in patients with serum ferritin between 1000–2500 μg/L, and the reduction of serum ferritin could improve the secretion function of beta cells.<sup><xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR25"">25</xref></sup> In this study, serum ferritin was statistically significantly higher in glucose intolerant patients compared to normal ones, and in patients with diabetes compared to prediabetes or glucose tolerant patients. There was a statistically significant positive correlation between serum ferritin and age of patients, HbA1c, fructosamine, FPG level, 2-h PG, FINS level, HOMA-IR, and transfusion index. Furthermore, our results determined that at a cut-off point >3325 μg/L for serum ferritin, β-TM patients are more liable to have diabetes mellitus. In the same context, Liang et al.<sup><xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR26"">26</xref></sup> demonstrated that β-TM children with impaired fasting glucose levels were significantly older and had higher FINS, HOMA-IR, and a significantly lesser HOMA-IS than those with normal fasting glucose levels. The limitation of this study was a small sample size so; further large-scale prospective studies need to be carried out in this regard to validate the results of this study. Overt and preclinical abnormal glucose tolerance is relatively common in β-TM, mainly due to developing insulin resistance with their prevalence increasing with age or longer duration of the disease and poor compliance to chelation therapy. HbA1c and fructosamine are valuable in evaluating the blood glucose status in β-TM children, and however, HbA1c is a reliable indicator of deteriorating glucose metabolism, fructosamine is an uprising alternative indicator of glucose status, which requires further studies for confirmation.

We analyzed patients with intermediate and severe β-thalassemia treated at our hospital from February 2019 to February 2024. Patients who received treatment for more than 3 months were included. The efficacy of thalidomide was assessed by comparing changes in hemoglobin (Hb), ferritin, bilirubin, and Hb electrophoresis before and after treatment. Adverse drug reactions during treatment were also recorded. A total of 42 β-thalassemia patients were included, with thalidomide dosages ranging from 75 to 150 mg/d. The response rates at 1, 3, and 6 months of treatment were 73.8% (31/42), 75.0% (24/32), and 94.7% (18/19), respectively. The increase in Hb levels was primarily attributed to fetal hemoglobin (HbF). After 1 month of treatment, the HbF percentage increased from a baseline of 34.04 ± 27.58% to 56.25 ± 28.40% (<italic toggle=""yes"">P</italic> < .001). At 3 and 6 months, HbF further increased to 67.21 ± 27.12% (<italic toggle=""yes"">P</italic> < .001) and 73.93 ± 22.96% (<italic toggle=""yes"">P</italic> < .001), respectively. The average duration of thalidomide treatment was 25.3 ± 9.2 months (range: 4–60 months), with 6 patients treated for over 60 months and 18 patients for over 48 months. Two homozygous patients who failed thalidomide treatment achieved Hb levels above 100 g/L and discontinued transfusion therapy after 3 months of hydroxyurea treatment. The most common adverse reaction was somnolence, which was mild and tolerable. Thalidomide demonstrates significant and sustained therapeutic effects in β-thalassemia patients. The adverse reactions are mild and tolerable, allowing patients to continue treatment.","β-Thalassemia is 1 of the most common monogenic hereditary blood disorders worldwide. It is caused by mutations in the Hb β-chain gene, characterized by reduced or absent β-globin synthesis, ineffective erythropoiesis, and relative excess of α-chains.<sup>[<xref rid=""R1"" ref-type=""bibr"">1</xref>]</sup> The excess α-chains aggregate to form inclusions, compromising red cell membrane integrity and leading to hemolysis. Clinical manifestations include hemolytic anemia, hepatosplenomegaly, skeletal deformities, and in severe cases, life-threatening complications. Based on the severity of clinical symptoms, β-thalassemia is classified into severe thalassemia major (TM), thalassemia intermedia (TI), mild thalassemia, and carriers. Additionally, according to transfusion requirements, β-thalassemia is categorized as transfusion-dependent thalassemia (TDT) or non-TDT (NTDT).<sup>[<xref rid=""R2"" ref-type=""bibr"">2</xref>]</sup> TI is a type of NTDT, while TM is a type of TDT.<sup>[<xref rid=""R3"" ref-type=""bibr"">3</xref>]</sup> The primary treatment modalities for β-thalassemia include regular blood transfusions, iron chelation therapy, allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (AHSCT), gene therapy, and erythroid maturation agents.<sup>[<xref rid=""R4"" ref-type=""bibr"">4</xref>]</sup> Although AHSCT can be curative for patients under 14 years of age, it is applicable to <30% of patients and is associated with a 5% to 10% treatment-related mortality rate.<sup>[<xref rid=""R5"" ref-type=""bibr"">5</xref>]</sup> Moreover, the vast majority of TDT patients cannot receive AHSCT due to the limited availability of HLA-matched donors.<sup>[<xref rid=""R6"" ref-type=""bibr"">6</xref>]</sup> Gene therapy is considered a promising treatment approach; however, its long-term efficacy remains to be determined.<sup>[<xref rid=""R7"" ref-type=""bibr"">7</xref>]</sup> Therefore, there is an urgent need to develop effective and affordable treatments for TM or TDT patients. Currently, there are limited options for treatment using γ-gene inducers to initiate fetal γ-globin.<sup>[<xref rid=""R8"" ref-type=""bibr"">8</xref>]</sup> Hydroxyurea alone has been reported to have minimal effect on increasing Hb levels and is associated with adverse reactions such as bone marrow suppression.<sup>[<xref rid=""R9"" ref-type=""bibr"">9</xref>–<xref rid=""R11"" ref-type=""bibr"">11</xref>]</sup> Decitabine has also shown limited therapeutic effect in improving Hb levels in NTDT patients, with a maximum observed increase of only 0.938 g/dL.<sup>[<xref rid=""R12"" ref-type=""bibr"">12</xref>]</sup> In 2008, Aguilar-Lopez et al first reported a patient with severe TM who received thalidomide treatment at 100 mg/day. After 3 months, the patient’s Hb level increased from 4.6 to 7 g/dL.<sup>[<xref rid=""R13"" ref-type=""bibr"">13</xref>]</sup> In recent years, with the in-depth research on HbF inducers, thalidomide has been found to elevate Hb levels in β-thalassemia patients, improving tissue ischemia and hypoxia. As a recognized HbF inducer, thalidomide primarily promotes γ-globin gene expression and subsequent HbF synthesis by enhancing reactive oxygen species-mediated p38 MAPK signaling and histone H4 acetylation during erythropoiesis, thereby alleviating the imbalance between α and β globin chains.<sup>[<xref rid=""R14"" ref-type=""bibr"">14</xref>,<xref rid=""R15"" ref-type=""bibr"">15</xref>]</sup> Most of these studies<sup>[<xref rid=""R2"" ref-type=""bibr"">2</xref>,<xref rid=""R3"" ref-type=""bibr"">3</xref>,<xref rid=""R16"" ref-type=""bibr"">16</xref>–<xref rid=""R20"" ref-type=""bibr"">20</xref>]</sup> have focused on short-term efficacy, and the long-term efficacy and safety of thalidomide in transfusion-dependent TM and TI patients remain unclear. In this study, we evaluated the short-term and long-term efficacy of thalidomide in transfusion-dependent TM and TI patients.   β-Thalassemia stands as the most prevalent monogenic genetic disorder and the hemolytic disease with the most significant impact on human health. In Zhongshan city, Guangdong province, China, the prevalence of thalassemia is notably high, with 30.93% of the population carrying the thalassemia gene. Specifically, the detection rates for α-thalassemia and β-thalassemia are 20.29% and 10.64%, respectively.<sup>[<xref rid=""R21"" ref-type=""bibr"">21</xref>]</sup> Conventional treatment strategies primarily involve regular high-volume blood transfusions coupled with routine iron-chelating agents. However, these approaches face significant challenges: blood supply shortages often prevent patients from receiving adequate transfusions; long-term transfusions can lead to iron overload, resulting in heart and liver failure, severely compromising patients’ quality of life and safety<sup>[<xref rid=""R22"" ref-type=""bibr"">22</xref>,<xref rid=""R23"" ref-type=""bibr"">23</xref>]</sup>; The high cost of iron chelation therapy, combined with insufficient chelation efforts, can exacerbate iron overload, potentially leading to heart failure and mortality. While AHSCT can cure severe β-thalassemia, its widespread application is limited by the scarcity of HLA-matched donors and prohibitive costs. Consequently, there is an urgent need to explore alternative treatment strategies that reduce or eliminate transfusion dependence. Recent research has focused on reactivating γ-globin genes, which are normally deactivated after birth in β-thalassemia patients. This approach aims to increase HbF proportions, functionally compensating for β-globin deficiency and alleviating the imbalance between α- and β-chains, thereby improving anemia.<sup>[<xref rid=""R24"" ref-type=""bibr"">24</xref>]</sup> Our study demonstrated that thalidomide treatment effectively increased Hb levels in patients with TDT. We observed overall response rates of 72.0% and 94.7% after 1 and 6 months of treatment, respectively. Notably, 50% (21 cases) of patients achieved transfusion independence. Long-term follow-up revealed sustained MaR in Hb levels for 6 patients over 60 months and 18 patients over 48 months. Thalidomide, an immunomodulatory drug with anti-angiogenic properties, has been shown to induce γ-globin gene expression, increase HbF levels, and promote erythroid precursor cell proliferation.<sup>[<xref rid=""R20"" ref-type=""bibr"">20</xref>,<xref rid=""R25"" ref-type=""bibr"">25</xref>]</sup> Its continuous use can enhance RBC production, correct anemia, and reduce transfusion dependence in β-thalassemia patients. While the precise mechanism of thalidomide action remains incompletely understood, several pathways have been proposed: Thalidomide enhances the expression of GATA-1 and EKLF in erythroid progenitor cells, inducing γ-globin gene expression and reversing γ-globin silencing through transcriptional reprogramming<sup>[<xref rid=""R15"" ref-type=""bibr"">15</xref>,<xref rid=""R25"" ref-type=""bibr"">25</xref>–<xref rid=""R28"" ref-type=""bibr"">28</xref>]</sup>; Thalidomide induces γ-globin gene expression through reactive oxygen species-dependent activation of the p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling pathway and histone H4 acetylation, thereby increasing HbF synthesis.<sup>[<xref rid=""R14"" ref-type=""bibr"">14</xref>]</sup> We observed that increases in HbF levels from baseline of > 50% were predictive of thalidomide treatment efficacy, which is simiar with previous study.<sup>[<xref rid=""R29"" ref-type=""bibr"">29</xref>]</sup> Additionally, thalidomide prolonged RBC lifespan and alleviated hemolysis, as evidenced by reductions in total bilirubin, indirect bilirubin, and lactate dehydrogenase levels.<sup>[<xref rid=""R2"" ref-type=""bibr"">2</xref>]</sup> It is important to note that not all β-thalassemia patients respond uniformly to thalidomide, with some exhibiting secondary responses or no response.<sup>[<xref rid=""R20"" ref-type=""bibr"">20</xref>]</sup> In our cohort, 4 patients showed no response to thalidomide, possibly due to genetic polymorphisms or advanced age. Further investigation into these underlying mechanisms is warranted. Interestingly, 2 patients with homozygous β-thalassemia achieved transfusion independence when treated with hydroxyurea in combination with thalidomide. This finding merits further investigation with a larger cohort. Conversely, 2 patients experienced rapid decreases in Hb levels upon thalidomide discontinuation and failed to respond when treatment was resumed. This observation contradicts previous research,<sup>[<xref rid=""R30"" ref-type=""bibr"">30</xref>]</sup> and the underlying reasons remain unclear, necessitating further study. The adverse reactions associated with thalidomide are typically mild to moderate, with the most common side effects being somnolence, constipation, and rash. These effects are generally manageable through appropriate dose reduction or temporary discontinuation of treatment.<sup>[<xref rid=""R31"" ref-type=""bibr"">31</xref>]</sup> This aligns with our observations, as the side effects experienced in our study were not severe. It is noteworthy that 3 female patients in our cohort reported amenorrhea; however, the underlying mechanism remains unclear. Therefore, monitoring sex hormone levels during thalidomide treatment is essential, and the need for sex hormone replacement therapy warrants further investigation. Peripheral neurotoxicity is the primary dose-limiting toxicity associated with thalidomide. However, during our 5-year study, no patients exhibited peripheral neurotoxicity, extramedullary hematopoiesis, or venous thromboembolism. Nonetheless, close monitoring for these adverse effects will remain important in future treatments. In summary, thalidomide proves to be an effective treatment option for patients with β-thalassemia, significantly increasing Hb levels and reducing the necessity for transfusions. However, the findings of this study may be influenced by the relatively small sample size, indicating that future research should involve a larger cohort. Additionally, several questions remain unanswered: What is the optimal maintenance dose of thalidomide? What strategies can effectively mitigate complications arising from long-term use? What options are available for patients in whom thalidomide proves ineffective? Furthermore, could hydroxyurea or luspatercept be used in combination for synergistic treatment?<sup>[<xref rid=""R32"" ref-type=""bibr"">32</xref>,<xref rid=""R33"" ref-type=""bibr"">33</xref>]</sup> Addressing these questions will be crucial for advancing our understanding and management of β-thalassemia.

Adrenal Insufficiency in Patients with Beta Thalassemia: A Meta-Analysis,"<italic toggle=""yes"">Background and Objectives</italic>: Adrenal insufficiency (AI) can be a significant concern in patients with transfusion-dependent homozygous beta thalassemia (bThal) due to the chronic disease burden and frequent blood transfusions that these patients require. The prevalence of AI in this population remains unclear, with studies often lacking control groups for comparison. This meta-analysis aimed to estimate the proportion of patients with transfusion-dependent bThal who exhibit evidence of AI. <italic toggle=""yes"">Materials and Methods</italic>: A systematic review following PRISMA guidelines identified 19 studies for analysis. <italic toggle=""yes"">Results</italic>: Despite the variability in the diagnostic methods used to ascertain AI, the meta-analysis revealed that approximately one-third of patients had evidence of AI, with the prevalence rising to 50% in studies focused on adults with bThal. <italic toggle=""yes"">Conclusions</italic>: These findings suggest an increased risk of AI in patients with bThal compared to the general population. Clinicians should consider tailored management strategies, including glucocorticoid coverage during surgical procedures, to mitigate the risk of adrenal crises in this vulnerable patient group. Further research is needed to optimize adrenal surveillance and management in patients with bThal.","Homozygous beta thalassemia (bThal) can significantly impact endocrine function, primarily due to chronic iron overload resulting from regular blood transfusions. The inability of the body to excrete excess iron leads to iron accumulating in various organs, including endocrine glands such as the pituitary, thyroid, parathyroid, pancreas, and gonads. Iron deposition in these glands causes oxidative stress and cellular damage, disrupting hormone secretion and regulation. Chelation therapy is essential for managing iron overload and protecting endocrine organs, but the chelating agents themselves may influence endocrine function (this may result from the chelation of other essential trace elements like zinc when iron levels are low, the direct toxic effects of unchelated deferoxamine through interference with vital iron-dependent enzymes, or a combination of both factors) [<xref rid=""B1-medicina-60-01571"" ref-type=""bibr"">1</xref>]. The hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal (HPA) axis is a central component of the body’s neuroendocrine system, responsible for regulating stress responses, mood, immune function, and energy metabolism. The hypothalamus secretes corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) in response to stress. CRH stimulates the anterior pituitary gland to release adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), which then signals the adrenal cortex to produce and release glucocorticoids, primarily cortisol. Cortisol exerts widespread effects, including maintaining blood pressure, regulating glucose metabolism, and modulating the immune response. The HPA axis operates through a negative feedback loop, where elevated cortisol levels inhibit further CRH and ACTH release, thus maintaining hormonal balance and stress adaptation. Disruptions in the HPA axis can contribute to various clinical disorders, including adrenal insufficiency (AI) [<xref rid=""B2-medicina-60-01571"" ref-type=""bibr"">2</xref>]. Adrenal insufficiency (AI) is a potentially life-threatening condition characterized by inadequate production of glucocorticoids, mineralocorticoids, or both. The reported prevalence of AI in the general population is approximately 8–14 per 100,000 individuals (primary AI) and 15–28 per 100,000 individuals (secondary or central AI) [<xref rid=""B3-medicina-60-01571"" ref-type=""bibr"">3</xref>]. The prevalence of AI in patients with bThal remains unclear [<xref rid=""B4-medicina-60-01571"" ref-type=""bibr"">4</xref>,<xref rid=""B5-medicina-60-01571"" ref-type=""bibr"">5</xref>]. These patients receive multiple blood transfusions and iron chelation therapy, which may affect the HPA axis. Moreover, the methods used to diagnose AI in this population vary across studies, with some relying on baseline laboratory measurements, and others using dynamic testing. The association between adrenal dysfunction and transfusion-dependent anemias has generated interest among clinicians and researchers [<xref rid=""B6-medicina-60-01571"" ref-type=""bibr"">6</xref>]. However, most studies in this area lack appropriate control groups, hindering definitive assessments of prevalence and risk factors. This meta-analysis aimed to estimate the proportion of patients with bThal who exhibit evidence of AI, taking into consideration when the available studies were conducted, the age of the studied subjects, and the various diagnostic means to evaluate AI. A systematic literature review [PROSPERO registration No: CRD42024536719; [<uri http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink href=""https://www.crd.york.ac.uk/prospero/display_record.php?RecordID=536719"">https://www.crd.york.ac.uk/prospero/display_record.php?RecordID=536719</uri>, accessed on 21 September 2024] was conducted following PRISMA guidelines. PubMed and Scopus databases were searched using the strategy “human AND ((adrenal AND insufficiency) OR (adrenal AND failure)) AND (thalassemia AND (transfusion AND dependent AND anemia))”. Initially, 79 articles were identified from PubMed and 144 from Scopus. After screening and removal of works examining other forms of transfusion-dependent anemias or sickle cell anemias, works where the evaluation for adrenal insufficiency was conducted with baseline-only testing or undisclosed modalities, as well as duplicate publications, 19 articles were included for meta-analysis (see the PRISMA diagram—<xref rid=""medicina-60-01571-f001"" ref-type=""fig"">Figure 1</xref>) [<xref rid=""B6-medicina-60-01571"" ref-type=""bibr"">6</xref>,<xref rid=""B7-medicina-60-01571"" ref-type=""bibr"">7</xref>,<xref rid=""B8-medicina-60-01571"" ref-type=""bibr"">8</xref>,<xref rid=""B9-medicina-60-01571"" ref-type=""bibr"">9</xref>,<xref rid=""B10-medicina-60-01571"" ref-type=""bibr"">10</xref>,<xref rid=""B11-medicina-60-01571"" ref-type=""bibr"">11</xref>,<xref rid=""B12-medicina-60-01571"" ref-type=""bibr"">12</xref>,<xref rid=""B13-medicina-60-01571"" ref-type=""bibr"">13</xref>,<xref rid=""B14-medicina-60-01571"" ref-type=""bibr"">14</xref>,<xref rid=""B15-medicina-60-01571"" ref-type=""bibr"">15</xref>,<xref rid=""B16-medicina-60-01571"" ref-type=""bibr"">16</xref>,<xref rid=""B17-medicina-60-01571"" ref-type=""bibr"">17</xref>,<xref rid=""B18-medicina-60-01571"" ref-type=""bibr"">18</xref>,<xref rid=""B19-medicina-60-01571"" ref-type=""bibr"">19</xref>,<xref rid=""B20-medicina-60-01571"" ref-type=""bibr"">20</xref>,<xref rid=""B21-medicina-60-01571"" ref-type=""bibr"">21</xref>,<xref rid=""B22-medicina-60-01571"" ref-type=""bibr"">22</xref>,<xref rid=""B23-medicina-60-01571"" ref-type=""bibr"">23</xref>,<xref rid=""B24-medicina-60-01571"" ref-type=""bibr"">24</xref>,<xref rid=""B25-medicina-60-01571"" ref-type=""bibr"">25</xref>,<xref rid=""B26-medicina-60-01571"" ref-type=""bibr"">26</xref>,<xref rid=""B27-medicina-60-01571"" ref-type=""bibr"">27</xref>]. The quality of the articles was assessed with the University of Pennsylvania modified version of the Newcastle–Ottawa scale (NOS) (<uri http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink href=""https://www.med.upenn.edu/CEP/assets/user-content/documents/modified-newcastle-ottawa.pdf"">https://www.med.upenn.edu/CEP/assets/user-content/documents/modified-newcastle-ottawa.pdf</uri>, accessed on 21 September 2024) (<xref rid=""app1-medicina-60-01571"" ref-type=""app"">Supplemental Table S1</xref>); all the studies had a score of 4/10 (a major limitation being the absence of control subjects). Given the absence of control groups, a meta-analysis of proportions was performed. Analysis was performed for all the data combined according to AI testing modality, age of the included subjects, and year of publication. Six hundred and sixty-three subjects were included in the meta-analysis. Most studies were conducted in young persons < 24 y.o. and implemented dynamic testing with tetracosactrin (synthetic ACTH administration); few studies performed other dynamic tests (glucagon stimulation testing (GST) or insulin tolerance testing (ITT)) (<xref rid=""medicina-60-01571-t001"" ref-type=""table"">Table 1</xref>). Some studies that established their reported results with baseline-only testing orundisclosed/unspecified modalities were excluded from the analysis (see previous section). Some indication of bias was seen in funnel plots; heterogeneity indexes ranged from 6.70 to 136.86 (Q) and 25.48% to 94.55% (I2); and no heterogeneity was seen in studies focused only on adults (however, there were fewer than 10 such studies) (<xref rid=""medicina-60-01571-f002"" ref-type=""fig"">Figure 2</xref> and <xref rid=""app1-medicina-60-01571"" ref-type=""app"">Supplemental Figure S1</xref>). The meta-analysis of the 19 selected studies revealed that a substantial percentage of patients with transfusion-dependent bThal had evidence of AI, with the prevalence ranging from 0% to 80% across individual studies (<xref rid=""medicina-60-01571-f003"" ref-type=""fig"">Figure 3</xref> and <xref rid=""app1-medicina-60-01571"" ref-type=""app"">Supplemental Figure S2</xref>). Overall, one-quarter of all the subjects with bThal had AI (25.62%). Specifically, in subjects who were assessed with tetracosactrin (Synacthen; either low-dose [post1 μgtetracosactrini.v.] and/or high-dose [post250 μgtetracosactrini.v.]), AI was found in 27.25%, whereas the rate of AI was lower at 17.17% in subjects who were assessed with ITT. The highest rate of AI was noted in adults > 24 y.o. (51.5%) compared to those < 24 y.o. who had a rate of 20.34%. In studies conducted before the year 2000, the rate was low at 5.35%, in sharp contrast to those conducted after the year 2000, where the rate increased to 35.36%. AI in bThal results from iron deposition/secondary hemochromatosis in the adrenal cortex (primary AI) or the pituitary gland (secondary or central AI; the latter term usually also includes cases of hypothalamic causes of AI caused by lack of CRH production [<xref rid=""B28-medicina-60-01571"" ref-type=""bibr"">28</xref>]). In primary AI, iron accumulates directly in the adrenal glands, impairing cortisol production by damaging the adrenal cortex. This disrupts the body’s ability to respond to stress, including infections or physical exertion. Iron deposition in the hypothalamus or the pituitary gland can lead to secondary adrenal insufficiency by reducing ACTH secretion. Without adequate ACTH stimulation of any cause, the adrenal glands produce insufficient cortisol, further contributing to adrenal dysfunction. Patients with bThal and AI may experience few, if any, symptoms, which may be obscured by common symptoms of bThal such as fatigue, muscle weakness, or joint pain [<xref rid=""B29-medicina-60-01571"" ref-type=""bibr"">29</xref>]. Although there were a few studies in which patients with bThal were assessed for AI using basal cortisol levels, in our analysis, we used data from studies which assessed AI with dynamic tests (tetracosactrin, GST, or ITT); dynamic testing is considered able to label patients with AI more accurately [<xref rid=""B30-medicina-60-01571"" ref-type=""bibr"">30</xref>]. The tetracosactrin stimulation test involves the intravenous or intramuscular administration of a synthetic fragment of ACTH with full biological activity. Following that injection, serum cortisol levels are measured [<xref rid=""B31-medicina-60-01571"" ref-type=""bibr"">31</xref>] (sensitivity is reported to reach 85%, with specificity at 96% [<xref rid=""B32-medicina-60-01571"" ref-type=""bibr"">32</xref>]). In the GST, glucose levels temporarily increase and stimulate insulin secretion in subjects without diabetes. This insulin surge lowers glucose levels, triggering a counter-regulatory response, which includes an increase in cortisol [<xref rid=""B31-medicina-60-01571"" ref-type=""bibr"">31</xref>] (sensitivity is reported to reach 56%, with specificity at 83% [<xref rid=""B33-medicina-60-01571"" ref-type=""bibr"">33</xref>]). By administering an intravenous bolus of insulin to induce severe hypoglycemia, the ITT stimulates a counter-regulatory response that evaluates the entire HPA axis [<xref rid=""B32-medicina-60-01571"" ref-type=""bibr"">32</xref>] (sensitivity was recently reported to reach 100%, with specificity at 87% [<xref rid=""B30-medicina-60-01571"" ref-type=""bibr"">30</xref>]). The ITT is considered to be the gold standard for diagnosing all types of AI, especially those involving hypothalamic and pituitary dysfunction, where the tetracosactrin stimulation test might yield a false-negative result [<xref rid=""B34-medicina-60-01571"" ref-type=""bibr"">34</xref>]. The findings of this meta-analysis suggest that patients with bThal have a higher prevalence of AI compared to the general population. Nevertheless, we noted that fewer cases of AI were noted in studies that used ITT compared to those that used the tetracosactrin test. These differences may be attributed to differences in the diagnostic characteristics of the tests (please see above). Older individuals with bThal had higher rates of AI compared to younger ones. This may be the result of more accumulated years of transfusions, with concomitant iron deposition and subsequent effects on the HPA axis. Interestingly, older (pre-2000) studies practically did not report AI. We can speculate that this may be due to the shift in norms of transfusion therapy, as well as the fact that adrenal insufficiency may not have been as frequently suspected or checked, especially in patients with hemoglobinopathies. Over the years, the treatment paradigm for homozygous beta thalassemia has evolved towards more intensive transfusion and chelation therapy [<xref rid=""B35-medicina-60-01571"" ref-type=""bibr"">35</xref>,<xref rid=""B36-medicina-60-01571"" ref-type=""bibr"">36</xref>,<xref rid=""B37-medicina-60-01571"" ref-type=""bibr"">37</xref>,<xref rid=""B38-medicina-60-01571"" ref-type=""bibr"">38</xref>,<xref rid=""B39-medicina-60-01571"" ref-type=""bibr"">39</xref>,<xref rid=""B40-medicina-60-01571"" ref-type=""bibr"">40</xref>]. This approach aims to maintain hemoglobin levels within a certain range to prevent complications such as growth retardation, organ damage, and bone deformities. However, more frequent transfusions can lead to iron overload and secondary hemochromatosis, which in its turn necessitates more aggressive chelation therapy to remove excess iron from the body. Side effects of intensive transfusion and chelation can include iron overload-related complications such as hepatic damage, cardiac problems, and endocrine dysfunction. Secondary hemochromatosis could affect and compromise all levels of the HPA axis. Balancing the benefits and risks of transfusions and chelation therapy is crucial in managing homozygous beta thalassemia effectively. The limitations of the present study include the relatively small number of studies which were fit to be considered for inclusion, totaling a relatively small number of patients. Moreover, a few studies (or parts of them) were unfortunately left out of the analysis; in two of them, no details on the assessment/exclusion of AI were given [<xref rid=""B25-medicina-60-01571"" ref-type=""bibr"">25</xref>,<xref rid=""B26-medicina-60-01571"" ref-type=""bibr"">26</xref>], while in another (older) one, the authors reported that no cases of AI were found, using, however, only basal plasma cortisol measurements. In the latter study, the results were detailed graphically, and careful evaluation of the relevant figure shows almost all the basal cortisol measurements to be in the “grey” zone between 100 nmol/L and 400 nmol/L [<xref rid=""B24-medicina-60-01571"" ref-type=""bibr"">24</xref>]. Additionally, we should point out the heightened heterogeneity of the results. Nevertheless, we believe that this does not invalidate our findings, since it is apparent that in studies after the year 2000, the results point unanimously to the direction of AI in approximately 30% of patients with bThal, with an increasing trend with advancing age, a finding that reflects the burden of repeated transfusions on the functionality of the HPA axis. Current guidelines recommend assessment of the HPA axis’ integrity every 1–2 years in patients with bThalwho are being treated for growth hormone deficiency (since there is potential for concomitant anterior pituitary hormone deficiencies) [<xref rid=""B41-medicina-60-01571"" ref-type=""bibr"">41</xref>]. In light of our findings, it may be prudent to consider glucocorticoid coverage in all patients with bThal who are undergoing surgical procedures, such as gall bladder surgery or splenectomy, to prevent potential adrenal crises. However, further research is needed to confirm these findings, to differentiate primary versus secondary AI, and to establish optimal strategies for the screening and management of AI in this patient population. In conclusion, this meta-analysis underscores the higher prevalence of adrenal insufficiency among patients with bThal. The observed diagnostic variability emphasizes the need for standardized criteria for AI diagnosis in this patient cohort. Clinicians should be aware of the increased risk of AI in these patients and consider tailored management strategies to optimize patient care and outcomes. Future research should focus on elucidating the underlying mechanisms and refining diagnostic approaches for adrenal dysfunction in transfusion-dependent anemias.",N/A,25 9 2024
"Health-Related Quality of Life of Adolescents With Non-transfusion-Dependent Thalassemia in Basrah, Iraq","Background: Thalassemia is a chronic inherited disease with the potential for serious clinical and psychological effects. In the case of thalassemia, a cure is not currently accessible, and lifelong treatment is required. Health-related quality of life (HRQoL) is considered a crucial health outcome. Objectives: This study aims to assess the HRQoL of children and adolescents with non-transfusion-dependent thalassemia (NTDT) and compare it with that of beta-thalassemia major (β-TM) and healthy subjects. Patients and methods: This case-control study included 88 patients with NTDT and 153 age- and gender-matched healthy children and adolescents. In addition, we included 70 registered patients with β-TM. We used the short-form health survey questionnaire to assess HRQoL. Results: Of the 88 patients, 41 were diagnosed with alpha-thalassemia intermedia (α-TI; hemoglobin H disease), and 47 were with beta-thalassemia intermedia (β-TI). HRQoL domains were significantly higher in healthy children and adolescents compared to NTDT patients (P<0.001); the role emotion domain was the most affected in NTDT patients (51.92 ± 3.37), followed by general health (52.72 ± 3.05) and role physical (53.59 ± 3.13). α-TI patients had significantly higher HRQoL domains than patients with β-TI. The study also indicated that NTDT patients had significantly better QoL scores compared to β-TM patients (P<0.001) across all domains. Conclusions: NTDT patients have a lower HRQoL compared to healthy controls. However, their HRQoL scores are significantly better than those of patients with β-TM. Among NTDT patients, those with α-TI have significantly better HRQoL scores compared to patients with β-TI.","Non-transfusion-dependent thalassemia (NTDT) is a group of thalassemia disorders that include patients who do not require regular blood transfusions for survival. The most common types are beta-thalassemia intermedia (β-TI), hemoglobin E/β-thalassemia, and alpha-thalassemia intermedia (α-TI; hemoglobin H (HbH) disease) [<xref rid=""REF1"" ref-type=""bibr"">1</xref>]. Patients with NTDT experience numerous clinical complications despite their independence from frequent transfusions. Morbidities in NTDT stem from the interaction of various pathophysiological factors: ineffective erythropoiesis, iron overload (IOL), and hypercoagulability [<xref rid=""REF2"" ref-type=""bibr"">2</xref>]. The evaluation of quality of life (QoL) differs from other medical assessments as it centers on individuals’ perspectives of their health and appraises additional aspects of life, thereby providing a more comprehensive view of well-being [<xref rid=""REF3"" ref-type=""bibr"">3</xref>]. Patients with NTDT may develop significant complications related to their disease, primarily IOL, and challenges in adhering to iron chelation therapy (ICT), which negatively affects their QoL [<xref rid=""REF4"" ref-type=""bibr"">4</xref>]. Moreover, a significant percentage of patients with NTDT encounter severe cardiovascular, endocrine, hepatic, or skeletal complications [<xref rid=""REF5"" ref-type=""bibr"">5</xref>]. Patients with NTDT present at the end of the clinical spectrum between the ages of two and six years but typically come to medical attention and are diagnosed in late childhood or during adolescence. This period can be a challenging time for them to adjust to their disease, as adolescence itself is a difficult phase. The presence of an illness may further lower their chance for psychosocial adaptation to the disease, decrease their understanding of it, or result in fewer interactions with comprehensive care centers and staff. These factors may harm their QoL [<xref rid=""REF6"" ref-type=""bibr"">6</xref>,<xref rid=""REF7"" ref-type=""bibr"">7</xref>]. The term “health-related quality of life (HRQoL)” is extensively employed in assessing the QoL in general and specifically in patients with chronic diseases. The 36-Item Short Form Survey version 2 (SF-36 v2) questionnaire is recommended as the standard instrument for assessing HRQoL in thalassemia, as the majority of the questionnaire’s subscales appear to be affected by complications from the disease and ICT [<xref rid=""REF8"" ref-type=""bibr"">8</xref>]. This study evaluated the HRQoL in children and adolescents with NTDT. The objective was to compare it with those who are healthy and those with beta-thalassemia major (β-TM) within the same age group. This case-control study included patients with NTDT registered at the Centre for Hereditary Blood Diseases (CHBD) in Basrah. A total of 88 patients with NTDT, aged 12-18 years, were recruited over seven months, from December 2017 through June 2018. Those who were deaf-mute and who refused to do or complete the interview were excluded from the study. The Scientific and Ethical Committee of the College of Medicine, University of Basrah approved the study (approval number: 7/35/716, date: February 13, 2020). The data included socio-demographic variables as well as disease-related variables such as age at diagnosis, age at the first transfusion (if applicable), the number of clinic visits, hospital admissions, blood transfusions in the previous year, and a history of splenectomy. The patients and their caregivers were interviewed, and medical records were reviewed for disease-related complications (e.g., diabetes mellitus, bone disease, heart failure, growth retardation, delayed puberty, gall bladder diseases, and stroke), the use of ICT (type and duration), and the use of hydroxyurea. The family income was categorized based on the average monthly per capita in Iraqi Dinars (ID) as follows: low (<100,000 ID/month), medium (100,000-250,000 ID/month), and high (>250,000 ID/month) [<xref rid=""REF9"" ref-type=""bibr"">9</xref>]. A total of 88 patients (34 males and 54 females) with NTDT were enrolled in this study. All of them were identified as having either β-TI or α-TI (HbH disease) based on clinical and laboratory findings [<xref rid=""REF1"" ref-type=""bibr"">1</xref>,<xref rid=""REF10"" ref-type=""bibr"">10</xref>]. Forty-seven patients were categorized with β-TI, and 41 patients presented with HbH disease. The NTDT patients were categorized based on their status of blood transfusion as follows: never transfused, occasional blood transfusion (patients who require incidental blood transfusion due to transient severe anemia), and regular blood transfusion (once every one to three months) [<xref rid=""REF11"" ref-type=""bibr"">11</xref>]. In addition to NTDT patients, 70 patients with β-TM of comparable age and gender who were registered at CHBD and consulted the center for routine follow-up and/or blood transfusion were also recruited during the study period. Verbal consent was obtained from children and adolescents, and/or their caregivers, for the completion of the data and the SF-36 v2 questionnaire. For the NTDT and β-TM patients, data was collected through direct interviews with the NTDT patients and one of their parents who had consulted the CHBD for routine follow-ups and/or blood transfusions. Blood transfusion requirements vary between different groups, namely NTDT and β-TM, and are categorized as follows: none, occasional (1-5 times/year), low (6-12 times/year), and high (13-22 times/year) [<xref rid=""REF12"" ref-type=""bibr"">12</xref>]. The control group comprised 153 age- and gender-matched children and adolescents with no history of any chronic conditions, including hemoglobinopathies, or health-related conditions four weeks before the submission of required responses for the study [<xref rid=""REF13"" ref-type=""bibr"">13</xref>]. Data were collected from the control group through visits to six primary and secondary schools in various districts of Basrah. Before their recruitment into the study, informed verbal consent was obtained from the children, school managers, and teachers. HRQoL (SF-36 v2) questionnaire This type of questionnaire, a well-recognized, generic short-form health survey with 36 questions, can be self-administered or given by a trained interviewer. This survey measures the functional status, well-being, and overall evaluation of health from the patient’s perspective, with SF-36 v2 items acting as multiple operational indicators of health, including behavioral function and dysfunction, distress, and well-being [<xref rid=""REF14"" ref-type=""bibr"">14</xref>]. These SF-36 v2 items are used to score eight dimensions, specifically physical functioning (PF), role physical (RF), bodily pain (BP), general health (GH), vitality (VT), social functioning (SF), role emotion (RE), and mental health (MH). These dimensions form the physical component summary and the mental component summary [<xref rid=""REF13"" ref-type=""bibr"">13</xref>]. The median reliability coefficients for each of the eight scales are ≥0.08, except for SF, which has a median reliability across studies of 0.76. The questionnaire’s validity rests between 80% and 90%. An evaluation of the cross-cultural adaptations of this instrument indicated moderate to good quality [<xref rid=""REF13"" ref-type=""bibr"">13</xref>]. The Arabic version of SF-36 v2 was utilized. The median Cronbach’s alpha for the Arabic RAND-36 exceeded 0.07 in most scales across multiple subgroups [<xref rid=""REF15"" ref-type=""bibr"">15</xref>,<xref rid=""REF16"" ref-type=""bibr"">16</xref>]. The scoring of this questionnaire translates an individual’s responses to a standard 0-100 scale. In the SF-36 v2 questionnaire, higher scores signify a better QoL, while lower scores indicate poor health and QoL. Statistical analysis Data was processed and analyzed using SPSS Statistics version 23 (IBM Corp. Released 2015. IBM SPSS Statistics for Windows, Version 23.0. Armonk, NY: IBM Corp.). Comparisons of proportions were carried out using the Chi-square test for cross-tabulation, provided each cell had an expected frequency of 5 or more. Fisher’s exact test was applied when one or more cells had an expected frequency of less than 5. The independent sample t-test was used for the quantitative comparison between the means of two different samples. ANOVA was employed to assess the significance of the differences between the means of three samples. Multiple linear regression analysis was employed to evaluate the correlation between the SF-36 v2 scores of NTDT patients and the various studied socio-demographic and clinical variables, as well as disease-related complications. A P-value of <0.05 was considered statistically significant for all statistical tests. Socio-demographic characteristics of patients with NTDT and healthy controls A total of 153 healthy children and adolescents were evaluated. The mean age for NTDT patients was 14.07 ± 1.95, while the mean age for the healthy control group was 14.46 ± 2.05. NTDT patients exhibited a significantly lower educational level, lower parental education, and lower family income (P<0.001) (Table <xref rid=""TAB1"" ref-type=""table"">1</xref>). Characteristics of NTDT patients Of the 88 patients with NTDT, 46.59% had α-TI (HbH disease), and 53.41% had β-TI. The study did not reveal a significant difference between α-TI and β-TI in terms of age, gender, maternal educational level, and family income (P>0.05) (Table <xref rid=""TAB2"" ref-type=""table"">2</xref>). The educational levels of patients and their fathers significantly differed concerning disease type; specifically, the percentage of those who did not attend school was significantly higher, and those who attended secondary school were lower in β-TI compared to HbH disease patients. We found a significantly higher number of β-TI patients who were on ICT and HU and required more blood than those with α-TI (P<0.001). Furthermore, the frequency of complications was significantly higher among β-TI patients (P<0.05). Among patients with HbH disease, 82.93% experienced no complications. This is in contrast to the 53.20% of β-TI patients who also had no complications. The most common complications among β-TI patients were cardiac complications, observed in eight patients (17.02%), followed by growth retardation in four patients (8.51%). Stroke and osteoporosis complications were each observed in three patients (6.38%). In patients with α-TI, the most common complications included osteoporosis in three (7.31%) cases, followed by all immunization and cardiac disease, with two (4.87%) cases each. Socio-demographic and clinical characteristics of patients with NTDT and β-TM The study also included 70 patients with β-TM. There was no significant difference in all the studied variables between both groups, except for the age groups. The number of NTDT patients aged 12-15 years old was significantly higher (P<0.05). However, there was no significant difference among males and females of different age groups (P>0.05) (Table <xref rid=""TAB3"" ref-type=""table"">3</xref>). The study reported a statistically significant difference in the age of diagnosis and frequency of blood transfusion between patients with NTDT and β-TM (P<0.05). Concerning disease-related complications, patients with β-TM have a significantly higher frequency of complications compared to NTDT patients, mainly cardiac complications (32.46%) and growth retardation (15.71%). HRQoL domains among different studied groups Patients with NTDT have significantly lower scores in all HRQoL domains compared to the control group. However, when compared to β-TM, NTDT patients had high scores and scored higher in all HRQoL domains (P<0.001) (Table <xref rid=""TAB4"" ref-type=""table"">4</xref>). Patients with HbH disease generally have a better HRQoL across all domains as compared to β-TI, with the exception being the SF domain. The study also demonstrated a significant negative correlation between the frequency of blood transfusion and all domains. Additionally, there was a significant negative correlation between patient age and the GH and MHCS domains. A significant positive association was found between per capita income and most of the SF-36 v2 scores, except for PF and VT, which were not impacted by family income (Table <xref rid=""TAB5"" ref-type=""table"">5</xref>). It was also observed that BP did not have any association with any of the studied variables. NTDT encompasses a variety of phenotypes. Unlike patients with β-TM, those with NTDT do not require regular blood transfusions to live. The most common forms are β-TI, HbE/β-thalassemia, and α-TI (HbH disease) [<xref rid=""REF1"" ref-type=""bibr"">1</xref>]. The effects of NTDT and TDT, along with their associated complications on HRQoL, remain largely unknown. The degree to which health is impaired, as perceived by the patients, is a crucial piece of information that needs to be highlighted to provide appropriate therapy [<xref rid=""REF7"" ref-type=""bibr"">7</xref>]. This study reveals that HRQoL in NTDT patients was lower than that in healthy children and adolescents across all SF-36 v2 domains. This result aligns with the findings reported by Safizadeh et al. in Kerman, Iran, demonstrating that NTDT patients have moderate scores compared to healthy Iranian individuals. However, it should be noted that the mean age of their patients was 22.95 ± 4.82 years [<xref rid=""REF17"" ref-type=""bibr"">17</xref>]. Such differences in QoL are to be expected, given the unique physical conditions and disease-related issues that thalassemia patients face [<xref rid=""REF18"" ref-type=""bibr"">18</xref>]. Patients with NTDT were observed to have better HRQoL than β-TM patients in all SF-36 v2 scores, with the lowest score reported for RE. Next was GH and then RP. Patients with β-TM also reported the lowest scores for GH, RE, and RP alike. Potential causes may include chronic anemia and/or IOL. Chronic anemia can lead to extramedullary hematopoiesis (EMH) and facial changes, which subsequently result in lower self-esteem and heightened fatigability. This makes them more inclined to shun social and physical activity [<xref rid=""REF18"" ref-type=""bibr"">18</xref>]. The RE domain is affected, as patients with thalassemia often feel a sense of otherness when compared to their peers. These patients may develop negative beliefs about their lives, occasionally experiencing feelings of sadness, anger, and hurt toward their illness. Furthermore, the treatment they undergo, which includes blood transfusions, recurrent invasive procedures, and hospital visits, can have adverse effects on their emotional and physical well-being [<xref rid=""REF19"" ref-type=""bibr"">19</xref>]. A prior study in Basra reported that 48.2% of TI children exhibit growth retardation and 11.8% show signs of EMH, both of which can affect self-esteem and, subsequently, physical activity [<xref rid=""REF20"" ref-type=""bibr"">20</xref>]. The superior HRQoL scores for NTDT patients may be due to them experiencing fewer disease-related complications, infrequent blood transfusions, and less need for ICT than β-TM patients, particularly those with HbH disease [<xref rid=""REF21"" ref-type=""bibr"">21</xref>]. These superior HRQoL scores for NTDT patients when compared with β-TM patients are consistent with findings by Mikael and Al-Allawi in Kurdistan, Iraq [<xref rid=""REF22"" ref-type=""bibr"">22</xref>]. However, these results are at odds with a study by Musallam et al. in Lebanon that assessed the HRQoL of 32 β-TI and 48 β-TM patients using the SF-36 v2. They found adult patients with β-TI had lower HRQoL than β-TM patients. They reasoned that β-TM patients had a longer time, thus a greater opportunity to adapt to the disease, its complications, and treatments. They also posited that despite both thalassemia types being managed at the same center, the β-TM patients, more frequently present, would become more familiar with the medical staff, form stronger bonds with each other and the healthcare staff, and consequently acquire more knowledge about the disease, its complications, and better adapt to the nature of the disease [<xref rid=""REF23"" ref-type=""bibr"">23</xref>]. A different study by Cappellini et al. noted that NTDT patients had significantly lower scores in GH, vitality, and mental component scores, without significant differences in other domains [<xref rid=""REF24"" ref-type=""bibr"">24</xref>]. Additionally, the healthcare system has been giving significant attention to β-TM, even though this focus has gradually started shifting towards β-TI and its severity [<xref rid=""REF25"" ref-type=""bibr"">25</xref>]. Patients with β-TI tend to have lower HRQoL scores in all domains compared to those with HbH disease. This discrepancy can be largely attributed to the higher frequency of complications in β-TI patients [<xref rid=""REF26"" ref-type=""bibr"">26</xref>,<xref rid=""REF27"" ref-type=""bibr"">27</xref>]. Many factors have been identified as predictors of HRQoL among NTDT patients in the current study. NTDT patients from low-income families have significantly lower scores in most HRQoL domains. Amid et al. reported that QoL is more affected in children suffering from thalassemia in low- and middle-income countries, suggesting that efforts to improve healthcare in these countries could enhance patients’ QoL [<xref rid=""REF28"" ref-type=""bibr"">28</xref>]. The frequency of blood transfusions was negatively associated with HRQoL. This finding is similar to that reported by Mikael and Al-Allawi in Kurdistan, Iraq [<xref rid=""REF22"" ref-type=""bibr"">22</xref>]. Age was another predictor of the QoL for NTDT patients. This correlation can be attributed to the increased frequency of complications with age and the transition to adolescence and puberty [<xref rid=""REF1"" ref-type=""bibr"">1</xref>]. Limitations of the study One limitation is that this study was cross-sectional. A longitudinal study is necessary to evaluate the HRQoL for each patient during the various stages and throughout the progression of the disease. Although pediatric patients with NTDT were found to have lower HRQoL scores than healthy adolescents, their QoL was superior to that of the patients with β-TM. Moreover, patients with HbH disease displayed a better HRQoL than those with β-TI patients. The frequency of blood transfusions and age were factors that had a negative association with HRQoL domains in NTDT patients. Additionally, family income was seen to negatively impact HRQoL. As such, integrating the HRQoL assessment using a standardized instrument in the care of NTDT patients can help to pinpoint the areas where patients’ functions are impaired. This can assist in making timely interventions and further improve their QoL. A longitudinal study is recommended to assess the HRQoL for each patient during the different stages and along the course of the disease.",N/A,25 9 2024
Exploring alterations of gut/blood microbes in addressing iron overload-induced gut dysbiosis and cognitive impairment in thalassemia patients,"Iron overload causes cognitive impairment in thalassemia patients. The gut-brain axis plays an important role in cognitive function. However, the association between gut/blood microbiome, cognition, and iron burden in thalassemia patients has not been thoroughly investigated. We aimed to determine those associations in thalassemia patients with different blood-transfusion regimens. Sixty participants: healthy controls, transfusion-dependent thalassemia (TDT) patients, and non-transfusion-dependent (NTDT) patients, were recruited to evaluate iron overload, cognition, and gut/blood microbiome. TDT patients exhibited greater iron overload than NTDT patients. Most thalassemia patients developed gut dysbiosis, and approximately 25% of the patients developed minor cognitive impairment. Increased Fusobacteriota and Verrucomicrobiota with decreased Fibrobacterota were observed in both TDT and NTDT groups. TDT patients showed more abundant beneficial bacteria: Verrucomicrobia. Iron overload was correlated with cognitive impairment. Increased <italic toggle=""yes"">Butyricimonas</italic> and decreased <italic toggle=""yes"">Paraclostridium</italic> were associated with higher cognitive function. No trace of blood microbiota was observed. Differences in blood bacterial profiles of thalassemia patients and controls were insignificant. These findings suggest iron overload plays a role in the imbalance of gut microbiota and impaired cognitive function in thalassemia patients. Harnessing probiotic potential from those microbes could prevent the gut-brain disturbance in thalassemia patients.","Thalassemia is a hereditary hemoglobinopathy characterized by impaired α-globin in alpha-thalassemia and impaired β-globin in beta-thalassemia, leading to dysfunctional red blood cells (RBC) and severe anemia<sup><xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR1"">1</xref>,<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR2"">2</xref></sup>. Over the decades, although the implementation of iron chelators has prevented life-threatening cardiomyopathy due to iron overload<sup><xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR3"">3</xref></sup>, the longer life expectancy of patients has extended the spectrum of iron overload complications, one of which is cognitive impairment<sup><xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR4"">4</xref></sup>. Our previous study along with existing literature has shown that thalassemia patients developed cognitive impairment due to iron overload<sup><xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR5"">5</xref>–<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR7"">7</xref></sup>. Although long-term blood transfusion has been recognized as a cause of cognitive impairment<sup><xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR8"">8</xref></sup>, the association between iron overload in thalassemia patients with different blood-transfusion regimens, including transfusion-dependent thalassemia (TDT) and non-TDT (NTDT), and cognitive impairment is still unclear. Not only did rats with iron overload experience cognitive impairment<sup><xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR9"">9</xref></sup>, but beta-thalassemia mice also exhibited changes in gut microbiota or “gut dysbiosis”<sup><xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR10"">10</xref></sup>, raising the possibility of an association between iron overload and gut dysbiosis in the pathogenesis of cognitive impairment. In human, evidence regarding the role of gut dysbiosis in cognitive decline among thalassemia patients is still unclear. One of the potential mechanisms underlying the gut-brain axis is the disruption of the gut and blood brain barriers following systemic oxidative stress caused by iron overload<sup><xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR9"">9</xref>,<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR11"">11</xref></sup>. Following this disruption, the circulation transports both beneficial and detrimental gut microbial components and their metabolites from the gut to the brain<sup><xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR10"">10</xref></sup>. Additionally, Tan et al. (2023) confirmed the existence of blood bacteria in healthy individuals as well as a rise in blood bacteriome – a community of blood bacteria – were observed in different pathological conditions, but the characteristics of blood bacterial profiles in thalassemia patients are still unknown<sup><xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR12"">12</xref>,<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR13"">13</xref></sup>. Altogether, the associations between the gut and blood microbiome, cognition, and iron overload in thalassemia patients with varying blood-transfusion levels have not been thoroughly investigated. Additionally, short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), beneficial gut-microbiota derived metabolites, were found as an essential protective factors for cognitive impairment<sup><xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR14"">14</xref></sup>. However, evidence supporting whether SCFAs alter due to gut dysbiosis in thalassemia remains unexplored. Therefore, this study aimed to explore the interrelationships between iron overload, changes in the gut/blood microbiome, potential alterations in their SCFAs, and cognitive impairment in TDT and NTDT patients.  We found that, compared to healthy controls, thalassemia patients exhibited systemic iron overload together with gut dysbiosis. Notably, the severity of iron overload determined the level of cognitive impairment in thalassemia patients. Interrelationships among gut microbial taxa with clinical and biochemical parameters were identified. However, no differences were observed in blood bacterial profiles between thalassemia patients and healthy controls. Evidence of gut dysbiosis in the context of thalassemia, both in humans and animal models, has been scant, with a focus on beta-thalassemia major. Studies conducted in Th3/+ C57BL/6J mice (beta-thalassemia) confirmed that iron overload contributes to gut dysbiosis<sup><xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR10"">10</xref>,<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR11"">11</xref>,<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR15"">15</xref>,<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR16"">16</xref></sup>. However, dysbiotic profiles among studies varied, possibly due to differences in the age group, dietary composition, and interventions such as doses of iron supplements and chelators. Aside from animal studies, to the best of our knowledge, this is the first study delineating gut dysbiosis in adult thalassemia patients, although a few clinical observations have been conducted in pediatric patients<sup><xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR17"">17</xref>,<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR18"">18</xref></sup>. Similar to our taxonomic profiles, the gut microbiota of thalassemia children were also predominated by the family <italic toggle=""yes"">Lachnospiraceae</italic>, especially <italic toggle=""yes"">Blautia</italic><sup><xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR17"">17</xref></sup>. Both the family and genus are recognized as one of the main producers of SCFAs in the gut<sup><xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR19"">19</xref>,<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR20"">20</xref></sup>. Yet, a decrease in <italic toggle=""yes"">Fibrobacter</italic> (phylum Fibrobacterota), an SCFA producer, was observed in our thalassemia cohort<sup><xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR21"">21</xref></sup>. Interestingly, <italic toggle=""yes"">Akkermansia</italic> (phylum Verrucomicrobiota), which enhances other gut fermenters to produce SCFAs, was extensively increased in our thalassemia patients, especially those in the TDT group<sup><xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR22"">22</xref></sup>. This finding resembles the findings of Visitchanakun et al. (2020 and 2021) which showed that Verrucomicrobiota was increased in beta-thalassemia mice with iron supplementation<sup><xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR11"">11</xref>,<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR16"">16</xref></sup>. On the other hand, Siwichaiin et al. (2022) demonstrated that deferiprone beneficially increased levels of this phylum in beta-thalassemia mice<sup><xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR10"">10</xref></sup>. Of note, most of our thalassemia patients were currently treated with iron chelators, particularly those with TDT. Whether the rise in this phylum in our thalassemia patients is compensatory or influenced by xenobiotics from iron chelators is still speculatory and worth mechanistic exploration. Collectively, these changes could explain why levels of SCFAs in thalassemia patients with iron overload did not significantly decline. In contrast to the beneficial Verrucomicrobiota, increased abundance of <italic toggle=""yes"">Fusobacteriaceae</italic> (phylum Fusobacteriota) possibly represents a pathologic change in thalassemia patients. Colonization by <italic toggle=""yes"">Fusobacterium nucleatum</italic> has been widely accepted in driving gut dysbiosis<sup><xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR23"">23</xref></sup>. Under iron-rich intervention, macrophages co-cultured with <italic toggle=""yes"">Fusobacterium nucleatum</italic> express various inflammatory mediators, exemplified by CCL8, a neutrophil-recruiting chemokine<sup><xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR24"">24</xref></sup>. Accordingly, it is postulated that <italic toggle=""yes"">Fusobacteriaceae</italic> may serve as a pathobiont in thalassemia. Apart from the taxa mentioned, whether a reduction in commensal Spirochaetota in thalassemia patients has a negative effect on gut communities necessitates further investigation, as most studies have focused on pathogenic strains instead of spirochete flora<sup><xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR25"">25</xref></sup>. Furthermore, in terms of metagenome function, fucose utilization is an essential process for gut microbes to establish symbiotic gut microbiota<sup><xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR26"">26</xref></sup>. A predicted decrease in fucose degradation in the gut microbiota of thalassemia patients corroborates the gut dysbiosis in these patients. Together, our findings imply that gut dysbiosis in thalassemia encompasses complex microbial relationships in terms of both composition and corresponding functions. Iron accumulation in brain cortices as an aging process contributes to cognitive impairment in the elderly<sup><xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR27"">27</xref>,<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR28"">28</xref></sup>. This excess iron potentiates oxidative stress, causing neuronal ferroptosis in both aging population and thalassemia patients<sup><xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR29"">29</xref>,<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR30"">30</xref></sup>. According to our previous study, we applied the MoCA assessment to evaluate cognitive decline in a thalassemia population with a mean age of 35 ± 11years<sup><xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR5"">5</xref></sup>, which is relatively similar to mean age of our current study. Moreover, this assessment has been validated to detect early MCI in Turkish migrants in Germany with a mean age of 42.3 ± 11.9 years<sup><xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR31"">31</xref></sup>. In addition to the MoCA assessment, the MSET10 test was also applied to replicate the downward trend observed with another assessment. In our study, where thalassemia patients have been afflicted with life-long iron overload, albeit properly treated with iron chelators, cognitive impairment at an early age becomes an unavoidable complication of the disease. Although our findings highlight that increased ferritin levels were associated with a greater severity of cognitive impairment, the proportion of patients with MCI in the current cohort (approximately 25%) was lower than that in our previous study (approximately 70%)<sup><xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR5"">5</xref></sup>. One possible explanation is the age disparity between the thalassemia cohorts<sup><xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR5"">5</xref></sup>. While MCI in older patients was related to the record of maximal five-year ferritin levels, our younger thalassemia cohort represented a very early level of cognitive decline indicated by their correlation with current ferritin levels instead<sup><xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR5"">5</xref></sup>. In addition, while increasing age contributed to a decline in cognitive function in several studies, the age range of our thalassemia patients within the current cohort were 20–40 years old, which were in adulthood period, not in elderly period. Furthermore, our data showed that the oldest TDT patient was 40 years old with a normal MoCA score of 27, whereas the second oldest TDT patient was 38 years old with a MoCA score of 20. These findings suggest that disease-driven factors, aside from age, may be underlying the cognitive impairment in our study. These findings led us to focus the pathology of thalassemia by examining serum ferritin levels. To understand the relationships between age, level of iron overload and cognitive function in Thalassemia patients, some important questions need to be answered, including (1) whether cognitive function fluctuates in parallel with the status of iron overload across various age strata, and (2) whether there is a point of no return for serum ferritin levels beyond which cognitive function will progressively impair, regardless of age. Therefore, further studies are still required to investigate in both questions. In terms of the gut microbiota, although there were no obvious differences in the gut microbe composition between the patients with and without MCI, initial findings support the existence of evidence regarding the gut-brain axis. For example, <italic toggle=""yes"">Butyricimonas</italic>, a producer of butyric acid, was a protective factor against cognitive impairment<sup><xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR32"">32</xref>,<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR33"">33</xref></sup>. Our findings support this role of <italic toggle=""yes"">Butyricimonas</italic> by showing that subjects with higher MSET10 scores tended to have a greater abundance of this genus. Furthermore, increased <italic toggle=""yes"">Paraclostridium</italic>, a mucin degrader, was considered as a risk factor due to an association with lower MoCA scores in our cohort. Some reports have indicated that <italic toggle=""yes"">Paraclostridium bifermentans</italic> is capable of causing a brain abscess<sup><xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR34"">34</xref></sup>. However, to date there is no evidence linking this genus to cognitive function. Given that iron is a vital element for the metabolism of bacteria, it has been hypothesized that a sequential rise in blood bacteria as a consequence of iron overload exploitation is associated with the pathogenesis of various chronic inflammatory diseases<sup><xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR13"">13</xref>,<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR35"">35</xref></sup>. In the case of thalassemia, gut barrier disruption with translocation of microbial components into the circulation of patients has been observed<sup><xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR11"">11</xref>,<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR36"">36</xref></sup>. Although our thalassemia patients exhibited iron overload, blood bacterial profiles between the patients and healthy controls did not differ in terms of the disease, regularity of blood transfusion, or cognitive status of the patients. These findings imply that there were no blood microbiome in our case. Interestingly, most subjects in our study shared the characteristic that <italic toggle=""yes"">Corynebacterium</italic>, a commensal of oral and skin microbiota, had markedly higher blood read counts than gut read counts<sup><xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR37"">37</xref></sup>. Similar to Tan et al. (2023), blood bacteria tend to derive from the oral microbiota instead of the gut microbiota in the healthy population<sup><xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR12"">12</xref></sup>. Our findings imply that, despite gut dysbiosis, the integrity of gut barriers in thalassemia patients are intact enough to prevent the translocation of gut bacteria. Given that measuring serum ferritin levels has been implemented to evaluate status of iron overload in thalassemia in clinical setting according to the Thalassemia International Federation<sup><xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR38"">38</xref></sup>, serum ferritin level has also reported to be associated with inflammatory status via mirroring its degree in various conditions including infection, autoimmune diseases, malignancies<sup><xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR39"">39</xref></sup>. However, serum ferritin level is not the gold standard for precisely quantifying iron overload compared to liver iron content in clinical setting<sup><xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR40"">40</xref></sup> and non-transferrin bound iron in basic research<sup><xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR41"">41</xref></sup>. Thus, measuring liver iron content or serum non-transferrin bound iron level would further be investigated to make the better reflection for the actual status of iron overload condition in the future study. In terms of cognitive function, an imbalance in educational levels could affect the findings of cognitive tests. Several robust investigations of how the clinical phenomenon of thalassemia, including specific types of thalassemia, abnormal hemoglobin structure, altered hemoglobin F level, immune dysregulation from splenectomy, and each iron overload complication, are necessary to further investigate in longitudinal studies with larger sample size for their associations with changes in gut microbiota. Furthermore, certain functional studies of gut microbiota, such as the potential benefit of <italic toggle=""yes"">Butyricimonas</italic> supplementation, as a probiotic, in preventing cognitive decline in thalassemia patients with iron overload, as well as the role of each iron chelator and its route of administration in manipulating the abundance of Verrucomicrobiota in thalassemia with iron overload, also require preclinical experiments and clinical trials with metabolomics in the future study. Aside from iron chelators, effects of diet and other xenobiotics on gut microbiota in thalassemic condition are worth exploring in the future. Additionally, shotgun sequencing needs to be employed for microbiota studies due to its comprehensive characterization of microbial domains at the species level<sup><xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR42"">42</xref>,<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR43"">43</xref></sup>. Notably, microbiota from multiple sites with assessment of barrier disruption and translocation of microbial components into the circulation should be thoroughly investigated to determine the origination of blood bacteria<sup><xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR12"">12</xref></sup>. In summary, thalassemia patients with iron overload exhibited gut dysbiosis and also cognitive decline. Harnessing benefits from those identified microbes could transform life-long care for thalassemia patients by preventing the development of complications due to iron overload, at least as regards gut dysbiosis and cognitive decline.

"A Comparison between Serum 25-Hydroxyvitamin D3 Levels and Serum Ferritin in Children and Adolescents with Iron Deficiency Anemia, Thalassemia Minor, Thalassemia Major and Healthy People",,"Iron deficiency is the most common cause of anemia (<xref rid=""B1"" ref-type=""bibr"">1</xref>). According to the WHO, iron deficiency anemia accounts for 50% of anemias, which is around 30% in Iran (<xref rid=""B2"" ref-type=""bibr"">2</xref>). Patients with IDA may cause major consequences such as premature birth, low birth weight and developmental disorders in children (<xref rid=""B3"" ref-type=""bibr"">3</xref>–<xref rid=""B5"" ref-type=""bibr"">5</xref>). The risk factors of this anemia include the use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, frequent blood donation, vegetarian diet, vitamin deficiency and thalassemia (<xref rid=""B6"" ref-type=""bibr"">6</xref>). Thalassemia is one of the most common genetic disorders in humans, includes two types of minor and major (<xref rid=""B7"" ref-type=""bibr"">7</xref>). Thalassemia syndromes caused by an imbalance in the synthesis of one or more globin chains in hemoglobin (<xref rid=""B7"" ref-type=""bibr"">7</xref>, <xref rid=""B8"" ref-type=""bibr"">8</xref>). The total annual incidence of symptomatic individuals is 1 in 100,000 in the world. Beta thalassemia is common in Mediterranean countries, and the prevalence of thalassemia major in Iran is reported to be 4%–6% (<xref rid=""B9"" ref-type=""bibr"">9</xref>). More than two million patients with thalassemia minor live in Iran, the highest frequency is 10% in the coast of Caspian Sea and Persian Gulf, and its frequency is 8%–10% in the south of Iran and in Fars Province (<xref rid=""B10"" ref-type=""bibr"">10</xref>). Iron deficiency anemia (IDA) and thalassemia minor are both common in Iran, and the diagnosis and differentiation of the two is very important (<xref rid=""B7"" ref-type=""bibr"">7</xref>). Osteopenia and osteoporosis are among the common side effects that can be seen parallel to the progress of treatment methods and life expectancy in patients with thalassemia, and in various studies, bone density disorder has been confirmed in adults and children with thalassemia major (<xref rid=""B9"" ref-type=""bibr"">9</xref>). Overall, 77% of the Iranian population suffers from vitamin D deficiency, and this percentage is affected by occupation, nutrition, gender, age, and underlying diseases (<xref rid=""B11"" ref-type=""bibr"">11</xref>). Vitamin D levels in Asian children are less than optimal, but few studies have been done in Asia, especially in children, about the level of vitamin D and the factors affecting it (<xref rid=""B12"" ref-type=""bibr"">12</xref>). Vitamin D deficiency has many complications, including dizziness, headache, digestive problems, weakness, muscle pain, and frequent infections, and one of the most important complications is iron deficiency anemia, associated with osteoporosis (<xref rid=""B13"" ref-type=""bibr"">13</xref>, <xref rid=""B14"" ref-type=""bibr"">14</xref>). In iron deficiency anemia, the body’s iron reserves are depleted and the amount of serum iron decreases, then the total iron binding capacity of transferrin increases and serum ferritin, the size of red blood cells, and the amount of hemoglobin in each red blood cell decrease (<xref rid=""B15"" ref-type=""bibr"">15</xref>). The accumulation of iron in thalassemia patients with impaired intestinal absorption as well as hepatic 25-hydroxylation makes the person susceptible to vitamin D deficiency (<xref rid=""B16"" ref-type=""bibr"">16</xref>). Different and sometimes conflicting results have been reported in several studies on vitamin D levels in thalassemia major patients (<xref rid=""B9"" ref-type=""bibr"">9</xref>). There is an inverse relationship between ferritin and vitamin D levels in children with thalassemia major (<xref rid=""B9"" ref-type=""bibr"">9</xref>). Moreover, most patients with thalassemia major have low serum D levels (<xref rid=""B16"" ref-type=""bibr"">16</xref>). Vitamin D levels were lower in patients with iron deficiency anemia compared to patients with thalassemia minor and healthy people (<xref rid=""B7"" ref-type=""bibr"">7</xref>). The number of studies conducted on children and adolescents, especially in the field of thalassemia minor, is limited. According to the carried-out studies, this study aimed to determine serum vitamin D level and serum ferritin in four groups of healthy people, thalassemia major and minor and iron deficiency anemia in children and adolescents with thalassemia in Khuzestan Province in order to investigate the relationship between vitamin D deficiency and iron level, and ferritin among these patients. This is a descriptive/analytical study conducted in 2019 on children and adolescents with thalassemia aged 7–18 yr. The research population of this study includes all the children and teenagers who are suffering from thalassemia major and have a medical record in Khatam Al-Anbiya Hospital in Shoushtar and Shafa hospital in Ahvaz, southern Iran. Moreover, people referring to the children’s clinic in Shoushtar whose thalassemia minor and iron deficiency anemia were examined and diagnosed, were selected as part of the research population. This project has been approved with the ethics code IR.AJUMS.REC.1397.517 in the Research Council of Jundishapur University of Medical Sciences, Ahvaz. After obtaining the necessary written permissions, the researcher referred to the research site and started the research by making arrangements with the officials of the relevant unit. After introducing himself/herself and obtaining the consent of all the parents of children and teenagers participating in this project, the importance of the issue and how study would be conducted were explained to them. According to the sample size formula (<xref rid=""B7"" ref-type=""bibr"">7</xref>), 160 patients were selected based on inclusion and exclusion criteria. The first group consisted of 40 people with thalassemia minor without iron deficiency, the second group included 40 people with iron deficiency anemia without thalassemia, the third group included 40 people with thalassemia major, and the fourth group included 40 healthy people without iron deficiency and thalassemia minor. The mean age of the patients was 13.07±3.82, and 100 patients (62.5%) were male. In terms of vitamin D deficiency, 16 people (40%) had severe deficiency in iron deficiency group, 26 people (65%) in thalassemia major group had moderate deficiency, 26 people (65%) in thalassemia minor group had mild deficiency, and 22 people (55%) in the healthy group were normal. The highest mean level of vitamin D was seen in healthy group and the lowest in thalassemia major group. According to the Kruskal-Wallis test, there was a statistically significant difference between the groups in terms of mean vitamin D levels (<italic toggle=""yes"">P</italic><0.001) (<xref rid=""T1"" ref-type=""table"">Table 1</xref>). Moreover, according to the Mann-Whitney test, there was a difference between vitamin D levels in healthy people and people with iron deficiency and thalassemia major (<italic toggle=""yes"">P</italic><0.001). This difference was also seen between thalassemia minor versus major (<italic toggle=""yes"">P</italic><0.001), and iron deficiency versus thalassemia minor (<italic toggle=""yes"">P</italic>=0.031). However, there was no difference between healthy individuals versus thalassemia minor (<italic toggle=""yes"">P</italic>=0.138), and iron deficiency versus thalassemia major (<italic toggle=""yes"">P</italic>=0.998)(<xref rid=""T1"" ref-type=""table"">Table 1</xref>). Regarding ferritin, 30 people (41%) from the healthy group, 24 people (32%) from the iron deficiency anemia group, and 20 people (27%) from the thalassemia minor group are in the normal range. The highest amount of ferritin was seen in the thalassemia major group and the lowest in the iron deficiency group. According to the Kruskal-Wallis test, there was a statistically significant difference between the mean of the groups in terms of Ferritin (<italic toggle=""yes"">P</italic><0.001) (<xref rid=""T2"" ref-type=""table"">Table 2</xref>). Furthermore, according to the Mann-Whitney test, there was a difference in the ferritin level between healthy people and those with iron deficiency and thalassemia major (<italic toggle=""yes"">P</italic><0.001). This difference was also seen between thalassemia minor versus major and both groups versus iron deficiency group (<italic toggle=""yes"">P</italic><0.001), but there was no difference between the amount of ferritin in healthy people versus thalassemia minor (<italic toggle=""yes"">P</italic>=0.802). (<xref rid=""T2"" ref-type=""table"">Table 2</xref>) Regarding the level of vitamin D and ferritin, based on the Kruskal-Wallis test, there was a statistically significant difference between the mean vitamin D deficiency and the level of serum ferritin in the healthy group (<italic toggle=""yes"">P=</italic>0.027). In the iron deficiency group, this amount of ferritin was seen with a slight deficiency (<italic toggle=""yes"">P</italic>=0.017). In the thalassemia major group, increased ferritin was associated with severe vitamin D deficiency (<italic toggle=""yes"">P</italic>=0.05), but this significant difference between vitamin D and ferritin levels was not seen in thalassemia minor group (<italic toggle=""yes"">P</italic>=0.970) (<xref rid=""T3"" ref-type=""table"">Table 3</xref>). The data in <xref rid=""T3"" ref-type=""table"">Table 3</xref> also suggest that there was no significant difference between vitamin D and ferritin levels in thalassemia minor (<italic toggle=""yes"">P</italic>=0.970). According to Spearman’s correlation coefficient test, there was a significant inverse relationship between serum vitamin D level and serum ferritin level in healthy people (R=−0.344, <italic toggle=""yes"">P</italic>=0.030), thalassemia major (R=−0.516, <italic toggle=""yes"">P</italic>=0.001) and iron deficiency (R=−0.320, <italic toggle=""yes"">P</italic>=0.044). However, no significant relationship was found in people with thalassemia minor (R=−0.177, <italic toggle=""yes"">P</italic>=0.273). In terms of examining demographic variables using the Mann-Whitney test, the vitamin D level of men in the iron deficiency group was higher than that of women (<italic toggle=""yes"">P</italic><0.001). Moreover, the level of ferritin in the group of healthy people (<italic toggle=""yes"">P</italic>=0.010) and the group of thalassemia minor was significantly higher in men (<italic toggle=""yes"">P</italic>=0.045) (<xref rid=""T4"" ref-type=""table"">Table 4</xref>). The results of the present study showed that the highest mean level of vitamin D was seen in the healthy group and the lowest in the thalassemia major group, which is similar to other results (<xref rid=""B18"" ref-type=""bibr"">18</xref>). The level of vitamin D in patients with thalassemia major was low, and similar to the present study, most deficiency was reported at an average level (<xref rid=""B19"" ref-type=""bibr"">19</xref>). Meanwhile, the mean level of vitamin D in patients with thalassemia major indicates an insufficient level or a mild deficiency of this vitamin, and the reason for the difference between these results and the present study can be due to the lifestyle and nutrition of the patients in the mentioned study (<xref rid=""B20"" ref-type=""bibr"">20</xref>). In this study, the level of vitamin D in healthy people was significantly higher than that of people with iron deficiency, which is similar to other results (<xref rid=""B21"" ref-type=""bibr"">21</xref>). There was a significant relationship between vitamin D levels and anemia in 17-year-old children (<xref rid=""B22"" ref-type=""bibr"">22</xref>). Iron deficiency anemia significantly impairs the intestinal absorption of fat-soluble vitamins, such as vitamin D (<xref rid=""B21"" ref-type=""bibr"">21</xref>). These findings have been confirmed using correlation analysis. Vitamin D deficiency leads to increased hepcidin synthesis (directly or indirectly by increasing pro-inflammatory cytokines). This hormone is synthesized in the liver and controls the metabolism of iron, so the absorption of iron from the intestinal epithelium is reduced and segregation of macrophages is increased. Nearly one-third of the body’s iron is bound to FER. Therefore, changes in body iron reserves are reflected by its concentration in serum (<xref rid=""B21"" ref-type=""bibr"">21</xref>). The results of the present study showed that the highest level of ferritin was seen in the thalassemia major group and the lowest in the iron deficiency group. In this regard, the ferritin level of thalassemia major patients was higher than 1000, which is similar to the present study (<xref rid=""B19"" ref-type=""bibr"">19</xref>). In the current study, the level of ferritin was significantly higher in healthy people than in people with iron deficiency, which is in line with another results (<xref rid=""B21"" ref-type=""bibr"">21</xref>). Furthermore, the amount of ferritin in the thalassemia major group was higher than that of healthy subjects, which is similar to another study (<xref rid=""B18"" ref-type=""bibr"">18</xref>). Regarding the level of serum vitamin D and ferritin in this study, according to the normality of the serum ferritin level, in the healthy group, there was a significant moderate deficiency of vitamin D and in the group of iron deficiency, a mild deficiency of this vitamin was seen. However, in the thalassemia major group, the increase in ferritin was significantly associated with severe vitamin D deficiency. In this regard, a significant relationship was seen between the severe decrease in vitamin D and the increase in ferritin plasma level in thalassemia major patients compared to the healthy group, which is similar to the present study (<xref rid=""B23"" ref-type=""bibr"">23</xref>). Meanwhile, the increase in parathyroid hormone activity along with the increase in ferritin in thalassemia major patients was associated with an increase in vitamin D levels (<xref rid=""B24"" ref-type=""bibr"">24</xref>). The level of vitamin D in patients with thalassemia major was increased. High serum levels of vitamin D in patients with thalassemia despite primary hyperparathyroidism or extrarenal regulation may occur due to the activity of alpha-1-hydroxylase, an enzyme that turns 25D into 1.25D. This enzyme is present in kidneys and non-specific defense cells such as macrophages (<xref rid=""B25"" ref-type=""bibr"">25</xref>). There was no significant correlation between vitamin D and ferritin levels in thalassemia major patients (<xref rid=""B26"" ref-type=""bibr"">26</xref>, <xref rid=""B27"" ref-type=""bibr"">27</xref>). In terms of demographic variables, the amount of vitamin D in the iron deficiency group and ferritin in the thalassemia minor group was higher in men than in women. In this regard, the level of vitamin D was lower in females (<xref rid=""B28"" ref-type=""bibr"">28</xref>). Several factors affect the amount of ferritin and vitamin D (exposure to sunlight, nutrition, and the use of supplements affect the amount of vitamin D). Among the limitations of this study, we can mention the difference in the age of the studied samples, and lack of examination of other risk factors. The lowest level of vitamin D and the highest level of ferritin were seen in the thalassemia major group, which indicates an inverse relationship between these two variables. However, in the group of healthy people, a moderate deficiency of vitamin D and in the group of iron deficiency, a mild deficiency of this vitamin was seen considering the normal level of ferritin, and in the group of thalassemia minor, there was no correlation between the level of vitamin D and ferritin.

β-Thalassemia Major Complicated by Acute Myeloid Leukemia,"This report describes the rare co-occurrence of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) French-American-British type M2 in a 4.5-year-old boy with previously diagnosed thalassemia major, an inherited hemoglobinopathy, typically presenting with severe, transfusion-dependent anemia. Chronic transfusions, though lifesaving, can lead to iron overload, which may generate free radicals and potentially contribute to malignancy. Our case highlights the importance of close monitoring for secondary malignancies in thalassemia patients. Our patient born to consanguineous parents, presented with persistent fever, abdominal pain, and splenomegaly. Hematological investigations revealed severe cytopenias (low blood cell counts) and many immature blood cells (blasts). Bone marrow examination confirmed AML M2, characterized by an overabundance of myeloid blasts. Despite the initiation of myeloid leukemia-directed aggressive chemotherapy, the patient, unfortunately, succumbed to the disease within a month of diagnosis.","β-Thalassemia is a group of heterogeneous inherited disorders caused by the reduced or absent synthesis of the β-globin chain and consequent accumulation of α-globin chains in red blood cells (RBCs). β-Thalassemias are autosomal recessive disorders, with β-thalassemia major being the most severe form. Transfusion-dependent anemia is the hallmark of β-thalassemia. Untreated or poorly transfused patients may exhibit symptoms such as stunted growth, pallor, jaundice, and skeletal changes [<xref rid=""REF1"" ref-type=""bibr"">1</xref>]. The condition requires lifelong support and medical care, with stem cell transplantation being the only definitive cure. International guidelines recommend a multidisciplinary approach to managing thalassemia [<xref rid=""REF2"" ref-type=""bibr"">2</xref>]. Genetic analysis has identified nearly 200 point mutations and rare deletions that cause β-thalassemia [<xref rid=""REF3"" ref-type=""bibr"">3</xref>]. Patients with β-thalassemia major are increasingly reported to be more susceptible to developing malignancies, especially at a younger age, compared to the general population. This increased risk necessitates the implementation of cancer screening protocols for these patients [<xref rid=""REF4"" ref-type=""bibr"">4</xref>]. The hallmark of β-thalassemia major is transfusion-dependent anemia, which often leads to iron overload due to frequent blood transfusions. The excess iron is deposited in various organs, including the liver, heart, and pancreas. Iron accumulation can produce toxic oxygen-free radicals, which modify the immune system and potentially lead to the development of malignancies [<xref rid=""REF5"" ref-type=""bibr"">5</xref>]. History of presentation A four-and-a-half-year-old male, a product of consanguineous marriage, otherwise developmentally normal and fully immunized, was diagnosed with thalassemia major at six months of age through hemoglobin electrophoresis. The patient required blood transfusions every six months until the age of two years, with the frequency of transfusions increasing to weekly by the age of four. It was noted that the patient had not undergone any investigations to rule out iron overload, nor was he initiated into any iron chelation therapy. Physical examination The patient presented with persistent fever for two weeks, ranging from 99°F to 101°F, associated with abdominal pain, distention, cough, decreased appetite, and worsening fatigue. On examination, the child was vitally stable but appeared extremely pale, lethargic, and irritable, with a protuberant abdomen. He had marked bruising on the anterior aspects of both legs, measuring 2 × 4 cm and non-blanching. The patient has massive splenomegaly reaching the right iliac fossa, with no signs of hepatomegaly. The rest of the systemic examination was unremarkable. Laboratory findings Laboratory findings are presented in Table <xref rid=""TAB1"" ref-type=""table"">1</xref>. Red cell morphology indicated hypochromia, microcytosis, and occasional fragmentation. Morphologically, the blasts were medium to large in size with a low nucleus-to-cytoplasm ratio, dispersed nuclear chromatin, and prominent nucleoli, indicating acute myeloid leukemia (AML), as shown in Figure <xref rid=""FIG1"" ref-type=""fig"">1</xref>. Bone marrow evaluation Given the patient's massive splenomegaly, cytopenias, high blast percentage, and increased nucleated RBC count, bone marrow aspiration and trephine biopsy were advised. Bone marrow aspiration showed hypercellular fragments and trails, with hyperplastic, normoblastic erythropoiesis exhibiting megaloblastic and dyserythropoietic changes. Myelopoiesis was depressed, and megakaryocytes were absent. The blast percentage was 22%, with medium- to large-sized blasts showing prominent nucleoli and a low nucleus-to-cytoplasm ratio (Figure <xref rid=""FIG2"" ref-type=""fig"">2</xref>). Sudan black B stain was positive in blast cells (Figure <xref rid=""FIG3"" ref-type=""fig"">3</xref>). The morphological appearance of blasts and Sudan black B stain confirmed myeloid origin. The trephine biopsy findings were consistent with the aspiration report. Hyperplastic erythropoiesis was attributed to thalassemia major. The high blast count in peripheral blood and bone marrow, positive for Sudan black B, suggested a provisional diagnosis of AML. Immunophenotyping was performed to confirm the diagnosis. On immunophenotyping (flow cytometry), 30% of the gated population was positive for weak CD45, CD34, CD117, and human leukocyte antigen DR. The blast also expressed myeloid lineage markers CD13 and CD33. Other lineage-specific markers were negative in the blast population. Diagnosis Based on the peripheral smear, bone marrow aspiration biopsy, and immunophenotyping, a diagnosis of AML French-American-British type M2 was confirmed. Polymerase chain reaction for AML gene markers was negative, and cerebrospinal fluid routine examination was normal. Treatment The child was treated for AML M2. His marrow had less than 2% blasts by the eighth day postchemotherapy. Although he initially responded well to chemotherapy, he could not tolerate the treatment and died within one month of starting it. β-thalassemia is a genetic disorder caused by defects in hemoglobin synthesis due to decreased production of β-globin chains. This defect leads to the accumulation of α-globin chains in RBCs [<xref rid=""REF3"" ref-type=""bibr"">3</xref>,<xref rid=""REF6"" ref-type=""bibr"">6</xref>]. β-thalassemia is endemic in tropical and subtropical areas, particularly in the Indian subcontinent and the Mediterranean region. It is estimated that 5%-7% of the world's population carries a mutated gene affecting the production or function of hemoglobin [<xref rid=""REF7"" ref-type=""bibr"">7</xref>]. Patients with β-thalassemia typically present with anemia due to hemolysis and ineffective erythropoiesis [<xref rid=""REF8"" ref-type=""bibr"">8</xref>]. The bone marrow of these patients shows hyperplasia of erythroid precursors, increased apoptosis of erythroblasts during their final differentiation stage, and an increased number of macrophages. Causes of ineffective erythropoiesis include oxidative stress from excess α-globin chain due to α/β-globin chain imbalance, iron overload, and various hormonal, cytokine, and environmental factors [<xref rid=""REF9"" ref-type=""bibr"">9</xref>]. Increased apoptosis results in the extracellular expression of phosphatidylserine on dying erythroid precursors, signaling their removal by macrophages [<xref rid=""REF10"" ref-type=""bibr"">10</xref>]. Treatment for β-thalassemia includes regular red cell concentrate transfusions, precise iron chelation therapy, inducers of fetal hemoglobin, and supportive care. A definitive treatment option is allogeneic stem cell transplantation. These treatments have significantly increased life expectancy and improved the quality of life for patients with β-thalassemia [<xref rid=""REF11"" ref-type=""bibr"">11</xref>]. However, regular blood product transfusions lead to iron deposition in various organs. Excess-free iron, rapidly taken up by transferrin, becomes saturated, resulting in toxic non-transferrin-bound iron (NTBI). NTBI generates reactive oxygen species through the Fenton reaction, causing oxidative stress [<xref rid=""REF12"" ref-type=""bibr"">12</xref>]. Platelets and erythrocytes in these patients exhibit increased reactive oxygen species and decreased intracellular glutathione [<xref rid=""REF13"" ref-type=""bibr"">13</xref>]. Hepcidin, the regulator of iron status, is found at low levels in these patients compared to high free iron levels [<xref rid=""REF14"" ref-type=""bibr"">14</xref>]. Serum ferritin levels, although indicative of body iron status, are unreliable in the presence of liver disease. However, these patients' serum iron and transferrin saturation are more reliable [<xref rid=""REF15"" ref-type=""bibr"">15</xref>]. With increased survival rates, new complications like malignancies have emerged [<xref rid=""REF16"" ref-type=""bibr"">16</xref>]. The occurrence of hematological malignancies in β-thalassemia patients remains a mystery, potentially due to genetic and environmental factors. Quattrin et al. found no genetic association between lymphoma and thalassemia, with comparable leukemia incidence in the general population and β-thalassemia patients [<xref rid=""REF17"" ref-type=""bibr"">17</xref>]. A retrospective study (1999-2020) identified the leading causes of death in thalassemia patients as cardiovascular (26.0%), hematological (20.7%), malignancy (17.8%), endocrine (6.3%), respiratory (6.2%), nervous system disorders (5.0%), gastrointestinal (GI; 4.9%), psychiatric (3.3%), infection (3.0%), and other causes (6.7%) [<xref rid=""REF18"" ref-type=""bibr"">18</xref>]. One plausible theory links the toxic effects of iron overload to malignancy development. Studies have shown that elevated iron levels promote tumor growth, with high iron concentrations found in macrophage deposits within tumors [<xref rid=""REF19"" ref-type=""bibr"">19</xref>]. This theory is particularly relevant to β-thalassemia patients who suffer from transfusion-dependent anemia. Repeated transfusions can cause immunomodulation and excessive iron deposition. NTBI generates free oxygen radicals and reduces intracellular glutathione [<xref rid=""REF13"" ref-type=""bibr"">13</xref>]. Decreased hepcidin levels exacerbate iron absorption from the GI tract and release from macrophages, complicating the condition further. The potential for familial cancer syndromes, combined with acquired factors like transfusion-induced immunomodulation, cannot be overlooked. We emphasize the critical need for regular cancer screenings for thalassemia patients and further research to elucidate the precise mechanisms linking iron overload to the development of malignancies. A multidisciplinary approach, incorporating close monitoring and early intervention strategies to mitigate the risk of secondary complications like AML, is crucial. By implementing these measures, we can improve outcomes for thalassemia patients by facilitating the early detection and treatment of co-occurring malignancies. β-thalassemia is a genetic disorder that affects multiple organ systems and presents with significant complications. Although treatment advancements have improved patient outcomes, they pose new challenges, such as the risk of iron overload and its potential connection to malignancies. While the exact link between iron overload and cancer is not fully understood, it is crucial to prioritize ongoing research, regular cancer screenings, and a multidisciplinary approach to patient care. Focusing on early detection and intervention can enhance the management of β-thalassemia, improving both quality of life and reducing the risk of serious complications.",N/A,16 9 2024
"Neutrophil Diversity (Immature, Aged, and Low-Density Neutrophils) and Functional Plasticity: Possible Impacts of Iron Overload in β-Thalassemia","Neutrophil dysfunction is a form of immune suppression in patients with β-thalassemia (Beta-thal), although data on this are limited. In this study, blood from patients and healthy volunteers was analyzed. Flow cytometry analysis demonstrated an increase in immature neutrophils (CD16− CD62L+) and aged (senescent) neutrophils (CD16+ CD62L−) in Beta-thal patients compared to healthy volunteers. The Beta-thal neutrophils demonstrated less prominent chemotaxis and phagocytosis than healthy neutrophils at the baseline. With phorbol myristate acetate (PMA) or lipopolysaccharide (LPS) stimulations, some of the indicators, including the flow cytometry markers (CD11b, CD62L, CD66b, CD63, apoptosis, and reactive oxygen species) and neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs; detected by anti-citrullinated histone 3 immunofluorescence), were lower than the control. Additionally, low-density neutrophils (LDNs), which are found in the peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) fraction, were observed in Beta-thal patients but not in the control group. The expression of CD11b, CD66b, CD63, arginase I, and ROS in LDNs was higher than the regular normal-density neutrophils (NDNs). The proliferation rate of CD3+ T cells isolated from the PBMC fraction of healthy volunteers was higher than that of the cells from patients with Beta-thal. The incubation of red blood cell (RBC) lysate plus ferric ions with healthy NDNs transformed the NDNs into the aged neutrophils (decreased CD62L) and LDNs. In conclusion, iron overload induces neutrophil diversity along with some dysfunctions.","Beta-globin (β-globin) is a subunit of hemoglobin, an iron-containing protein used for oxygen transport in red blood cells (RBCs), where it is located along with alpha-globin [<xref rid=""B1-ijms-25-10651"" ref-type=""bibr"">1</xref>]. β-thalassemia is chronic hemolytic anemia due to mutations in the β-globin gene, causing a reduction or an absence of β-globin synthesis, which might require regular blood transfusions in the most severe form of the disease [<xref rid=""B1-ijms-25-10651"" ref-type=""bibr"">1</xref>]. Characteristics of the peripheral blood smear of an individual with thalassemia show hypochromic microcytic RBCs with anisopoikilocytosis (varying sizes and shapes of RBCs in the blood smear), which are able to carry less oxygen than normal RBCs [<xref rid=""B1-ijms-25-10651"" ref-type=""bibr"">1</xref>,<xref rid=""B2-ijms-25-10651"" ref-type=""bibr"">2</xref>]. Several studies on β-thalassemia have demonstrated defects in the immune system of patients with β-thalassemia as an important factor contributing to poor outcomes after infections, which is the most common cause of mortality and morbidity, particularly in patients with transfusion-dependent β-thalassemia (TDβT) [<xref rid=""B3-ijms-25-10651"" ref-type=""bibr"">3</xref>,<xref rid=""B4-ijms-25-10651"" ref-type=""bibr"">4</xref>]. Indeed, the most common cause of infection in patients with β-thalassemia is pneumonia, which is followed by infective diarrhea [<xref rid=""B3-ijms-25-10651"" ref-type=""bibr"">3</xref>,<xref rid=""B4-ijms-25-10651"" ref-type=""bibr"">4</xref>]. Although the abnormal immune responses in patients with β-thalassemia are partly related to the well-known clinical aspects of the disease, such as hemochromatosis (severe iron overload with iron deposition in the internal organs, especially liver cirrhosis, cardiomyopathy, and endocrinopathy) and splenectomy (the removal of the spleen due to the accelerated destruction of donor RBCs in the spleen or complications from severe splenomegaly in the abdomen), increased susceptibility to infection in patients without either severe hemochromatosis or splenectomy has also been observed [<xref rid=""B3-ijms-25-10651"" ref-type=""bibr"">3</xref>,<xref rid=""B4-ijms-25-10651"" ref-type=""bibr"">4</xref>]. Moreover, the increased susceptibility to infection and abnormalities in the immune responses of patients with TDβT might also be due to the translocation of microbial molecules or viable organisms from the gut into the blood circulation, referred to as leaky gut, leading to the presence of bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS; a major component of the cell wall of Gram-negative bacteria) in the blood (endotoxemia) with or without bacteremia [<xref rid=""B5-ijms-25-10651"" ref-type=""bibr"">5</xref>,<xref rid=""B6-ijms-25-10651"" ref-type=""bibr"">6</xref>]. Despite the uncertain mechanism behind thalassemia-induced leaky gut or spontaneous endotoxemia (the presence of LPS in the blood circulation without bacteremia or active infection), iron overload in enterocytes might be partially contributing to this phenomenon [<xref rid=""B5-ijms-25-10651"" ref-type=""bibr"">5</xref>,<xref rid=""B6-ijms-25-10651"" ref-type=""bibr"">6</xref>]. While gut-derived bacteremia may lead to direct infection in several internal organs (such as liver abscess, endocarditis, and sepsis), the chronic exposure of LPS to the immune system can also induce immune exhaustion, which might increase susceptibility to infection and sepsis in patients [<xref rid=""B5-ijms-25-10651"" ref-type=""bibr"">5</xref>,<xref rid=""B6-ijms-25-10651"" ref-type=""bibr"">6</xref>]. Because hemochromatosis is a major side effect of frequent blood transfusion in these patients and impacts of iron overload against immune cells, for example, monocytes and macrophages, are mentioned [<xref rid=""B5-ijms-25-10651"" ref-type=""bibr"">5</xref>,<xref rid=""B6-ijms-25-10651"" ref-type=""bibr"">6</xref>], iron chelation (the binding of iron with high-affinity molecules to remove the excess iron in the body) is a standard treatment to reduce the severity of iron deposition in several internal organs that might also attenuate iron overload-induced immune dysfunction [<xref rid=""B1-ijms-25-10651"" ref-type=""bibr"">1</xref>]. The impacts of iron chelators in the attenuation of hemochromatosis of the internal organs are well known, but these molecules might also indirectly improve the immune response of patients through the attenuation of iron toxicity against immune cells. Hence, there are extrinsic factors (blood transfusion and splenectomy) and intrinsic components (hemochromatosis and leaky gut) that can increase the risk of infection in patients with β-thalassemia, and a better understanding of immune defects in these patients may be clinically useful. In general, innate immunity is a system that responds to infection mainly to rapidly limit microbial burdens using phagocytic cells (neutrophils, macrophages, and dendritic cells) and degranulation cells (basophils, eosinophils, and mast cells), while adaptive immunity (T cells and B cells) is responsible for the eradication of the pathogenic organisms [<xref rid=""B7-ijms-25-10651"" ref-type=""bibr"">7</xref>,<xref rid=""B8-ijms-25-10651"" ref-type=""bibr"">8</xref>]. Indeed, several studies have demonstrated that β-thalassemia can be attributed to the coexistent defects in both the innate and adaptive immune systems [<xref rid=""B7-ijms-25-10651"" ref-type=""bibr"">7</xref>,<xref rid=""B8-ijms-25-10651"" ref-type=""bibr"">8</xref>], for example, reduced levels of complement components, decreased T cell proliferation, and impaired B cell differentiation with poor antibody production [<xref rid=""B8-ijms-25-10651"" ref-type=""bibr"">8</xref>,<xref rid=""B9-ijms-25-10651"" ref-type=""bibr"">9</xref>,<xref rid=""B10-ijms-25-10651"" ref-type=""bibr"">10</xref>]. Even though neutrophils, the largest population of circulating white blood cells in humans, are known as the first defense against infection [<xref rid=""B11-ijms-25-10651"" ref-type=""bibr"">11</xref>], data on neutrophil functions and the kinetics of neutrophils in β-thalassemic conditions are still limited. As such, neutrophils are the first line of defense against infections, especially bacteria, via several functions, including chemotaxis, phagocytosis, oxidative burst, and neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs), and they can initiate inflammation and control microbial burdens [<xref rid=""B11-ijms-25-10651"" ref-type=""bibr"">11</xref>]. Although neutrophils have long been considered a relatively homogeneous terminally differentiated population, evidence of neutrophil heterogeneity is currently emerging [<xref rid=""B12-ijms-25-10651"" ref-type=""bibr"">12</xref>,<xref rid=""B13-ijms-25-10651"" ref-type=""bibr"">13</xref>]. Data from the past decade have revealed that neutrophils may also exert immunoregulatory functions and display phenotypic changes in tissue microenvironments, demonstrating functional plasticity. Indeed, heterogeneous populations of circulating neutrophils have been described based on discrete parameters both in healthy and in pathological conditions (cancers, infections, and autoimmune diseases) [<xref rid=""B12-ijms-25-10651"" ref-type=""bibr"">12</xref>,<xref rid=""B13-ijms-25-10651"" ref-type=""bibr"">13</xref>,<xref rid=""B14-ijms-25-10651"" ref-type=""bibr"">14</xref>], and the traditional belief that neutrophils are a uniform population of short-lived cells has been challenged. Despite several reports on thalassemia-induced immune dysfunction, data on neutrophil characterization in β-thalassemia are still limited. Thus, this study not only aimed to determine neutrophil diversity but also sought to evaluate neutrophil functions in patients with β-thalassemia. Here, neutrophils from patients with β-thalassemia major were explored using flow cytometry analysis with ex vivo tests by several inducers.  Neutrophils are one of the important immune cells for microbial control through several functions, including chemotaxis, phagocytosis, oxidative burst, and the formation of NETs [<xref rid=""B24-ijms-25-10651"" ref-type=""bibr"">24</xref>,<xref rid=""B25-ijms-25-10651"" ref-type=""bibr"">25</xref>]. The dysfunction of neutrophils leads to systemic infection, angiogenesis impairment, and delayed wound healing [<xref rid=""B18-ijms-25-10651"" ref-type=""bibr"">18</xref>]. Although functional defects of neutrophils in β-thalassemia are partly due to an increase in immature neutrophils (band form), the chemotaxis and phagocytotic functions of the band form are comparable to those of mature neutrophils [<xref rid=""B16-ijms-25-10651"" ref-type=""bibr"">16</xref>]. Then, increased immature neutrophils do not fully explain the elevated susceptibility to infection in patients with β-thalassemia (Beta-thal). Due to limitations of neutrophil evaluation by morphological features (multi-segmented mature neutrophils and immature band form), flow cytometry analysis based on Fc gamma receptor (FcgR) III (CD16; a receptor for the Fc region of gamma immunoglobulins) and L-selectin (CD62L; an adhesion molecule) categorized neutrophils into immature cells (CD16− and CD62L+), aged neutrophils (CD16+ and CD62L−), and mature neutrophils (CD16+ and CD62L+) was used [<xref rid=""B16-ijms-25-10651"" ref-type=""bibr"">16</xref>,<xref rid=""B26-ijms-25-10651"" ref-type=""bibr"">26</xref>].  In comparison with mature neutrophils, immature neutrophils (CD16 negative cells) show a trend toward a lower antibacterial capability, which was partly due to the less effective intracellular acidification [<xref rid=""B27-ijms-25-10651"" ref-type=""bibr"">27</xref>,<xref rid=""B28-ijms-25-10651"" ref-type=""bibr"">28</xref>]. Meanwhile, aged neutrophils (CD62L negative cells) demonstrate a chemotaxis defect because of a decrease in L-selectin (an adhesion molecule) with impaired extravasation capability [<xref rid=""B27-ijms-25-10651"" ref-type=""bibr"">27</xref>]. Here, the higher abundance of immature and aged neutrophils in patients than healthy volunteers correlated with chemotaxis and phagocytosis defects without impairment on NETs, ROS production, and apoptosis (unstimulated condition). Notably, reduced phagocytic activity against fluorescent-stained bacteria of neutrophils from patients compared with volunteers (<xref rid=""ijms-25-10651-f002"" ref-type=""fig"">Figure 2</xref>B) using the pHrodo<sup>TM</sup>
<italic toggle=""yes"">S. aureus</italic> Bioparticle<sup>TM</sup> (Thermo Fisher) implied a less effective bacterial control. Despite more prominent iron levels in the blood of patients than volunteers (high serum ferritin in <xref rid=""ijms-25-10651-t001"" ref-type=""table"">Table 1</xref>), there was no difference in the apoptotic cell death of neutrophils in patients compared with volunteers (<xref rid=""ijms-25-10651-f002"" ref-type=""fig"">Figure 2</xref>F). Although the profound endocytosis of free iron and ferritin by neutrophils and monocytes/macrophages induced iron-associated cell toxicities [<xref rid=""B29-ijms-25-10651"" ref-type=""bibr"">29</xref>,<xref rid=""B30-ijms-25-10651"" ref-type=""bibr"">30</xref>], neutrophil apoptosis was not different between patients and volunteers (<xref rid=""ijms-25-10651-f002"" ref-type=""fig"">Figure 2</xref>C). Similarly, there is no macrophage cell death even with the incubation with a very high dose of ferric ions (800 µM) in a previous publication [<xref rid=""B6-ijms-25-10651"" ref-type=""bibr"">6</xref>]. Perhaps both neutrophils and macrophages can tolerate some ranges of iron overload, or the injured neutrophils/macrophages might be found only in the blood that is trapped inside the spleen (splenic sequestration). With PMA, a potent activator of protein kinase C (PKC), there were lower NETs and ROS in neutrophils from patients, implying defects on PKC and microbial control [<xref rid=""B11-ijms-25-10651"" ref-type=""bibr"">11</xref>,<xref rid=""B27-ijms-25-10651"" ref-type=""bibr"">27</xref>] in β-thalassemia. Likewise, LPS reduced CD11b (integrin alpha M for extravasation) in neutrophils from patients (<xref rid=""ijms-25-10651-f001"" ref-type=""fig"">Figure 1</xref>E–H and <xref rid=""ijms-25-10651-f002"" ref-type=""fig"">Figure 2</xref>A–F), supporting various microbicidal defects in β-thalassemia [<xref rid=""B9-ijms-25-10651"" ref-type=""bibr"">9</xref>,<xref rid=""B11-ijms-25-10651"" ref-type=""bibr"">11</xref>,<xref rid=""B31-ijms-25-10651"" ref-type=""bibr"">31</xref>]. More studies on these topics are interesting.  Not only immature and aged neutrophils, but low-density neutrophils (LDNs) in the PBMC fraction (consisting of mature multi-segmented cells and immature band form) (<xref rid=""ijms-25-10651-f003"" ref-type=""fig"">Figure 3</xref>C,D) were also more prominent in patients than volunteers. In comparison with healthy normal-density neutrophils (NDNs), LDNs demonstrated more prominent functions in (i) secretory property (high CD66b and CD63), (ii) ROS production, and (iii) T-cell suppression (high arginase 1) with a cell activity balance (high CD11b but low CD62L). Thus, the increased degranulation (upregulated CD66b and CD63) might reduce cell density and alter NDNs into LDNs. Also, an upregulated <italic toggle=""yes"">arginase I</italic> in thalassemic LDNs was similar to LDNs reported from other conditions (non-thalassemic hemoglobinopathies and cancers) with T cell suppression property [<xref rid=""B19-ijms-25-10651"" ref-type=""bibr"">19</xref>,<xref rid=""B21-ijms-25-10651"" ref-type=""bibr"">21</xref>,<xref rid=""B32-ijms-25-10651"" ref-type=""bibr"">32</xref>]. Despite a non-direct LDN and T cell incubation due to the restricted blood volume of collection in our study, the lower proliferation rate of T cells from patients (from PBMCs and peripheral blood) than volunteers supported T cell dysfunction in β-thalassemia. Although T cell dysfunction in β-thalassemia [<xref rid=""B23-ijms-25-10651"" ref-type=""bibr"">23</xref>,<xref rid=""B33-ijms-25-10651"" ref-type=""bibr"">33</xref>,<xref rid=""B34-ijms-25-10651"" ref-type=""bibr"">34</xref>] and T cell suppression by LDNs [<xref rid=""B19-ijms-25-10651"" ref-type=""bibr"">19</xref>,<xref rid=""B21-ijms-25-10651"" ref-type=""bibr"">21</xref>,<xref rid=""B32-ijms-25-10651"" ref-type=""bibr"">32</xref>] in non-thalassemic conditions (cancers, chronic inflammation, pregnancy, and infancy) [<xref rid=""B35-ijms-25-10651"" ref-type=""bibr"">35</xref>,<xref rid=""B36-ijms-25-10651"" ref-type=""bibr"">36</xref>] are mentioned, data on the roles of LDNs in T cells of patients with β-thalassemia are still very limited. While LDNs in cancer suppress T cells via the PD-L1:PD-1 axis [<xref rid=""B37-ijms-25-10651"" ref-type=""bibr"">37</xref>,<xref rid=""B38-ijms-25-10651"" ref-type=""bibr"">38</xref>], arginase I in β-thalassemia LDNs might hydrolyze L-arginine, which is an essential amino acid for T cell receptors [<xref rid=""B39-ijms-25-10651"" ref-type=""bibr"">39</xref>,<xref rid=""B40-ijms-25-10651"" ref-type=""bibr"">40</xref>], as observed by an increase in plasma arginase I (<xref rid=""ijms-25-10651-f003"" ref-type=""fig"">Figure 3</xref>L) similar to other hemoglobinopathies [<xref rid=""B41-ijms-25-10651"" ref-type=""bibr"">41</xref>]. Likewise, improved T cell proliferation by arginase inhibitors in cancers also supports the roles of arginase I in T cell suppression [<xref rid=""B42-ijms-25-10651"" ref-type=""bibr"">42</xref>,<xref rid=""B43-ijms-25-10651"" ref-type=""bibr"">43</xref>]. More sophisticated experiments are required for a solid conclusion on LDN-induced T cell dysfunction in β-thalassemia. Because intracellular iron homeostasis or iron chelation interfere with T cell functions [<xref rid=""B44-ijms-25-10651"" ref-type=""bibr"">44</xref>], immunological defects in most of our patients might partly because of high ferritin and iron chelator administration. Despite the lack of a direct experiment on LDN-T cell interaction, the increased susceptibility to infection in patients with β-thalassemia might be due to (i) an increase in immature and aged neutrophils with defects on chemotaxis and phagocytosis, (ii) an elevation of LDNs with a possible myeloid-derived suppressor cell activity (prominent <italic toggle=""yes"">arginase I</italic>), and (iii) abnormal T cell proliferation. Interestingly, red blood cell lysate with ferric ions (RBC lysate + Fe<sup>3+</sup>) or Fe<sup>3+</sup> but not RBC lysate alone altered regular neutrophils into aged cells and LDNs, highlighting iron overload-induced neutrophil dysfunction and supporting the use of iron chelation to prevent neutrophil dysfunction in β-thalassemia. Although the density of LDNs from peripheral blood was similar to the LDNs from in vitro iron overload induction, the expression of CD16, CD62L, and CD184 was different. While the peripheral blood LDNs could be separated into mature, immature, and aged neutrophils with CD184 positive in some populations, the induced LDNs expressed only markers of mature neutrophils (CD16+ CD62L+) that were negative for CD184. To make the properties of in vitro LDNs closer to those of blood-derived LDNs, additional factors are needed. Despite differences between blood-derived LDNs and in vitro LDNs, impacts of iron overload using RBC lysate + Fe<sup>3+</sup> on LDNs differed from those of NDNs. Although both RBC lysate + Fe<sup>3+</sup> and Fe<sup>3+</sup> altered neutrophils, only the former factor was used because it resembled patients’ hemolysis with iron overload. Indeed, RBC lysate + Fe<sup>3+</sup>-stimulated LDNs expressed higher CD11b and CD66b (activity markers) with lower chemotaxis and NETs compared with activated NDNs. Thus, iron overload causes neutrophil diversity and immune dysfunction (induction of aged cells and LDNs), and the use of iron chelation in patients with β-thalassemia is supported. Moreover, downregulated PU.1 causes neutrophil maturation defects in mice and humans with β-thalassemia [<xref rid=""B25-ijms-25-10651"" ref-type=""bibr"">25</xref>]. Meanwhile, ineffective erythropoiesis and chronic inflammation in β-thalassemia induce erythroprogenitor cell death, bone marrow microenvironmental alteration [<xref rid=""B45-ijms-25-10651"" ref-type=""bibr"">45</xref>,<xref rid=""B46-ijms-25-10651"" ref-type=""bibr"">46</xref>], and neutrophil diversity interference (an altered balance between aged circulating neutrophils and newly released cells). In the blood circulation of patients, aged neutrophils express high CXCR4, possibly to stay inside the hematopoietic stem cell niche [<xref rid=""B15-ijms-25-10651"" ref-type=""bibr"">15</xref>,<xref rid=""B26-ijms-25-10651"" ref-type=""bibr"">26</xref>], and bone marrow alteration might affect regular processes of immune cells. More studies on thalassemia-induced immune suppression are still interesting. Several limitations should be mentioned. First, the conclusion was based on a single-center analysis with a limited number of patients. The multicenter, larger cohorts with patients in different stages of β-thalassemia and various treatments might produce more varied results. Second, more sophisticated and detailed mechanistic experiments, such as proteomic or transcriptomic tests between LDNs and NDNs, are required for a solid conclusion on neutrophil diversity. Third, CD16 (FcγRIII) and CD62L [<xref rid=""B13-ijms-25-10651"" ref-type=""bibr"">13</xref>,<xref rid=""B28-ijms-25-10651"" ref-type=""bibr"">28</xref>,<xref rid=""B47-ijms-25-10651"" ref-type=""bibr"">47</xref>], but not CD15 (Lewis x) and CD32, were used for neutrophil categorization with limited molecular indicators for NDN–LDN differentiation. Notably, many indicators, for example CD66b and CD11b, presented in both NDNs and LDNs [<xref rid=""B14-ijms-25-10651"" ref-type=""bibr"">14</xref>,<xref rid=""B48-ijms-25-10651"" ref-type=""bibr"">48</xref>]. There are three FcγRs in human neutrophils. As such, FcγRIII (CD16) and FcγRII (CD32) are neutrophil activity biomarkers due to the recognition of immune complexes [<xref rid=""B49-ijms-25-10651"" ref-type=""bibr"">49</xref>], FcγRI (CD64) is an inflammatory marker from the binding to monomeric IgG during active inflammation [<xref rid=""B50-ijms-25-10651"" ref-type=""bibr"">50</xref>], and CD32 is frequently mentioned in the diseases with circulating immune complexes [<xref rid=""B51-ijms-25-10651"" ref-type=""bibr"">51</xref>,<xref rid=""B52-ijms-25-10651"" ref-type=""bibr"">52</xref>]. More tests on CD32 and CD15 in NDNs and LDNs in patients with β-thalassemia will be very interesting. Despite several limitations, our data provide proof of the concept that iron overload might be an important factor inducing several subpopulations of neutrophils (neutrophil diversity) and interfere with several neutrophil functions.  In conclusion, iron overload in patients with β-thalassemia induced changes in neutrophil subpopulations (increased aged, immature, and low-density neutrophils), which might alter immune responses, partly through T cell suppression. Due to possible immune suppression caused by iron overload, effective iron chelation is encouraged. The understanding of neutrophil heterogeneity and functional plasticity in β-thalassemia may develop new therapeutic approaches in the future.",N/A,03 10 2024

This study will provide us with local data, thus allowing further research to reduce burden of thalassemia disease complications. A cross-sectional study was performed, at Islamabad Medical and Dental College and its affiliated Akbar Niazi Teaching Hospital from November 2021 till August 2022. One hundred and thirty-five subjects were randomly selected from thalassemia major patients coming for routine blood transfusion at Akbar Niazi Teaching Hospital. The selected patients were seven years of age and above. All patients were on chronic transfusion therapy (at least eight transfusions annually). At the time of transfusion, chelation therapy (two injections of Desferal 500 mg/vial), was administered intravenously to all patients. Other than this, all patients were on varying levels of chelation therapy. Presence of acute illness, known cardiac problems whether genetic or acquired, serious renal, hepatic, or endocrinal disorders, other hemoglobinopathies, bone marrow transplantation or medication known to affect liver function tests formed part of the exclusion criteria. Consent; written and informed was acquired from adult patients and guardians of underage patients. After taking the history of patients, measurement of their height and weight was performed. Preceding blood transfusion, arterial pulse rate and blood pressure were recorded. Blood was drawn by aseptic means and serum was obtained after clotting and centrifugation. Our patients ranged in age from 7- 30 years, and were grouped based on their ferritin levels. Taking serum ferritin level up to 2500 ng/ml as moderate iron overload, and at which few if any side effects are observed, we grouped patients accordingly.<xref rid=""ref11"" ref-type=""bibr"">11</xref> Hence, Group-1 comprised patients with ferritin levels < 2500 ng /ml (mean = 2394.64 ±107.79), Group-2 had ferritin levels between 2500 and 5000 ng/ ml (mean = 4617.61 ± 361.55) and Group-3 with ferritin above 5000 ng/ ml (mean = 8748.51 ± 7.94). In groups 1, 2 and 3 the mean serum bilirubin was found to be 0.79, 0.90, and 1.31mg/dL respectively. Mean AST was 28.61 U/L, 35.74 U/L and 54.47 U/L respectively and ALT levels in the three groups were 40.38 (± 8.91), 48.25 (± 11.44) and 70.91 (±12.13) U/L respectively, (<xref rid=""T1"" ref-type=""table"">Table-I</xref>). ANOVA followed by post hoc Tukey’s test established a significant difference in mean bilirubin levels of Group-3 on comparison with Group-1 (p=0.000), however, the difference between Group-1 and Group-2 was not significant (p=0.713). Similarly, AST levels bore a significant difference between Group-1 and Group-3 (p= 0.00) and a nonsignificant difference between Group-1 and Group-2 (p= 0.118), (<xref rid=""T2"" ref-type=""table"">Table-II</xref>). However, on comparison of ALT of Group-1 with Group-2 and Group-3, a significant increase was observed in both cases. (p = 0.01, and p = 0.00 respectively) ALT and AST were found to positively correlate with serum ferritin. However, ALT was found to bear a more significant correlation (r = 0.682 **) with serum ferritin as compared to AST (r = 0.532**), (<xref rid=""F1"" ref-type=""fig"">Fig.1</xref> & <xref rid=""F2"" ref-type=""fig"">2</xref> respectively). Thalassaemia is an inherited blood disorder in which, depending on the mutation, haemolytic anaemia is observed.<xref rid=""ref12"" ref-type=""bibr"">12</xref> The rapid breakdown of RBCs and repeated blood transfusions lead to increased levels of labile plasma iron. Iron in plasma binds to transferrin, and if the binding capacity of transferrin is overwhelmed, then the excess is stored in various organs e.g.in the liver as ferritin. This accumulation in tissues is likely to cause damage to those organs.<xref rid=""ref13"" ref-type=""bibr"">13</xref> Measurement of serum ferritin provides a feasible and non-invasive method of assessing iron deposition in various tissues as it correlates well with liver iron concentration, a gold standard for determination of iron status.<xref rid=""ref14"" ref-type=""bibr"">14</xref> The liver is amongst the first organs to be damaged by iron overload resulting from repeated blood transfusions and increased intestinal absorption in patients with thalassemia.<xref rid=""ref15"" ref-type=""bibr"">15</xref> Excess iron causes oxidative stress, due to production of Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS) by the Haber Weiss and Fenton reactions. ROS result in lipid peroxidation of cell membranes, mitochondrial impairment, DNA damage leading to cellular dysfunction, apoptosis, fibrosis, and necrosis in target organs, including the myocardium, liver, and endocrine glands.<xref rid=""ref16"" ref-type=""bibr"">16</xref> Hepatocellular damage can be assessed by measuring liver transaminases. Faiq et al. suggested that measurement of serum ALT and AST, be performed regularly to assess liver functioning in thalassemia patients, as an increase in these enzymes is indicative of liver damage.<xref rid=""ref17"" ref-type=""bibr"">17</xref> Moreover, bilirubin, produced by the breakdown of red cells, undergoes hepatic processing and accordingly, its level rises in liver damage.<xref rid=""ref18"" ref-type=""bibr"">18</xref> Our study was conducted to determine the damaging effects of excess iron storage on liver cells. We observed significantly elevated levels of AST, ALT, and serum bilirubin in patients with ferritin levels more than 5000ng/mL. Our results were similar to another study which also reported raised LFTs in transfusion dependent thalassemia patients and confirmed iron deposition to be the root cause.<xref rid=""ref19"" ref-type=""bibr"">19</xref> Banafa et al. in their study also found serum ferritin to be strongly correlated with AST and ALT (<italic toggle=""yes"">P</italic><0.05) in thalassemia patients.<xref rid=""ref20"" ref-type=""bibr"">20</xref> A finding of interest in our study was the observation of a more significant correlation of ALT as compared to AST with ferritin levels. This difference may be due to the greater specificity of ALT for hepatic tissues, whereas AST is less specific and present in many tissues.<xref rid=""ref17"" ref-type=""bibr"">17</xref> In another study conducted by Hammod et al. in 2019, on comparison of thalassemia patients with control group, a significant increase in iron and liver enzymes was observed.<xref rid=""ref21"" ref-type=""bibr"">21</xref> Similarly, Suman RL et al in their study also recorded iron deposition to cause compromised functioning of the liver with raised AST and ALT.<xref rid=""ref22"" ref-type=""bibr"">22</xref> In addition to an increase in liver enzymes, a significant fall in serum albumin values and an increase in globulin levels are also attributed to iron overloading of the liver. Moreover, an inverse correlation observed between serum albumin and ALT levels is also indicative of decreased synthetic function of the liver parenchyma, in cases with iron overload.<xref rid=""ref23"" ref-type=""bibr"">23</xref> From our study, we can conclude that patients of β-thalassemia suffered reduced liver function as evidenced by an elevation of serum bilirubin and liver enzymes.

"Bone Mineral Density, Osteoporosis Prevalence and Influential Factors in Osteogenesis in Patients with Beta Thalassemia Major: A Cross-Sectional Study",,"Thalassemia is an inherited disorder resulting from defective production of globin chains, leading to ineffective erythropoiesis and hemolysis. Each year, 300,000 newborns worldwide are diagnosed with thalassemia major (TM) (<xref rid=""B1"" ref-type=""bibr"">1</xref>). Thalassemia affect about 5.2% of the global population (<xref rid=""B2"" ref-type=""bibr"">2</xref>). Beta thalassemia major (BTM) designates patients who experience severe anemia and often require blood transfusions to sustain life (<xref rid=""B3"" ref-type=""bibr"">3</xref>). Excessive iron accumulation, particularly in heart, liver, and endocrine glands can result from frequent blood transfusions (<xref rid=""B4"" ref-type=""bibr"">4</xref>). Hemoglobinopathies, such as BTM, can be fatal during childhood. Nevertheless, since the optimization of the blood transfusion and iron removal program in 1970, the quality of life for these patients has improved; yet they continue to face other obstacles, such as growth and development (<xref rid=""B1"" ref-type=""bibr"">1</xref>, <xref rid=""B5"" ref-type=""bibr"">5</xref>). Bone health has become a prominent concern for the patients in recent decades (<xref rid=""B6"" ref-type=""bibr"">6</xref>). The incidence of osteoporosis is approximately 40%–50% among the well-treated patients (<xref rid=""B7"" ref-type=""bibr"">7</xref>). The relationship between bone health and iron homeostasis is intricate (<xref rid=""B8"" ref-type=""bibr"">8</xref>). The precise mechanisms of bone disorders in thalassemia have been remained incompletely understood (<xref rid=""B9"" ref-type=""bibr"">9</xref>). In patients diagnosed with BTM, the occurrence of anemia and inefficient hematopoiesis causes bones widening and enlargement and leads to a thinning of their peripheral area, which stands as the principal reason for bone fragility (<xref rid=""B10"" ref-type=""bibr"">10</xref>, <xref rid=""B11"" ref-type=""bibr"">11</xref>). Other factors that contribute to the hastening of osteoporosis including; postponement of puberty, hypothyroidism, under-functioning parathyroid glands, insufficient growth hormone secretion, diabetes, hypogonadism, iron buildup in bone tissue, vitamin D deficiency, and lack of activity. Osteopenia and osteoporosis are the most common bone disorders in BTM which cause bone fractures and sometimes death (<xref rid=""B10"" ref-type=""bibr"">10</xref>–<xref rid=""B13"" ref-type=""bibr"">13</xref>). We aimed to investigate bone mineral density (BMD) status and the laboratory parameters related to bone metabolism in BTM patients and compare the statically differences between the mentioned parameters in the patients with or without bone fractures. In this cross-sectional descriptive study, 143 BTM patients confirmed with their disease via CBC and electrophoresis tests from thalassemia center of Dezful University of Medical Sciences in 2023 were selected. Blood samples for laboratory parameters were obtained 1 week following transfusion. CBC, TSH, T3, T4, PTH, Vitamin D, Ca, P, ALP, AST, ALT, SFe, FER, and Mg levels were measured. Furthermore, the patients’ BMD was measured using DEXA.  Individuals with TM experience decreased BMD and growth during childhood, which impedes their growth and development (<xref rid=""B14"" ref-type=""bibr"">14</xref>). Patients with TM experience several hormonal consequences and bone disorders (<xref rid=""B15"" ref-type=""bibr"">15</xref>, <xref rid=""B16"" ref-type=""bibr"">16</xref>). 63.3% of the examined patients have been affected with osteopenia (39.1%) and osteoporosis (24.2%). Previous research studies also have been shown a decrease in bone density in various skeletal regions ranging from 11% to 83.9%, consistent with the findings of this study (<xref rid=""B17"" ref-type=""bibr"">17</xref>–<xref rid=""B21"" ref-type=""bibr"">21</xref>). Considering the endocrine disorders and metabolic complications in TM patients, it is necessary to use appropriate treatment to reduce the complications (<xref rid=""B22"" ref-type=""bibr"">22</xref>). Medical records revealed that 75 BTM cases experienced puberty disorders, while 34 cases demonstrated delayed puberty (the absence of breast development in girls beyond 13 yr of age and absence of testicular growth to at least 2.5 cm in length in boys beyond 14 yr of age). Among the disorders investigated in this study, diabetes (9.31%), hypothyroidism (6.83%) and hypoparathyroidism (5.59%) were the most commonly observed endocrine disorders. ALP is recognized as a marker for bone turnover. Its high levels suggest increased bone cellular activity and when value exceeds >700–750 IU/L, in the absence of liver disease, it is associated with osteopenia even if it may not be clinically apparent (<xref rid=""B23"" ref-type=""bibr"">23</xref>). In the study, serum ALP levels were measured and a significant difference was observed between the fracture and non-fracture groups (<italic toggle=""yes"">P</italic><0.05). Serum ALP levels greater than four times the standard adult levels have been recognized as an indicator of bone disease in the absence of any liver disease (<xref rid=""B11"" ref-type=""bibr"">11</xref>). In this study, 53 patients (37.1%) had a history of fractures within the past years, which is a significantly higher prevalence compared to Vogiatzi et al.’s study (12.1%) (<xref rid=""B6"" ref-type=""bibr"">6</xref>). Our study showed a higher level of FER or SFe, increased risk of fracture with odd ratio 1.001 and 1.214 respectively. A FER greater than 1800 μg/L presented a higher risk for endocrine disorders in TM although the level of FER in our study exceeded the normal range; there was no significant difference in ferritin levels between groups with and without fracture. Bone disorders are directly related to increased blood iron levels, and iron overload disrupts osteoblast function, induces apoptosis in these cells and stimulates osteoclast production (<xref rid=""B24"" ref-type=""bibr"">24</xref>). On the contrary, hormonal disorders in thalassemic patients have indirect impacts on the ossification or formation of bones, and the functionality of cells that generate them. Osteoblast differentiation is stimulated and osteoclast cells are inhibited by using iron chelators (<xref rid=""B9"" ref-type=""bibr"">9</xref>, <xref rid=""B25"" ref-type=""bibr"">25</xref>, <xref rid=""B26"" ref-type=""bibr"">26</xref>). Our study discovered a statistically significant difference in the Z-scores between the fracture and non-fracture groups. It is necessary to monitor the BMD status of thalassemic patients receiving blood transfusion (<xref rid=""B27"" ref-type=""bibr"">27</xref>). To predict the risk of fractures in such patients, evaluating BMD periodically and determining both clinical and laboratory parameters is crucial. Osteoporosis and osteopenia are among the most incapacitating complications of TM, resulting in skeletal pain and pathological fractures in affected patients. Iron supplementation, which causes oxidative stress reactions, leads to osteoblast apoptosis and damage. Consequently, early detection and timely intervention aid in preventing the development of pathological fractures in these patients. Using antioxidants in conjunction with iron-chelating medications appears to be extremely beneficial in promoting bone formation in TM patients. Combination of iron chelators like, DFO (deferoxamine), DFP (deferiprone), and DFX (iron deferasirox), with bisphosphonate drugs are commonly administered to prevent osteoporotic conditions. The monoclonal antibody (Denosumab) as an anti-RANKL agent, inhibits the production of osteoclasts and bone destruction. Moreover, it is currently undergoing phase 2b clinical trials for patients over three years of age and with a Z-score of less than 2.5. This treatment may help to reduce bone-related complications in these patients.

Serum ferritin is a risk factor for pulmonary dysfunction in young patients with transfusion-dependent thalassemia,"Research into the pulmonary function of patients with transfusion-dependent thalassemia (TDT) is limited, with existing studies presenting conflicting results. We carried out a retrospective study involving 140 patients with TDT. The mean patient age was 8.7 ± 3.2 years, with a median serum ferritin (SF) level of 3791.4 ng/ml (IQR: 2424.1–5733.3 ng/ml). Pulmonary function abnormalities were detected in 46.43 % (65 out of 140) of patients, primarily manifesting as diffusion dysfunction (26.43 %), followed by ventilatory dysfunction (5.0 %), and mixed pulmonary dysfunction (15.0 %). A serum ferritin level above 2500 ng/ml significantly correlated with the occurrence of these abnormalities(OR = 3.187, 95%CI:1.312–7.741, P = 0.010), while higher hemoglobin concentrations demonstrated a protective effect (OR = 0.966, 95%CI: 0.943–0.989, P = 0.004). Our study highlights diffusion dysfunction as the most prevalent type of pulmonary function abnormalities in TDT patients. Furthermore, it establishes a correlation between elevated serum ferritin levels and pulmonary dysfunction. <list list-type=""simple"" id=""ulist0010""><list-item id=""u0010""><label>•</label><p id=""p0010"">Diffusion dysfunction is the most prevalent type of pulmonary function abnormalities.</p></list-item><list-item id=""u0015""><label>•</label><p id=""p0015"">SF>2500 ng/ml is a critical risk factor for pulmonary dysfunction.</p></list-item></list>","Transfusion-dependent thalassemia (TDT) is a prevalent monogenic disorder characterized by an imbalanced production of hemoglobin peptide chains, leading to clinical manifestations such as anemia, hemolysis, and ineffective erythropoiesis [<xref rid=""bib1"" ref-type=""bibr"">1</xref>]. Blood transfusions and iron chelation therapy are the primary supportive treatment options. However, the cumulative effect of these transfusions and enhanced intestinal iron absorption can lead to iron overload [<xref rid=""bib2"" ref-type=""bibr"">2</xref>]. Iron overload is a common complication in TDT and has been studied for its detrimental effects on vital organs, including the heart, liver, and endocrine glands. The role of reactive oxygen species (ROS), which are produced through the Fenton reaction from intracellular free iron, is well-established in causing protein and nucleic acid denaturation, resulting in cellular damage and fibrotic changes in tissues [<xref rid=""bib2"" ref-type=""bibr"">2</xref>]. Previous research has established that excessive iron accumulation can lead to heart failure, hepatic fibrosis, hypothyroidism, and hypopituitarism [<xref rid=""bib2"" ref-type=""bibr"">[2]</xref>, <xref rid=""bib3"" ref-type=""bibr"">[3]</xref>, <xref rid=""bib4"" ref-type=""bibr"">[4]</xref>]. However, the exploration of the impact of iron overload on pulmonary function remains relatively under-investigated and often limited by small sample sizes. The first report describing pulmonary function abnormalities in TDT patients dates back to 1980 by Keens et al. [<xref rid=""bib2"" ref-type=""bibr"">2</xref>]. Over the ensuing four decades, several similar studies have emerged, yielding varying results. Some have identified restrictive ventilation dysfunction as the most common pulmonary abnormality in TDT patients, with incidence rates ranging from 13.8 % to 76.9 % [<xref rid=""bib2"" ref-type=""bibr"">2</xref>,<xref rid=""bib5"" ref-type=""bibr"">[5]</xref>, <xref rid=""bib6"" ref-type=""bibr"">[6]</xref>, <xref rid=""bib7"" ref-type=""bibr"">[7]</xref>, <xref rid=""bib8"" ref-type=""bibr"">[8]</xref>, <xref rid=""bib9"" ref-type=""bibr"">[9]</xref>, <xref rid=""bib10"" ref-type=""bibr"">[10]</xref>, <xref rid=""bib11"" ref-type=""bibr"">[11]</xref>, <xref rid=""bib12"" ref-type=""bibr"">[12]</xref>, <xref rid=""bib13"" ref-type=""bibr"">[13]</xref>, <xref rid=""bib14"" ref-type=""bibr"">[14]</xref>]. Diffusion dysfunction has also been noted, with a wide range of reported frequencies from 2.7 % to 85.7 % [<xref rid=""bib2"" ref-type=""bibr"">2</xref>,<xref rid=""bib5"" ref-type=""bibr"">5</xref>,<xref rid=""bib6"" ref-type=""bibr"">6</xref>,<xref rid=""bib10"" ref-type=""bibr"">10</xref>,<xref rid=""bib12"" ref-type=""bibr"">12</xref>,<xref rid=""bib13"" ref-type=""bibr"">13</xref>,<xref rid=""bib15"" ref-type=""bibr"">15</xref>]. Additionally, obstructive ventilation dysfunction has also been observed, occurring in 3.2 %–32 % of patients [<xref rid=""bib11"" ref-type=""bibr"">[11]</xref>, <xref rid=""bib12"" ref-type=""bibr"">[12]</xref>, <xref rid=""bib13"" ref-type=""bibr"">[13]</xref>,<xref rid=""bib16"" ref-type=""bibr"">16</xref>]. Discrepancies in the incidence and type of pulmonary function abnormalities may be attributed to factors such as racial and regional differences [<xref rid=""bib6"" ref-type=""bibr"">6</xref>]. Variables that have been examined concerning pulmonary function abnormalities include ferritin levels, cardiac MRI T2∗ values, age, and duration of blood transfusion [<xref rid=""bib5"" ref-type=""bibr"">5</xref>,<xref rid=""bib17"" ref-type=""bibr"">[17]</xref>, <xref rid=""bib18"" ref-type=""bibr"">[18]</xref>, <xref rid=""bib19"" ref-type=""bibr"">[19]</xref>]. In summary, research on pulmonary function in TDT patients has yielded inconsistent findings. Further studies are warranted to establish a consensus on the primary forms of pulmonary function impairments in TDT patients and to elucidate their potential association with iron overload. Such investigations are crucial for improving our understanding of the pulmonary function abnormalities of TDT and optimizing patient management strategies. To the best of our knowledge, this research appears to be the inaugural investigation into pulmonary function in TDT patients within mainland China. The primary objectives of this research were twofold: 1. To determine the incidence and predominant types of pulmonary function abnormalities within the young TDT patient cohort; 2. To explore the contributing factors to these pulmonary abnormalities, with a specific interest in their correlation with iron overload. Ultimately, our goal is to facilitate early intervention strategies aimed at preserving patients' pulmonary function and enhancing their overall quality of life.   Our study revealed that 46.43 % (65/140) of TDT patients exhibited abnormal lung function, of which 63.79 % (37/65) was diffusion dysfunction, 10.76 % (7/65) was ventilation dysfunction, and 32.30 % (21/65) combined both ventilation and diffusion dysfunction. These results are consistent with prior research. Panwar et al. reported abnormal lung function in 68.8 % of pediatric TDT patients(N = 77), with diffusion dysfunction constituting 96 % of these abnormalities, affecting 62.3 % of their cohort [<xref rid=""bib15"" ref-type=""bibr"">15</xref>]. Likewise, an Egyptian study involving 50 patients with TDT reported that 70 % of the patients had abnormal lung function, with 66 % exhibiting diffusion dysfunction and 34 % having a combination of restrictive ventilatory and diffusion dysfunction [<xref rid=""bib5"" ref-type=""bibr"">5</xref>]. Compared with other literatures [<xref rid=""bib6"" ref-type=""bibr"">6</xref>,<xref rid=""bib20"" ref-type=""bibr"">20</xref>], our patients were younger and had higher serum ferritin levels, and nearly half of the patients had pulmonary dysfunction, which suggests that we should pay attention to monitoring lung function even in young patients and managing iron overload to avoid them from developing more severe lung diseases. The results of this study suggest that SF>2500 ng/ml is a risk factor for the development of pulmonary Dysfunction in patients with TDT. While the exact pathophysiological mechanisms underlying these pulmonary anomalies remain elusive, there is burgeoning evidence linking them to iron overload. The study by Kate C. et al. identified an association between restrictive ventilatory dysfunction and suboptimal cardiac MRI T2∗ values (OR = 0.94, 95%CI 0.89–0.99, P = 0.023) [<xref rid=""bib16"" ref-type=""bibr"">16</xref>]. Another study found significantly elevated ferritin in TDT patients with restrictive ventilatory dysfunction [<xref rid=""bib6"" ref-type=""bibr"">6</xref>]. Moreover, a study showed a correlation between ferritin and the severity of diffusion dysfunction (r = 0.308, P = 0.03) [<xref rid=""bib5"" ref-type=""bibr"">5</xref>]. Compared to those with SF ≤ 2500 ng/ml, patients with SF>2500 ng/ml had a significantly lower DLCO %pred (P = 0.02) [<xref rid=""bib5"" ref-type=""bibr"">5</xref>]. Autopsies of TDT patients have revealed lung iron deposition, supporting these findings [<xref rid=""bib21"" ref-type=""bibr"">21</xref>]. Research by Paranee Yatmark et al. demonstrated that in mice with iron-overloaded thalassemia, iron deposition in lung tissues led to increased ROS, epithelial damage, and fibrosis, all of which were mitigated by iron chelation therapy [<xref rid=""bib22"" ref-type=""bibr"">22</xref>]. Furthermore, our findings suggest that elevated hemoglobin levels may guard against pulmonary abnormalities, potentially due to reduced gastrointestinal iron absorption and improved anemia, facilitating more efficient gas exchange in the lungs. Other risk factors reported in published literature contributing to pulmonary dysfunction in patients with TDT include splenectomy, hepatosplenomegaly, abnormal thoracic development, and β<sup>0</sup>/β<sup>0</sup> genotype [<xref rid=""bib6"" ref-type=""bibr"">6</xref>]. Post-splenectomy patients, experiencing increased coagulability, may be susceptible to pulmonary microthrombosis or other pulmonary conditions, potentially leading to alveolar hypoplasia and a diminished gas exchange surface area [<xref rid=""bib2"" ref-type=""bibr"">2</xref>,<xref rid=""bib23"" ref-type=""bibr"">[23]</xref>, <xref rid=""bib24"" ref-type=""bibr"">[24]</xref>, <xref rid=""bib25"" ref-type=""bibr"">[25]</xref>]. Additionally, abnormal thoracic development or hepatosplenomegaly can restrict lung movements, impairing respiratory function. Notably, the β0/β0 genotype has been frequently observed in patients with restrictive ventilatory dysfunction, suggesting a genetic predisposition to this condition [<xref rid=""bib2"" ref-type=""bibr"">2</xref>]. Our findings illuminate the significant yet previously underappreciated role of iron overload in precipitating pulmonary dysfunction in TDT patients, expanding upon the literatures available on this subject. The robust correlation observed between elevated serum ferritin levels and pulmonary dysfunction in patients with TDT underscores the imperative to systematically incorporate comprehensive pulmonary function assessments into the routine clinical monitoring of these patients. Such a strategic enhancement in surveillance is pivotal for the early identification of pulmonary complications, facilitating timely therapeutic interventions. Moreover, it accentuates the critical need for meticulous management of iron overload as a core component of the clinical protocol for TDT, aimed at attenuating the risk of disease progression and associated morbidities, thereby optimizing patient outcomes and quality of life. Significantly, we identified SF>2500 ng/ml as a critical risk factor for impaired lung function. Conversely, maintaining elevated hemoglobin levels emerged as a protective factor, underscoring the dual importance of closely monitoring iron levels and ensuring adequate hemoglobin concentration in the management of TDT patients. While our findings contribute to the understanding of pulmonary dysfunction in TDT, our study has limitations, including its retrospective nature and the lack of longitudinal follow-up to observe progression over time. Future research should aim to include prospective studies with larger sample sizes and diverse populations to validate our findings. Additionally, exploring the molecular mechanisms underlying the observed associations could provide deeper insights into the pathophysiology of lung dysfunction in TDT and guide the development of targeted therapeutic strategies.

TDT imposes substantial disease burden with lifelong Red blood cell (RBC) transfusions [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR4"">4</xref>] and iron-chelation therapy and significantly restricts their life expectancy and quality of life [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR5"">5</xref>]. Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation is the only cure for β-thalassemia major which often lacks suitable donors [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR6"">6</xref>], and is more suitable for patients aged 2-7 years, for whom there is an age-related risk [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR2"">2</xref>]. Standardized blood transfusion combined with iron-chelation therapy remains the main supportive treatment [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR7"">7</xref>] to provide temporary relief from anemia symptoms.  China’s blood supply has faced a'tight balance,' with shortages that are seasonal, structural, and regional. The red blood cell distribution rate per thousand people, a measure of blood institutions’ clinical supply capacity, stood significantly lower than the global average, at 11.1 donations per thousand in 2020 and 3.4 milliliters of red blood cells per capita [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR8"">8</xref>]. Under these circumstances, many TDT patients in China did not receive adequate blood transfusions. A study in Guangxi Province revealed that a mere 26.7% of TDT patients received transfusions as scheduled, whereas 77% were either uncertain about or believed they lacked an adequate blood supply [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR9"">9</xref>]. According to recent research, blood shortages posed a significant challenge to implementing standardized treatment for thalassemia. In China, the recommended standard transfusion threshold for children with thalassemia was 90 g/L. However, due to insufficient blood supply, this standard was often restricted to 60 g/L, resulting in only 32.1% of children receiving the necessary transfusion [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR10"">10</xref>]. In this situation, assessing the transfusion burden for TDT patients could shed light on the current state of clinical blood use for TDT, facilitating a better balance in the supply and demand of blood resources. Currently, there is limited research on the socioeconomic aspects and transfusion burden of β-thalassemia in China, with most studies focusing on individual provinces or specific cities [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR9"">9</xref>]. In China, blood is not a commodity. It is collected by blood stations, which are non-profit organizations, and used exclusively for clinical purposes without any trade. Since 2005, a uniform national fee for blood has been in place, with a standard charge of RMB 220 for 200 milliliters. This regulation significantly ensured the safety of blood transfusions. However, the blood price may not reflect its true value. If the price of blood was the sole criterion, the monetary value of blood for patients could be underestimated, potentially impacting the development of innovative technologies aimed at reducing transfusion burden. Standardized blood transfusion and chelation therapy were major challenges for many developing countries and represent major and unsustainable health burden [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR11"">11</xref>]. Such treatments may cause infections, alloimmunization, damage from trace elements and other transfusion reactions [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR12"">12</xref>]. Therefore, considering the importance of blood and novel therapies to patients, it is essential to provide a perspective that reflects the value of blood and transfusion alternatives. The economic value of health improvements or treatments can be assessed by considering patients’ willingness to pay (WTP). The contingent valuation method (CVM) is a classic method commonly used in healthcare to evaluate WTP [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR13"">13</xref>, <xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR14"">14</xref>], which overcomes limitations in effectively evaluating the value of medical resources and services in situations where market mechanisms are absent. It enables researchers to understand public preferences for healthcare resources and services under various hypothetical scenarios, and thereby assess the value of medical resources and services [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR15"">15</xref>]. WTP elicitation methods are crucial techniques for enhancing the reliability and effectiveness of CVM assessment [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR16"">16</xref>]. There are four primary methods: bidding games, open-ended questions, payment cards and dichotomous choice (DC). DC includes single-bounded, double-bounded and multiple-bounded approaches [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR17"">17</xref>]. The double-bounded approach, known for its advantages such as incentive compatibility, precise variance estimation, and more accurate WTP confidence intervals [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR18"">18</xref>], is widely recognized as superior to the single-bounded approach in terms of both result accuracy and response efficiency [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR19"">19</xref>]. Unlike the triple-bounded method, which can introduce bias due to respondent fatigue [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR20"">20</xref>], the double-bounded approach provides a reliable balance between precision and participant burden. Furthermore, previous studies have consistently shown that the WTP of survey participants was significantly influenced by their economic status [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR21"">21</xref>–<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR24"">24</xref>].   This study investigated transfusion burden and WTP for temporary relief from anemia among adult TDT patients in high-prevalence areas by analyzing factors influencing WTP. From the results, it was clear that patients place a high value on anemia relief, regardless of their financial situation, indicating a significant WTP for health improvements. Patient gender, age, household income, and the number of units transfused in a single session were also associated with their WTP. Adult TDT patients, frequently of lower socioeconomic status, bore a considerable disease-related financial strain, predominantly due to the increasing costs of clinical transfusion and iron chelation therapy with age [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR4"">4</xref>]. A survey conducted in Guangdong Province showed that 53.2% of TDT patients’ families were unable to afford essential chelation treatments [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR9"">9</xref>]. Echoing this, our study found that a substantial majority (64.4%) of patients carried heavy disease burden, with a mere 1.3% feeling financially secure against it. The genetic TDT imposed a considerable economic strain on families, and the scarcity of blood resources in China led to frequent delays in transfusions, perpetuating chronic anemia. This anemia significantly curtailed employment opportunities and reinforced the cycle of poverty, as patients are frequently symptomatic and require regular medical attention [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR4"">4</xref>]. Workplace discrimination, stemming from frequent absences due to fatigue and physical stature concerns, further compounded the financial strain, as noted by Wai Cheng Foong (2022), where 77% of patients reported job-related difficulties [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR30"">30</xref>]. The anxieties over future life and career prospects were palpable among 70.3% of patients, as reported by Sarah H Siddiqui (2014) [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR31"">31</xref>]. The adverse effects of anemia on daily activities and work performance necessitated innovative therapies to alleviate the dependency on blood transfusions, offering a potential reprieve from the transfusion cycle and its economic consequences. Furthermore, the hospital admission process, necessitating navigation across multiple departments, was cited as onerous by numerous respondents, significantly consuming time and energy. Moreover, in light of blood shortages, some hospitals enforced strict criteria, requiring patients to exhibit low hemoglobin levels or additional medical complications to qualify for inpatient blood transfusions. Thus, the standardization of clinical blood management protocols could markedly alleviate the burden associated with transfusion. Even though patients had a low economic status, they consistently faced high disease burden. Their WTP for temporary relief from anemia was still high, and their actual payment willingness may be higher due to costs beyond the blood itself. On average, each patient received 3.7 units of blood per transfusion session, with an annual average of 15.4 transfusion sessions. The WTP of RMB 1,900 (USD 260.6) for survival in a single session and RMB 29,259 (USD 4,013.6) annually for temporary relief from anemia could be roughly calculated. However, a single transfusion involves more than just the value of the blood itself. It also includes various costs, such as pretransfusion tests to prevent immunological reactions, medical equipment costs, hospitalization costs, and iron chelation costs. This study found that elderly and higher-income patients exhibited a higher WTP, consistent with previous research [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR32"">32</xref>–<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR34"">34</xref>]. Since TDT is hereditary, patient age indicates suffering duration. Elderly patients may face more severe transfusion challenges, valuing their health and survival more, therefore demonstrating a higher WTP. The majority of Chinese families with thalassemia patients face substantial economic burden, with 90% earning less than RMB 60,000 (USD 8230.5) annually [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR5"">5</xref>]. Nonetheless, patients with lower incomes exhibited a considerable WTP for temporary relief from anemia, underscoring the importance they place on managing their condition. Patients with monthly incomes of RMB 3,000 or less exhibited WTP values as high as RMB 448.2, nearly half of those with incomes exceeding RMB 5,000. Besides, the study’s findings revealed that patients with at least a junior high school education showed a higher willingness to pay (WTP), a correlation supported by other literature [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR35"">35</xref>, <xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR36"">36</xref>]. This positive association between education level and WTP may stem from the fact that higher education often correlates with a higher economic status. Furthermore, individuals with advanced education were likely to possess a more comprehensive understanding of anemia’s health implications and to hold greater expectations for their quality of life, thus demonstrating a higher WTP. The amount of blood transfusion and its convenience also influence patients’ WTP. Patients who required a greater number of units of blood in a single transfusion session expressed a lower WTP. The increase in the number of blood transfusion units led to higher economic burden. Consequently, patients may reduce their WTP for each unit of blood due to concerns about the high medical costs. Additionally, as the volume of transfused blood increases, the marginal health benefits per unit of blood may diminish, resulting in a decreased WTP among patients. Patients with more convenient blood transfusions exhibited a higher WTP. This could be attributed to the fact that the convenience of blood transfusions may enhance psychological comfort and reduce anxiety associated with the procedure, thereby increasing WTP. Furthermore, convenient transfusion conditions may save patients additional costs such as transportation, examination, and cost of hospitalization, thus potentially increasing their WTP for blood. These findings suggested that when formulating medical policies and blood transfusion services, it was necessary to consider the economic status and needs of different patient groups. To improve the accessibility and equity of medical services, more support and subsidies may be required for patient groups with weaker economic capabilities. At the same time, improving the convenience of blood transfusion services, such as by optimizing appointment processes and reducing waiting times, may also help to enhance patients’ WTP. This study investigated transfusion burden of patients and explored the WTP for temporary relief from anemia among patients from Chinese provinces with a high prevalence of TDT. The study pinpointed key determinants of WTP, notably age, gender, income, education, the convenience of blood transfusion and the number of units transfused in a single session. The results indicated that patients exhibit a high WTP for temporary relief from anemia and that thalassemia imposes significant burden of blood transfusion on patients. The evident gap in meeting clinical needs underscores the urgent demand for innovative treatments that can lessen transfusion dependency, potentially transforming the care landscape for TDT, improving patients’ socioeconomic well-being, and enhancing overall clinical outcomes. This research contributed to a deeper understanding of TDT’s transfusion burden, serving as a valuable resource for pharmacoeconomic studies and informing effective healthcare resource allocation in China.

"Genetic modifications of <italic toggle=""yes"">EGLN1</italic> reactivate HbF production in β<sup>0</sup>-thalassemia/HbE","Reactivation of fetal hemoglobin (HbF, α<sub>2</sub>γ<sub>2</sub>) potentially alleviates clinical presentation in β-thalassemia. Prolyl hydroxylase domain enzymes (PHDs) play roles in the canonical oxygen-sensing pathway and maintain the stability of cellular hypoxia-inducible factor α (HIF-α) in response to low oxygen levels or hypoxia. Pharmacological inhibition of PHDs has been shown to increase HbF production in erythroid progenitors derived from healthy donors. Here, we demonstrated the relationship between PHD2, the main PHD isoform, and clinical phenotypes in β<sup>0</sup>-thalassemia/HbE disease. Although the targeted sequencing annotated several common variants within <italic toggle=""yes"">EGLN1</italic>, the gene encoding PHD2, none of these variants were located in the functional domains of PHD2 and were irrelevant to the clinical phenotypes. CRISPR-mediated <italic toggle=""yes"">EGLN1</italic> modifications at the functional regions; however, led to significantly reduce PHD2 expression and increase HbF expression levels in severe β-thalassemia erythroblasts. Moreover, these beneficial phenotypes were independent to the two well-known HbF regulators including BCL11A and GATA1. Our findings introduce an additional mechanism for HbF regulation in β-thalassemia and propose that targeting the canonical oxygen-sensing pathway, particularly PHD2 functional domains, might offer a promising therapeutic strategy to β-thalassemia diseases.","β-thalassemia is a common autosomal recessive blood disorder caused by mutations within the β-globin gene. Currently, greater than 200 variants are identified with clinical significance according to the quantitative effect on β-globin production [<xref rid=""bib1"" ref-type=""bibr"">1</xref>]. Compound heterozygous β<sup>0</sup>-thalassemia with the common structural variant hemoglobin E or β<sup>0</sup>-thalassemia/HbE disease is one of the most severe β-thalassemia genotypes worldwide [<xref rid=""bib2"" ref-type=""bibr"">[2]</xref>, <xref rid=""bib3"" ref-type=""bibr"">[3]</xref>, <xref rid=""bib4"" ref-type=""bibr"">[4]</xref>]. The patients are unable to produce adult hemoglobin (HbA, α<sub>2</sub>β<sub>2</sub>) due to absence of the β-globin subunit, resulting in severe chronic anemia. Postnatal reactivation of γ-globin and fetal hemoglobin (HbF, α<sub>2</sub>γ<sub>2</sub>) by genetic modifications in <italic toggle=""yes"">cis</italic> or <italic toggle=""yes"">trans</italic> of the β-globin gene has been recognized as crucial modifying factors in β-thalassemia major [<xref rid=""bib5"" ref-type=""bibr"">[5]</xref>, <xref rid=""bib6"" ref-type=""bibr"">[6]</xref>, <xref rid=""bib7"" ref-type=""bibr"">[7]</xref>, <xref rid=""bib8"" ref-type=""bibr"">[8]</xref>, <xref rid=""bib9"" ref-type=""bibr"">[9]</xref>]. The observations evidenced that the patients with high HbF levels had relatively mild clinical phenotypes. BCL11A is the well-known γ-globin regulator that has proven as effective therapeutic target for β-thalassemia disease [<xref rid=""bib10"" ref-type=""bibr"">[10]</xref>, <xref rid=""bib11"" ref-type=""bibr"">[11]</xref>, <xref rid=""bib12"" ref-type=""bibr"">[12]</xref>, <xref rid=""bib13"" ref-type=""bibr"">[13]</xref>]. However, new potential candidates have been discovered and <italic toggle=""yes"">in vivo</italic> verified [<xref rid=""bib14"" ref-type=""bibr"">14</xref>,<xref rid=""bib15"" ref-type=""bibr"">15</xref>], suggesting various γ-globin regulatory pathways. Stress erythropoiesis is defined by the increase of erythroid production typically in respond to anemic or hypoxic stress. Although the precise understanding of this response is unclear, integration of experimental data suggested distinct mechanisms from steady state erythropoiesis [<xref rid=""bib16"" ref-type=""bibr"">[16]</xref>, <xref rid=""bib17"" ref-type=""bibr"">[17]</xref>, <xref rid=""bib18"" ref-type=""bibr"">[18]</xref>]. Hypoxia is a physiological condition in which oxygen concentration is insufficient at the tissue level. The oxygen-sensing pathway responds to hypoxia by controlling the stability of hypoxia-inducible factor α (HIF-α) subunits, including HIF1-α and HIF2-α [<xref rid=""bib19"" ref-type=""bibr"">[19]</xref>, <xref rid=""bib20"" ref-type=""bibr"">[20]</xref>, <xref rid=""bib21"" ref-type=""bibr"">[21]</xref>, <xref rid=""bib22"" ref-type=""bibr"">[22]</xref>]. At normal oxygen levels, oxygen dependent enzymes known as HIF-specific prolyl hydroxylase domain enzymes (PHDs) hydroxylate HIF-α at the oxygen-dependent degradation (ODD) domain. Hydroxylated HIF-α is consequently ubiquitinated by the von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) E3 ubiquitin ligase complex and targeted for degradation by the proteasome in the cytoplasm. Decrease of oxygen levels restrains the function of PHDs, leading to the accumulation of HIF1-α and dimerization with HIF1-β in the cytoplasm. HIF-α/β complex relocates toward the nucleus and activates the downstream expression of genes involving in cellular metabolism, angiogenesis, proliferation, and erythropoiesis. Previous studies demonstrated that pharmacologic inhibition of PHDs and genetic repression of VHL increased HbF production through the HIF1-α pathway in non-thalassemia models [<xref rid=""bib23"" ref-type=""bibr"">[23]</xref>, <xref rid=""bib24"" ref-type=""bibr"">[24]</xref>, <xref rid=""bib25"" ref-type=""bibr"">[25]</xref>], suggesting the association between hypoxia response pathway and HbF regulation. PHDs consist of three main isoforms including PHD1 encoded from <italic toggle=""yes"">EGLN2</italic> gene, PHD2 encoded from <italic toggle=""yes"">EGLN1</italic> gene and PHD3 encoded from <italic toggle=""yes"">EGLN3</italic> gene. Of these three isoforms, PHD2 is the primary oxygen sensor that abundantly expresses in almost cell type [<xref rid=""bib26"" ref-type=""bibr"">[26]</xref>, <xref rid=""bib27"" ref-type=""bibr"">[27]</xref>, <xref rid=""bib28"" ref-type=""bibr"">[28]</xref>]. In this study, genotype-phenotype correlations of <italic toggle=""yes"">EGLN1</italic> and clinical presentations were investigated in β<sup>0</sup>-thalassemia/HbE patients. In addition, CRISPR-Cas9 mediated <italic toggle=""yes"">EGLN1</italic> knockdown and knockout were evaluated in erythroid progenitors derived from β<sup>0</sup>-thalassemia/HbE patients. Despite the insignificant relevance of common <italic toggle=""yes"">EGLN1</italic> variants to HbF levels, disruption of <italic toggle=""yes"">EGLN1</italic> significantly increased γ-globin and HbF expression in the β<sup>0</sup>-thalassemia/HbE. These findings supported the previous studies and indicated that PHD2 plays a role in HbF regulation in β<sup>0</sup>-thalassemia/HbE.   Postnatal induction of γ-globin and HbF expression has a significant modifying effect on the disease severity of β-thalassemia diseases, leading to milder clinical presentations. Increased γ-globin chains compensate for the defective β-globin chains through the production of HbF and, consequently, decrease the relative excess of α-globin chains in β-thalassemia. Molecular strategies aimed at inhibiting BCL11A have shown promise in clinical studies for increasing HbF levels and ameliorating the clinical symptoms of β-thalassemia diseases. However, new potential HbF regulators have been discovered and suggest independent regulatory mechanisms to BCL11A. Disruption of key factors in the canonical oxygen-sensing pathway, including PHDs and VHL, has shown to significantly induce HbF production in erythroid progenitors derived from non-thalassemia individuals by maintaining the stability of HIF-α and activating γ-globin expression. Moreover, natural variants of effectors involving the canonical oxygen-sensing pathway were associated with secondary erythrocytosis, suggesting the linkage of the canonical oxygen-sensing pathway, HbF regulation, and increased erythropoiesis. In this study, we demonstrated the function of PHD2 in β-thalassemia using targeted sequencing and experimental gene silencing. The main pathophysiology of β-thalassemia is caused by imbalanced globin synthesis, leading to ineffective erythropoiesis due to the accumulation of excess α-globin chains. Therefore, efforts to reduce these excess α-globin chains and improve ineffective erythropoiesis are of substantial interest for treating β-thalassemia. Previous studies revealed that PHD2 variants are associated with increased red blood cell production [<xref rid=""bib38"" ref-type=""bibr"">38</xref>,<xref rid=""bib39"" ref-type=""bibr"">39</xref>]. Thus, these variants may be considered as ameliorating factors for β-thalassemia. Our findings; however, revealed that the naturally occurring variants of PHD2 did not associate with red blood cell parameters in β-thalassemia. Although the frequency of minor alleles found in this study was comparable to the global population variation database, some rare or novel alleles may have been missed because of the relatively small sample size. Further investigation integrating large-scale cohorts to address <italic toggle=""yes"">EGLN1</italic> variations in β-thalassemia would provide great value for studying genotype-phenotype interactions. Since the functional significance <italic toggle=""yes"">EGLN1</italic> variants were not identified, we then investigated the effects of PHD2 inhibition on HbF induction by CRISPR-mediated <italic toggle=""yes"">EGLN1</italic> gene silencing in erythroid progenitor cells derived from β<sup>0</sup>-thalassemia/HbE. We intentionally designed sgEGLN1#1 and sgEGLN1#2 to target the catalytic relevant dioxygenase domain of PHD2. However, sgEGLN1#1 was specific to the sequence encoding a β4β5 connecting loop and supposed to interfere the HIF-1α binding while sgEGLN1#2 was specific to the sequence encoding a putative polar binding surface and supposed not to interfere the HIF-1α binding [<xref rid=""bib38"" ref-type=""bibr"">38</xref>,<xref rid=""bib42"" ref-type=""bibr"">[42]</xref>, <xref rid=""bib43"" ref-type=""bibr"">[43]</xref>, <xref rid=""bib44"" ref-type=""bibr"">[44]</xref>]. Manipulations of PHD2 were capable of inducing HbF expression in β-thalassemia regardless of <italic toggle=""yes"">HBB</italic> genotype and HbF baseline levels. Of these two sgRNAs, sgEGLN1#1 was the most effective in stimulating HbF production. Although dual transfection of sgEGLN1#1 with sgEGLN1#2 revealed knockout effects, this combinatorial treatment did not provide additive effects on HbF induction, suggesting the dominant effects of sgEGLN1#1. However, modest retardation of erythroid differentiation was noticed after PHD2 inhibition using sgEGLN1#1 alone or in combination with sgEGLN1#2. This finding corresponded to the previous study in which a loss-of-function PHD2 mutation impaired erythroid colony formation [<xref rid=""bib40"" ref-type=""bibr"">40</xref>]. While these findings suggest that the increased HbF observed after PHD2 manipulations may be affected by the stage of erythroid differentiation, the expression of key γ-globin regulators, including BCL11A and GATA1, remained relatively unchanged. This indicated that the induction of γ-globin and HbF synthesis was independent to BCL11A and GATA1, and was not caused by delayed erythroid differentiation. Similarly, pharmacological inhibition of pan-PHD using the FG4592 compound relatively increased HbF levels to approximately 5 % in normal erythroid progenitors compared to the control [<xref rid=""bib24"" ref-type=""bibr"">24</xref>]. Interestingly, additive effects on HbF reactivation were observed with cotreatment using hydroxyurea, suggesting additional HbF regulatory pathways beyond those of hydroxyurea. HIF1-α is the downstream effector of PHDs, where inhibition of PHDs leads to the accumulation of HIF1-α in erythroid progenitor cells. HbF induction capacity was suspended when FG4592 was applied to HIF1-α compromised erythroid progenitor cells. The previous study also showed that increased HIF1-α activated <italic toggle=""yes"">BGLT3</italic> long non-coding RNA and remodeled the β-globin gene cluster to activate <italic toggle=""yes"">HBG</italic> gene expression [<xref rid=""bib24"" ref-type=""bibr"">24</xref>]. These findings were comparable to our study, in which downregulation of the main cellular PHD isoform, PHD2, reactivated HbF production in erythroid progenitor cells derived from β-thalassemia. However, our study did not dissect the downstream effectors of PHD2, which may demonstrate different pathways due to the relatively high HbF baseline in β-thalassemia. Therefore, the regulation of HbF through PHD2 in β-thalassemia warrants further investigation and may enhance the understanding of unclear HbF regulatory mechanisms in humans. Although the genetic inhibition of PHD2 led to significantly elevated HbF production compared to the control, the incremental HbF was approximately 10 % of the total hemoglobin, which is less than that achieved by the manipulation of BCL11A [<xref rid=""bib10"" ref-type=""bibr"">10</xref>]. However, clinical findings have demonstrated that the induction of HbF to at least 10 % of the total hemoglobin can ameliorate clinical presentations in β-thalassemia patients [<xref rid=""bib13"" ref-type=""bibr"">13</xref>,<xref rid=""bib14"" ref-type=""bibr"">14</xref>]. In addition to the increased HbF levels, prolonged elevation of total hemoglobin is a crucial factor in substituting for anemia in β-thalassemia patients. Nowadays, combinatorial therapy is an alternative approach for curing many blood disorders. The complementary combination of PHD2 suppression and other potential compounds to induce HbF and total hemoglobin may be considered and requires further investigation to achieve beneficial outcomes for treating β-thalassemia. In conclusion, this study provides empirical evidence that common <italic toggle=""yes"">EGLN1</italic> variants did not affect clinical phenotypes in β<sup>0</sup>-thalassemia/HbE patients. Nonetheless, <italic toggle=""yes"">in vitro</italic> downregulation of a key regulator in the canonical oxygen sensing pathway, PHD2, exhibits HbF reactivation in β<sup>0</sup>-thalassemia/HbE erythroid progenitors. Taken together, pharmacologic or genetic inhibition of PHD2 may hold an alternative therapeutic option for β-thalassemia. Data is provided within the manuscript or supplementary information files.

 In 2023, a meta‐analysis was conducted to evaluate the antioxidant effects of NAC and vitamin E on patients with TDT. The study revealed a noticeable rise in hemoglobin levels in pediatric patients with TDT, with a weighted mean difference (WMD) of 1.10, 95% CI, 0.47–1.73 (one study). However, no major changes in the WMD of total antioxidant capacity were observed in pediatric or adult individuals with TDT. Using NAC displayed a substantial reduction in total oxidative stress in children, with a WMD of −7.80, 95% CI, −9.30 to −6.30 (one study).

</xref> To fully grasp the beneficial effects of NAC, a thorough evaluation of the clinical trials can help in devising an appropriate approach for NAC intake to alleviate the consequences of excessive iron, particularly the oxidative stress experienced by individuals with β‐thalassemia. This study, as such, aimed to explore the impact of NAC therapy on oxidative biomarkers in light of estimating the index of the NNT in this specific population.    Using NAC may be sufficient in alleviating oxidative stress in individuals with β‐thalassemia major. Three‐month duration appears to be adequate for demonstrating the antioxidant properties of NAC in this population. However, it is essential to promote larger, well‐designed clinical trials before establishing a meta‐analysis on oxidative stress biomarkers in the future. Individuals with diagnosed β‐thalassemia may consider NAC supplementation to help reduce oxidative indicators, particularly TOS, TAC, and OSI biomarkers, although current clinical evidence possesses a high risk of bias.

Knowledge of the factors related to the HLA alloimmunization can significantly assist in the selection process before transfusion and, therefore, decrease this complication. No risk factors have been identified, but the DRB1*11 may play an important role in protecting against the HLA alloimmunization.

Dyslipidemia and atherogenic indexes in children with transfusion-dependent thalassemia,,"Thalassemia is the most common monogenic disorder causing hemoglobinopathy worldwide. It is an autosomal recessive disorder, in which there is the reduced or absent production of α- or β- hemoglobin chains, the imbalance of which leads to hemolysis and ineffective erythropoiesis, which are the main causative factors of its pathophysiology. The homozygous beta thalassemia, non-deletional HbH and severe HbE/β-thalassemia are categorized as transfusion-dependent thalassemia (TDT) which is the most severe form of the spectrum.<xref rid=""bib0001"" ref-type=""bibr""><sup>1</sup></xref> These TDT patients need regular blood transfusion for survival, which in the long term causes iron overload, leading to an increase in the non-transferrin-bound iron and labile iron pool, causing oxidative damage, chronic hypoxia, metabolic dysregulations and cellular damage.

Hence, we assessed the lipid profile and atherogenic indexes in children with TDT and compared them with age- and sex-matched healthy children. This was a cross-sectional study conducted between November 2020 and October 2021 including the children with transfusion-dependent thalassemia registered at the thalassemia day-care center of a tertiary care pediatric hospital in Delhi, India. The study was approved by the institutional ethics committee. Informed written consent for participation in the study was obtained from parents of all children and assent was also obtained from children who were over 7 years of age. All consecutive children with TDT aged 3–14 years of age registered at our thalassemia day-care center receiving regular blood transfusions and chelation therapy were enrolled. Children with TDT who were not on regular blood transfusions due to poor compliance, those with diabetes mellitus, renal failure, hereditary hyperlipidemia and hypothyroidism were excluded. Age- and sex-matched healthy children were enrolled for comparison of the serum lipid levels. Healthy matched controls were obtained from children visiting the hospital's outpatient department for immunization, some unrelated minor illnesses, such as upper respiratory infection, or for routine check-up. A thorough medical history was obtained from the enrolled children, with special emphasis on the age at first transfusion, frequency of red cell transfusion and duration of blood transfusion. The dietary history was analyzed, based on dietary intake as vegetarian and non-vegetarian diet; those consuming non-vegetarian items at least three times a week were included in the non-vegetarian group. In the detailed clinical examination including the anthropometric measurements, clinical evidence of systemic complications of iron overload were noted. Children were asked to come after an overnight fasting of at least 12 h on the day of their regular transfusion for blood sampling. Liver function tests, including serum bilirubin and liver enzymes, and the kidney function test were performed on the same day on the Beckman Coulter AU 680 biochemistry analyzer. Estimation of plasma lipids, including total cholesterol (TC), triglycerides (TG), high-density lipoprotein (HDL), low-density lipoprotein (LDL) and very-low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) were evaluated. Atherogenic lipid indexes, the atherogenic index of plasma [(log<sub>10</sub>)(TG/HDL)], atherogenic coefficient (AC) [(TC − HDL)/HDL], Castelli's risk indexes I (TC/HDL) & II (LDL/HDL), were calculated, and compared with the age- and sex-matched healthy controls for better prediction of early atherosclerosis. The potential relationships between these parameters were assessed with anthropometric parameters, frequency of transfusion, pre-transfusion hemoglobin (Hb) (average of 3 months), serum ferritin and liver enzymes in children with TDT. Eighty-five children with TDT registered at the thalassemia day-care center were screened and, of these, seventy-two aged 3 to14 years were enrolled. Another 102 healthy children (age- and sex-matched) were approached and screened, among which eighty-three children were finally enrolled as the comparison group. <xref rid=""fig0001"" ref-type=""fig"">Figure 1</xref> depicts the flow of participants in the study. In both the groups, the prevalence of male predominance was seen. The mean (SD) age was 8.5 (3.2) years and 8.6 (2.8) years in the case and control groups, respectively. On anthropometric assessment, 40% (29/72) of children with TDT were underweight, compared to 8.4% (7/83) in the comparison group, which was significantly higher (<italic toggle=""yes"">p</italic> < 0.001).

The mean LDL, HDL and cholesterol levels were significantly lower among children with TDT (<italic toggle=""yes"">p</italic>-value < 0.001), while the mean VLDL and triglycerides were significantly higher in children with TDT, compared to age- and sex-matched healthy children (<italic toggle=""yes"">p</italic>-value < 0.001) in our study. The atherogenic lipid indexes, including Castelli's risk indexes I and II, atherogenic index of plasma and atherogenic coefficient, were significantly higher in children with TDT, as compared to healthy children. Castelli's risk indexes I and II and the atherogenic coefficient had a significant correlation with the pre-transfusion Hb level (average of latest 3 months) and serum ferritin levels. Low pre-transfusion hemoglobin was strongly associated with increased dyslipidemia, meaning that ineffective erythropoiesis was not inhibited and led to greater oxidative stress and, thus, a greater degree of dyslipidemia. This finding re-emphasizes the need to keep pre-transfusion hemoglobin above 9.5 g/dL, according to the Thalassemia International Federation (TIF) guidelines. The liver is the earliest organ affected by excess iron deposition in children with TDT, which leads to gradual damage to the hepatocytes and reticulo-endothelial cells, resulting in hepatic fibrosis.<xref rid=""bib0007"" ref-type=""bibr""><sup>7</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid=""bib0008"" ref-type=""bibr""><sup>8</sup></xref> It is manifested by increased liver enzymes, low serum levels of total cholesterol, low high-density lipoprotein and low-density lipoprotein and high triglycerides levels. The serum level of lipids and lipoproteins are affected by a number of physiological and pathological factors. Age, gender, population-based variables, such as nutritional habits and ethnicity, are a few of the important factors affecting lipid homeostasis in children with TDT. The increased incidence of early atherogenesis, thromboembolic events and endothelial dysfunctions has been found in adult TDT patients, probably due to dyslipidemia and its consequences. The lipid profile abnormality increases the risk of cardiovascular and cerebrovascular complications due to increased atherogenesis, as well as increasing the risk of pancreatitis due to elevated serum TG levels. Lipid and carbohydrate metabolisms are also affected by insulin resistance and liver damage due to transfusional iron overload in these patients.<xref rid=""bib0009"" ref-type=""bibr""><sup>9</sup></xref> This alteration in the lipid profile is likely due to diminished hepatic biosynthesis because of anemia, iron overload, hormonal disturbances and the rapid degradation of HDL and LDL by activated monocytes and macrophages, while a reduced extrahepatic lipolytic action could be responsible for the rise in circulating TG.<xref rid=""bib0010"" ref-type=""bibr""><sup>10</sup></xref> Similar to our study, some studies have also documented low blood cholesterol levels in patients with TDT, which has been attributed to the increased erythropoiesis and increased LDL uptake by macrophage and histiocytes in the reticuloendothelial system (RES).<xref rid=""bib0011"" ref-type=""bibr""><sup>11</sup></xref> Dyslipidemia in thalassemia is a consequence of lipid peroxidation associated with iron overload.<xref rid=""bib0012"" ref-type=""bibr""><sup>12</sup></xref> The low cholesterol levels were related to depletion of vitamin E and severity of thalassemia.<xref rid=""bib0013"" ref-type=""bibr""><sup>13</sup></xref> Oxidative modification of thalassemic LDL had been reported, which was related to the increased protein and triglyceride (TG) content, but decreased cholesterol and vitamin E content.<xref rid=""bib0014"" ref-type=""bibr""><sup>14</sup></xref> Hartman et al.<xref rid=""bib0015"" ref-type=""bibr""><sup>15</sup></xref> described the mechanisms of hypocholesterolemia in TDT patients as hemodilution due to anemia, excessive requirement of cholesterol due to erythroid hyperplasia, increased cytokine release due to the activated macrophage system, increased cholesterol uptake by the activated reticuloendothelial system and hepatic damage secondary to iron overload. Research by Sharif et al.<xref rid=""bib0016"" ref-type=""bibr""><sup>16</sup></xref> also showed similar increase in serum TG levels similar to our study. A study by Mashaali et al.<xref rid=""bib0017"" ref-type=""bibr""><sup>17</sup></xref> also found comparatively lower total cholesterol, HDL and high TG in TDT groups. The suggested mechanisms for the reduction in lipids were increased erythropoiesis and cholesterol consumption, iron overload, hormonal change and oxidative stress in TDT. The study by Shams et al. found that serum TG was significantly higher in patients, compared to controls and correlated well with serum glucose, cholesterol, AST, ALT, iron, ferritin and age.<xref rid=""bib0018"" ref-type=""bibr""><sup>18</sup></xref> In the study by Papanastasiou et al.<xref rid=""bib0019"" ref-type=""bibr""><sup>19</sup></xref> hypertriglyceridemia was observed in 34.6% of the patients, while it was seen in 6.6% of the controls, and a positive correlation was found between the serum TG and age of the patients.

A recent study by Sujatha et al.<xref rid=""bib0007"" ref-type=""bibr""><sup>7</sup></xref> evaluated 290 adult patients with stroke and found that the CRI-I and AC significantly contributed to the risk of stroke. The authors also suggested that AIP values of −0.3 to 0.1, 0.10 to 0.24 and > 0.24, associated with low, medium and high cardiovascular risk in the adult population, respectively. A study by Dobiasova et al. also found that the atherogenic index plasma value of over 0.24 is a significant predictor for cardiovascular diseases.<xref rid=""bib0025"" ref-type=""bibr""><sup>25</sup></xref> In our study, the mean AIP of the study group was 0.57 ± 0.25, which is quite high, as compared to the values given by adult studies. Though we could not find any separate cutoff for these indexes for the pediatric population, a higher AIP index indicates the significantly increased risk atherosclerosis in this group. In this study, children with TDT had significantly high CRI-I and CRI-II. A recent meta-analysis and systematic review in an adult population showed that a higher TG/HDL ratio was associated with a 43% higher risk of cardiovascular events, whereas the per unit increment of the TG/HDL-C ratio was associated with an 8% higher risk of cardiovascular complications, and it was concluded that the TG/HDL-C ratio may be useful in the prediction and prevention of cardiovascular disease.<xref rid=""bib0026"" ref-type=""bibr""><sup>26</sup></xref> Most studies evaluating the significance of these indexes were performed on the adult population and we could only find very few studies which included pediatric patients.

Thus, the study adds to the importance of the screening and monitoring of TDT children for atherosclerotic complications, such as cardiovascular morbidities and cerebrovascular accidents. As very few studies have looked into this aspect of lipid indexes in TDT children, more research is needed in this field for the development of effective preventive strategies in this cohort of children.

Renal Findings in Patients with Thalassemia at Abdominal Ultrasound: Should We Still Talk about “Incidentalomas”? Results of a Long-Term Follow-Up,"We retrospectively collected all ultrasound imaging data of our thalassemia patients over a period of 10 years with the aim of assessing the prevalence and the risk factors of renal stones and cysts. Moreover, we assessed the incidence of renal-cell carcinoma (RCC) among thalassemia patients (133 with thalassemia major (TM) and 157 with thalassemia intermedia (TI)) and its association with demographic and clinical findings. Renal stones were detected in 15.2% of patients. In the multivariable Cox regression analysis, the independent predictors were blood consumption, splenectomy, and proteinuria. Renal cysts were detected in 18.4% of patients. In the multivariable analysis, age emerged as the only independent predictor. After the first detection, 35% of the patients showed changes in the number, size, or grading of renal cysts. During the study period, the crude incidence rate of RCC was 75.9 cases per 100,000 person-years. The most frequent histological subtype (80%) included clear-cell RCC. In total, 80% of patients with RCC had TM and all were positive for hepatitis C virus antibodies. Thalassemia patients are significantly affected by asymptomatic renal diseases such as stones, cysts, and cancer, suggesting the need for regular screening by imaging.","Thalassemia syndromes represent the most common inherited monogenic disorders worldwide, and in Italy they constitute an important public-health challenge, affecting about 7000 people [<xref rid=""B1-diagnostics-14-02047"" ref-type=""bibr"">1</xref>]. Thalassemias are heterogeneous disorders caused by reduced or absent alpha or beta globin synthesis, which are major components of adult hemoglobin A (HbA, α2β2), resulting in an imbalance of the globin chains [<xref rid=""B2-diagnostics-14-02047"" ref-type=""bibr"">2</xref>,<xref rid=""B3-diagnostics-14-02047"" ref-type=""bibr"">3</xref>].

In fact, anemia decreases the systemic vascular resistance and generates hyperdynamic circulation in glomeruli [<xref rid=""B11-diagnostics-14-02047"" ref-type=""bibr"">11</xref>]; the consequent rise in hydrostatic pressure within the glomerular capillaries determines glomerular hyperfiltration [<xref rid=""B12-diagnostics-14-02047"" ref-type=""bibr"">12</xref>], which is responsible for arterial wall stretching and ultimately leads to vascular damage and sclerosis [<xref rid=""B13-diagnostics-14-02047"" ref-type=""bibr"">13</xref>]. Anemia is also responsible for hypoxic damage [<xref rid=""B14-diagnostics-14-02047"" ref-type=""bibr"">14</xref>], particularly involving cells in the proximal tubule because of their high rate of metabolic activity, and thus can lead to cellular apoptosis [<xref rid=""B15-diagnostics-14-02047"" ref-type=""bibr"">15</xref>,<xref rid=""B16-diagnostics-14-02047"" ref-type=""bibr"">16</xref>]. In β-TM patients, a link between proximal tubular dysfunction and intracellular iron deposition has been previously reported [<xref rid=""B12-diagnostics-14-02047"" ref-type=""bibr"">12</xref>,<xref rid=""B17-diagnostics-14-02047"" ref-type=""bibr"">17</xref>], as iron overload causes tubular oxidative stress, leading to tubular lipid peroxidation and subsequent cell injury/death, and theoretically also to cancer [<xref rid=""B18-diagnostics-14-02047"" ref-type=""bibr"">18</xref>,<xref rid=""B19-diagnostics-14-02047"" ref-type=""bibr"">19</xref>]. Experimental research using an animal model of β-TM subjected to prolonged iron loading revealed that rats accumulated iron in glomeruli and in the proximal but not in distal tubules, with signs of marked glomerulosclerosis, tubular atrophy, and interstitial fibrosis [<xref rid=""B20-diagnostics-14-02047"" ref-type=""bibr"">20</xref>]. On the other hand, iron may impact on renal arterial vasodilation, which is a cofactor for renal prostaglandin synthesis [<xref rid=""B21-diagnostics-14-02047"" ref-type=""bibr"">21</xref>], and therefore, in the case of “relative iron depletion”, iron chelators could be responsible for the reduced glomerular filtration (GFR) observed with deferoxamine and deferasirox. Tubular injury is the cause of many urine abnormalities seen in β-TM patients, such as an increase in proteinuria, albuminuria, calciuria, phosphaturia, uricosuria, and β2-microglobulin [<xref rid=""B22-diagnostics-14-02047"" ref-type=""bibr"">22</xref>,<xref rid=""B23-diagnostics-14-02047"" ref-type=""bibr"">23</xref>]. In a recent metabolomic study, 60% of patients exhibited hypercalciuria and many individuals had impaired urine concentration. Several amino acids, N-methyl compounds, and organic acids were overexcreted in the urine of thalassemic patients compared with controls [<xref rid=""B24-diagnostics-14-02047"" ref-type=""bibr"">24</xref>]. Such a raised excretion in some urinary solutes in thalassemia patients is likely at the basis of the high prevalence of nephrolithiasis seen in this population [<xref rid=""B25-diagnostics-14-02047"" ref-type=""bibr"">25</xref>,<xref rid=""B26-diagnostics-14-02047"" ref-type=""bibr"">26</xref>]. Abdominal ultrasonography (US) is an important component in the monitoring of thalassemia patients, due to the frequent need to both assess the size and structure of abdominal organs and to screen patients affected by chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection [<xref rid=""B27-diagnostics-14-02047"" ref-type=""bibr"">27</xref>,<xref rid=""B28-diagnostics-14-02047"" ref-type=""bibr"">28</xref>]. As a result of the growth in imaging utilization in patients with thalassemia, a high prevalence and/or incidence of nephrolithiasis, renal cysts, and tumors were also described in this population [<xref rid=""B26-diagnostics-14-02047"" ref-type=""bibr"">26</xref>,<xref rid=""B29-diagnostics-14-02047"" ref-type=""bibr"">29</xref>]. In most cases, these reports were from asymptomatic patients and therefore were frequently classified as incidentalomas as in the case of non-thalassemic populations.  We retrospectively collected all US imaging data of our thalassemia patients over a period of 10 years with the aim of assessing the prevalence and risk factors of renal stones and cysts. Moreover, this study aimed at assessing the lifetime incidence of renal-cell carcinoma (RCC) among thalassemia patients and its association with the type of thalassemia and demographic and clinical findings.    Renal dysfunction is a frequent and emerging complication in patients suffering from thalassemia. The increasing life expectancy of patients with thalassemia and the tendency (even higher with respect to the general population) to develop complications and comorbidities prompted us to accurately evaluate radiological renal findings alongside aging in our population of patients with thalassemia [<xref rid=""B39-diagnostics-14-02047"" ref-type=""bibr"">39</xref>]. Abdominal ultrasonography is a routine examination in our patients with thalassemia and therefore all radiologic findings at US were for the first time evaluated simultaneously and correlated to several demographic, clinical, and laboratory data. Our findings confirmed previous evidence that stones and cysts are frequent among our populations [<xref rid=""B26-diagnostics-14-02047"" ref-type=""bibr"">26</xref>,<xref rid=""B39-diagnostics-14-02047"" ref-type=""bibr"">39</xref>]. Renal stones are a recognized complication in patients with thalassemia and have a multifactorial pathogenesis which involves the presence of hypercalciuria, hyperoxaluria, hypocitraturia, and hyperuricosuria, and is differently associated with tubular dysfunction linked mostly to excessive iron deposition in the renal tubules [<xref rid=""B8-diagnostics-14-02047"" ref-type=""bibr"">8</xref>,<xref rid=""B40-diagnostics-14-02047"" ref-type=""bibr"">40</xref>,<xref rid=""B41-diagnostics-14-02047"" ref-type=""bibr"">41</xref>,<xref rid=""B42-diagnostics-14-02047"" ref-type=""bibr"">42</xref>]. In agreement with a previous observation [<xref rid=""B43-diagnostics-14-02047"" ref-type=""bibr"">43</xref>], renal stone formation involved more frequently splenectomized patients. In that series, encompassing only patients with thalassemia intermedia, potential underlying mechanisms in splenectomized patients that might contribute to stone formation were the significantly higher levels of average urate and nucleated red blood cells (NRBCs). In our current series, data on NRBCs were not available, and a significantly higher occurrence of nephrolithiasis was detected in patients with TM compared with those with TI. The role of splenectomy seems not to be related to uric acid, whose levels were comparable between patients with and without renal stones, suggesting both the presence of a suppressive effect of regular transfusions on erythopoietic activity and uric acid generation [<xref rid=""B44-diagnostics-14-02047"" ref-type=""bibr"">44</xref>], and the higher use in TM of Deferasirox, a chelator with documented activity in uric acid reduction [<xref rid=""B45-diagnostics-14-02047"" ref-type=""bibr"">45</xref>]. Differently, splenectomy, whose rate is decreasing particularly in patients with TI because of the early and late occurrence of complications [<xref rid=""B46-diagnostics-14-02047"" ref-type=""bibr"">46</xref>,<xref rid=""B47-diagnostics-14-02047"" ref-type=""bibr"">47</xref>], may simply mark the presence of more severe forms of thalassemia which are more prone to renal stone formation [<xref rid=""B48-diagnostics-14-02047"" ref-type=""bibr"">48</xref>,<xref rid=""B49-diagnostics-14-02047"" ref-type=""bibr"">49</xref>]. However, differently from that report, a significantly higher occurrence of nephrolithiasis was detected in patients with higher blood consumption and signs of renal impairment such as increased creatinine level and proteinuria. This finding suggests that renal iron overload and the related tubular dysfunction may be the pivotal contributors in renal stone formation. Further studies should be carried out to evaluate if renal iron deposition may correlate with renal stone formation.  Our data regarding prevalence of renal cysts at the baseline and detection rate during the observation time are fully in agreement with a previous report exploring the prevalence of extracardiac findings encompassing renal cysts at MRI evaluation [<xref rid=""B39-diagnostics-14-02047"" ref-type=""bibr"">39</xref>]. At baseline observation, patients with cysts were older and aging emerged as the independent predictor for further development of renal cysts. More interestingly, our longitudinal retrospective evaluation highlighted in a quite detailed way that renal cysts underwent evolution not only in terms of size but also in terms of Bosniak classification. Both the occurrence of a new cist and its progression were more frequently observed among patients with increased age and BMI and hypertension. Overall, our data on renal cyst progression indicate an increased risk compared to that observed in the general population [<xref rid=""B50-diagnostics-14-02047"" ref-type=""bibr"">50</xref>], suggesting the need for accurate monitoring among our population once a cyst is identified.  In our thalassemic population, the detection of 10 cases of RCC, all asymptomatic, corresponding to a crude incidence rate of 75.9 cases per 100,000 people, seems to be the most relevant finding of this report. It is well worth noting that 30% of these cases came from the canceration of a renal cyst, which usually is a small-probability event [<xref rid=""B51-diagnostics-14-02047"" ref-type=""bibr"">51</xref>,<xref rid=""B52-diagnostics-14-02047"" ref-type=""bibr"">52</xref>]. Bearing in mind that RCC has an incidence of 18.5 cases per 100,000 people in Italy, with a cumulative risk of 1.01 and with a peak incidence occurring between 60 and 70 years of age [<xref rid=""B53-diagnostics-14-02047"" ref-type=""bibr"">53</xref>], the findings of the present study confirm our previous observation [<xref rid=""B29-diagnostics-14-02047"" ref-type=""bibr"">29</xref>] and again suggest the presence of a particular renal cancer risk among our thalassemic patients, mainly among those with thalassemia major. This finding contrasts with a recent survey collecting data from eight Italian specialized centers where the incidence of malignant neoplasms in hemoglobinopathies as well as their sites and features were evaluated. The researchers found that the liver was the most common site of tumors in both sexes, showing a higher incidence (190 cases per 100,000 person-years) compared to the general population, but they did not find an increased incidence of RCC [<xref rid=""B54-diagnostics-14-02047"" ref-type=""bibr"">54</xref>]. Furthermore, there is no evidence that during our observation period, a regional risk factor may have influenced this particular incidence, as data from the regional/local registry showed a slight reduced incidence as compared with those coming from the national registry [<xref rid=""B55-diagnostics-14-02047"" ref-type=""bibr"">55</xref>]. In the general population, the most solid risk factors of RCC are age [<xref rid=""B53-diagnostics-14-02047"" ref-type=""bibr"">53</xref>], gender [<xref rid=""B53-diagnostics-14-02047"" ref-type=""bibr"">53</xref>], ethnicity [<xref rid=""B56-diagnostics-14-02047"" ref-type=""bibr"">56</xref>], a history of smoking [<xref rid=""B57-diagnostics-14-02047"" ref-type=""bibr"">57</xref>,<xref rid=""B58-diagnostics-14-02047"" ref-type=""bibr"">58</xref>], hypertension [<xref rid=""B58-diagnostics-14-02047"" ref-type=""bibr"">58</xref>,<xref rid=""B59-diagnostics-14-02047"" ref-type=""bibr"">59</xref>], and obesity [<xref rid=""B60-diagnostics-14-02047"" ref-type=""bibr"">60</xref>]. In the general population, there is a 1.5:1 male predominance [<xref rid=""B53-diagnostics-14-02047"" ref-type=""bibr"">53</xref>]. The observed inverted gender relationship in our series is remarkable, but remains unexplained. Despite other risk factors being occasionally present among our patients, all were positive for HCV antibodies. One patient had chronic HCV infection while the remaining nine patients had eradicated the virus spontaneously (N = 5) or after the treatment with antiviral therapy (N = 4). Moreover, iron overload indices showed hepatic iron overload and/or a ferritin level ≥1000 ng/mL. In thalassemic patients, chronic HCV infection has been linked to several extrahepatic diseases [<xref rid=""B61-diagnostics-14-02047"" ref-type=""bibr"">61</xref>,<xref rid=""B62-diagnostics-14-02047"" ref-type=""bibr"">62</xref>,<xref rid=""B63-diagnostics-14-02047"" ref-type=""bibr"">63</xref>] and, according to a systematic review and meta-analysis, in the general population, the risk of renal disease was significantly higher in subjects with positive HCV serologic status compared to non-infected patients [<xref rid=""B64-diagnostics-14-02047"" ref-type=""bibr"">64</xref>]. Moreover, HCV infection has also been directly associated with an increased risk of renal-cell carcinoma, as observed in several epidemiologic studies [<xref rid=""B65-diagnostics-14-02047"" ref-type=""bibr"">65</xref>,<xref rid=""B66-diagnostics-14-02047"" ref-type=""bibr"">66</xref>] and confirmed in a subsequent meta-analysis [<xref rid=""B67-diagnostics-14-02047"" ref-type=""bibr"">67</xref>]. Therefore, in our series, iron overload and previous HCV infection may have represented important oncogenic players that may have driven both renal carcinogenesis and the canceration of cysts. Notably, two cases were also affected by HCC. On the whole, these data further reinforce the need for both early HCV clearance and iron chelation in patients with thalassemia and HCV infection. Similarly, it is conceivable that in patients with present and past HCV infection, the US surveillance based on liver semestral abdominal ultrasound should also encompass the evaluation of renal cyst status. Further studies are needed to confirm this hypothesis, and the rate of HCV infection in the population evaluated for the estimate of RCC incidence should always be investigated.  Currently, abdominal US examinations are frequently requested in patients with thalassemia mainly for surveillance for the risk of HCC in patients with previous/contemporary HCV infection. Data from this report indicate that patients with thalassemia are significantly affected by asymptomatic renal diseases such as lithiasis, cysts, and cancer, which, in most cases, are detected incidentally by investigating various non-specific symptoms and other abdominal diseases, and are poorly associated with renal impairment and/or with biochemical markers. Further prospective studies are needed to better define the incidence and risk factors of these “incidentalomas”, that likely could not be considered an unwanted “side-effect” of imaging, but a real complication of thalassemia which would merit regular screening by US. Evidently, there is a need for the assessment of the performance of abdominal US in detecting renal disease and of the relative cost for the healthcare system, but several benefits in terms of the early diagnosis of renal diseases, patient outcomes, and the possibility to establish more precise guidelines for screening and monitoring in thalassemia patients are likely expected.",N/A,15 9 2024
"Impact of Foot Reflexology Versus Simple Massage on Vital Signs, Anxiety, and Pain During Blood Transfusion Among Children With Thalassemia","Introduction Children with thalassemia often require repeated invasive treatments and frequent hospitalizations, resulting in pain, anxiety, and altered vital signs. Implementing non-invasive, non-pharmacological, and inexpensive complementary practices can benefit both the child and their family. Aim This study aimed to evaluate the impact of foot reflexology versus simple massage on vital signs, anxiety, and pain induced by blood transfusions in children with thalassemia. Materials and methods  An experimental study was conducted on 60 children with thalassemia; children aged 2-13 years were selected by systematic random sampling. The participants were separated into two groups: 30 children received foot reflexology and 30 children received a simple massage. Data were collected using a self-structured demographic profile, vital signs record sheet, standard Observational Scale of Behavioral Distress-Revised (OSBD-R) scale, and visual analog scale (VAS). Paired and unpaired t-tests were used to evaluate the effects of the interventions. The chi-square test was utilized to evaluate the relationship between demographic and dependent variables. Result Foot reflexology showed a significant difference (P < 0.05) in systolic and diastolic blood pressure and a highly significant difference (P < 0.0001) in anxiety and pain. The simple massage group showed a significant effect on temperature, anxiety, and pain. Both groups demonstrated a significant impact (P < 0.05) on systolic blood pressure and pain after the intervention. Conclusion  Most children were diagnosed with thalassemia during infancy, had a history of both parent’s thalassemia minor, and were Rh+ve. Foot reflexology was more effective in reducing anxiety and pain than simple massage. Additionally, foot reflexology had a significant effect on systolic and diastolic blood pressure, while simple massage significantly affected temperature in children with thalassemia.","Thalassemia is a genetic blood disorder affecting approximately 15 million people worldwide, with around 240 million individuals carrying the thalassemia trait. Every year, approximately 100,000 children worldwide are born with thalassemia major, with India contributing to about 10,000 of these cases [<xref rid=""REF1"" ref-type=""bibr"">1</xref>]. According to the National Health Mission (2016) report, India is estimated to have between 1,00,000 and 1,50,000 children diagnosed with thalassemia major, while nearly 42 million individuals worldwide are carriers of the β thalassemia trait [<xref rid=""REF1"" ref-type=""bibr"">1</xref>]. Thalassemia major, or Cooley’s anemia, occurs when a person inherits a variant gene from both parents. Although infants with this condition are typically healthy at birth, symptoms emerge around six months of age. The disease is characterized by moderate to severe anemia, requiring frequent blood transfusions and continuous medical care. It can significantly impact lifespan and overall quality of life. Thalassemia minor, or beta thalassemia trait, occurs when a person inherits a variant gene from one parent. Carriers typically have no symptoms or only mild anemia and usually do not require treatment. According to the Thalassemia Foundation of Canada, the genetic defect in thalassemia results in severe anemia and bone marrow expansion as the body tries to produce more red blood cells. Low hemoglobin levels reduce blood’s ability to carry oxygen, causing fatigue and shortness of breath and impacting overall oxygen levels. Regular blood transfusions and iron chelation therapy are essential to prevent severe anemia. Transfusions raise hemoglobin levels, reducing anemia [<xref rid=""REF2"" ref-type=""bibr"">2</xref>]. Thalassemia is a hereditary blood disorder caused by mutations in the genes that produce hemoglobin, the oxygen-carrying protein in red blood cells. These genetic changes lead to reduced or defective hemoglobin production, resulting in the breakdown of red blood cells and causing severe anemia. Children diagnosed with beta-thalassemia major frequently need to undergo repeated invasive procedures, like venipuncture or blood transfusions, and frequent hospitalizations [<xref rid=""REF3"" ref-type=""bibr"">3</xref>]. During hospitalization, children often experience separation anxiety from family, activity restrictions, pain from procedures, side effects of iron chelation therapy, and fear of mortality. These factors can contribute to significant anxiety and distress in children [<xref rid=""REF4"" ref-type=""bibr"">4</xref>]. Iron chelation therapy eliminates excess iron from the body and is commonly used for patients with conditions like thalassemia who undergo frequent blood transfusions. Common chelating agents include deferoxamine, deferasirox, and deferiprone. In the past, foot reflexology and other alternative therapies were historically perceived as traditional, non-scientific remedies predominantly embraced by individuals with lower levels of education, belonging to lower socioeconomic classes, and among the elderly. However, as foot reflexology gains popularity among patients and healthcare professionals alike, there is a growing effort to scientifically evaluate its effectiveness [<xref rid=""REF5"" ref-type=""bibr"">5</xref>]. Foot reflexology uses pressure on specific spots on the feet that are thought to connect to different body parts, aiming to improve overall health. Simple massage, on the other hand, involves general, gentle rubbing of muscles to help with relaxation without focusing on specific areas. Reflexology operates on the principle that the soles of the feet mirror the entire body. Through thumb and finger pressure on specific reflex points, each corresponding to different body parts, reflexologists aim to promote overall well-being. These reflex points range from the distal phalanx of the big toe (representing the head) to the calcaneum (representing the pelvis) [<xref rid=""REF6"" ref-type=""bibr"">6</xref>]. The use of non-invasive, non-pharmacological, simple, and cost-effective nursing practices provides substantial benefits for children and their families, alleviating the financial strain on parents [<xref rid=""REF7"" ref-type=""bibr"">7</xref>]. Many studies highlight the impact of foot reflexology on pain reduction. Integrating massage therapy into nursing care enhances holistic patient management. Emphasizing these complementary therapies, which nurses can administer independently, supports nursing practice autonomy and patient care quality [<xref rid=""REF6"" ref-type=""bibr"">6</xref>]. This topic has not been studied in India before. Therefore, the researcher felt the need to undertake the current study to contribute to the body of knowledge in nursing and to help children suffering from thalassemia. The following are the objectives of this study: (1) to assess the vital signs, level of anxiety, and level of pain of children with thalassemia receiving blood transfusion; (2) to determine the effect of foot reflexology versus simple massage on vital signs, anxiety, and pain produced by blood transfusion in children with thalassemia; and (3) to find the association between vital signs, level of anxiety, and level of pain in children receiving blood transfusion with selected demographic variables. A quantitative research approach and experimental research design were used to study the effect of foot reflexology and simple massage on vital signs, anxiety, and pain produced by blood transfusion in children with thalassemia admitted to a pediatric ward in selected tertiary care hospitals in western Maharashtra, India. Research tools include socio-demographic variables, such as age, gender, residence, religion, socio-economic status, age of diagnosis (in years and months), family history of thalassemia, blood transfusion starting age, blood group, Rhesus factor, total number of blood transfusion cycles received, vital signs record sheet to check vital signs, digital thermometer, watch, ISOMED stethoscope, sphygmomanometer, and pulse oximeter. An Observational Scale of Behavioral Distress-Revised (OSBD-R) evaluates children experiencing anxiety when receiving medical care, using eight behaviors: crying, screaming, physical and verbal resistance, seeking parental help, requesting information, predicting pain, and flailing. Each behavior is scored 0-4 (0.5 for observed; 0 for absent). Scores range from <1 (no anxiety), 1.5-2 (mild), 2.5-3 (moderate), to 3.5-4 (severe), and Elliott et al. validated its reliability and validity [<xref rid=""REF8"" ref-type=""bibr"">8</xref>]. The visual analog scale (VAS) for pain uses a horizontal line with emoji indicators to measure pain from 0 to 10. Scores are interpreted as 1-4 (mild pain), 5-6 (moderate pain), and 7-10 (severe pain), and Begum and Hossain validated its reliability and validity [<xref rid=""REF9"" ref-type=""bibr"">9</xref>]. Sample size The sample size was calculated based on a previous research study conducted by Dehghanmehr et al. [<xref rid=""REF10"" ref-type=""bibr"">10</xref>]. n = (SD<sup>2</sup><sub>C</sub> + SD<sup>2</sup><sub>E</sub>) × 7.8/(M<sub>C</sub> − M<sub>E</sub>)<sup>2</sup> = (1.40<sup>2</sup> + 0.63<sup>2</sup>) × 7.84/(2.18 − 0.70)<sup>2</sup> = (1.96 + 0.39) × 7.84/(1.48)<sup>2</sup> = 2.35 x 7.84/2.19 = 18.42/2.19 = 8.4 So, the minimum sample size is 9. Two groups of 60 kids were created using a systematic random sampling technique. For this study, three hospitals were selected using the lottery method. From each hospital, 20 children with thalassemia were chosen. Of these, 10 children were assigned to the foot reflexology group and 10 to the simple massage group, using systematic random sampling. According to the inclusion criteria, the first child was placed in the foot reflexology group and the second in the simple massage group. The foot reflexology group consists of 30 children, and the simple massage group consists of 30 children. Inclusion criteria include children with thalassemia aged 2-13 years who have come for blood transfusion. Exclusion criteria include children in critical condition who have complications other than thalassemia, undergoing anti-anxiety drug treatment, swelling, and unhealed wounds or cuts over their feet. Data collection After obtaining ethical clearance, prior authorization was acquired from the relevant authorities of Krishna Hospital and Medical Research Center, Karad, India; Padma Bhushan Vasantdada Patil Government Hospital, Sangli, India; and Government Medical College and Hospital, Miraj, India. The sampling was done using a systematic random sampling technique. The researcher introduced herself, established good rapport, explained the purpose of the study, received parents’ informed consent, and collected socioeconomic data of all participants. The researcher used OSBD-R to observe children’s behavior and the VAS for facial expressions (pain). Vital indicators, such as body temperature, heart rate, breathing rate, blood pressure (systolic and diastolic), and SPO2 levels, were recorded before interventions using a vital signs record sheet. Foot reflexology group children were positioned comfortably. The researcher washed hands and then administered a 20-minute foot reflexology (10 minutes per foot), focusing on the relaxation of specific points: foot, solar plexus, pituitary, heart, liver, and great surge point. In a simple massage group, the legs were warmed up. Using the palm and fingers of one hand, the ankle, sole, back of the foot, and toes were massaged for 20 minutes. Blood transfusion started, and the child was reassessed using OSBD-R, VAS, and vital signs post-transfusion. Data analysis involves data being compiled into a master sheet. Frequency and percentage were used to describe the demographic factors. Both paired and unpaired t-tests were used to compare mean scores. The chi-square test was used to evaluate the relationship between dependent variables and sociodemographic characteristics. Results were visually presented through tables and graphs. Confidentiality of the data about children and their parents was maintained throughout the informed consent process and interview. Frequency and distribution of demographic variables Table <xref rid=""TAB1"" ref-type=""table"">1</xref> shows that the majority (46.7%) of children undergoing foot reflexology were aged 2-5 years, predominantly male (73.3%), from rural areas (66.7%), and Hindu (90%). About 36.7% were from lower-middle socioeconomic backgrounds. Most were diagnosed by the age of 3 (93.3%), with 56.7% diagnosed in infancy. In all, 46% had parents with thalassemia minor. Rhesus factor was Rh+ve in 96%, and 40% had blood group O+ve. In the simple massage group, the majority of children (36.7%) fell within the 2-5 years and 10-13 years age brackets, with a notable male predominance (63.3%) and a significant rural residence (73.3%). Most identified with the Hindu religion (83.3%) and from lower-middle socioeconomic backgrounds (60%). Diagnosis occurred predominantly by the age of 3 (86.7%) and infancy (53.3%), with a high prevalence (63.33%) of parental thalassemia minor or consanguineous marriage. The vast majority were Rh+ve (93.33%), with blood groups O+ve, A+ve, and B+ve, each comprising 30% of the group. Comparison of mean scores of dependent variables in the foot reflexology group Table <xref rid=""TAB2"" ref-type=""table"">2</xref> shows the significant impact of foot reflexology on systolic and diastolic blood pressure (P < 0.05) and highly significant effects on anxiety and pain levels (P = 0.001). Anxiety levels increased from 4.03 (±0.80) to 3.2 (±0.84), and the level of pain significantly decreased from 2.46 (±0.57) to 1.76 (±0.67) after foot reflexology. Comparison of mean scores of dependent variables in simple massage group Table <xref rid=""TAB3"" ref-type=""table"">3</xref> shows that simple massage has a significant effect on temperature, anxiety, and pain (P < 0.05). The level of anxiety significantly decreased from 3.66 (±0.92) to 3.43 (±0.89), and the level of pain also significantly decreased from 2.26 (±0.63) to 2.1 (±0.66) after simple massage (P = 0.022). The mean before the simple massage was 98.32°F, and after the simple massage, it was 98.4°F, with a P-value of 0.025. Comparison of mean scores of foot reflexology and simple massage on vital signs, level of anxiety, and pain Table <xref rid=""TAB4"" ref-type=""table"">4</xref> reveals that foot reflexology and simple massage have a significant association (P < 0.05) with systolic blood pressure and pain. The level of pain significantly decreased in the foot reflexology group by 1.76 ± 0.67 than in the simple massage group mean by 2.1 ± 0.66 (P = 0.05), and systolic blood pressure significantly decreased in the foot reflexology group by 102.6 mmHg ± 8.6 than in the simple massage group by 107.6 mmHg ± 9.7 (P = 0.040).  Association of dependent variables before intervention with selected demographic variables Vital signs had no association with selected demographic variables. The level of anxiety had a highly significant (P = 0.001) association with age and a significant association with age of diagnosis in months and family history. The level of pain had a highly significant (P = 0.001) association with age and a significant association with age of diagnosis in months (Tables <xref rid=""TAB5"" ref-type=""table"">5</xref>, <xref rid=""TAB6"" ref-type=""table"">6</xref>). The study findings revealed that the majority of the children were male, predominantly Hindu, from rural areas, diagnosed during infancy, belonged to the lower-middle class, and had a rhesus factor of Rh+ve. Foot reflexology was shown to have a significant effect on both systolic and diastolic blood pressure and a highly significant effect on reducing anxiety and pain. Simple massage significantly affected temperature, anxiety, and pain. In comparison, after both interventions, foot reflexology had a more significant impact on the reduction of systolic blood pressure and pain than the simple massage. Simhachalam et al.’s (2018) study on 100 children with thalassemia found that 70% were male, 60% were Hindu, and 45% were from lower-middle-class families [<xref rid=""REF11"" ref-type=""bibr"">11</xref>]. The mean age of diagnosis was 2-19 months. Current study findings support the study conducted by Mansouri et al. (2018) on 60 children with thalassemia under 12 years, showing male predominance and diagnosis by the age of 2 [<xref rid=""REF4"" ref-type=""bibr"">4</xref>]. Systolic and diastolic blood pressure and anxiety scores significantly improved after foot reflexology (P = 0.0001 and 0.003, respectively) and non-specific massage (P = 0.003). The average anxiety level post-intervention was highly significant (P = 0.0001) [<xref rid=""REF4"" ref-type=""bibr"">4</xref>]. A similar finding was reported by Hussein (2022) on blood groups, and rhesus factors were significantly influenced in beta-thalassemia patients undergoing blood transfusions following both interventions. Blood type O was the most common (45%), and there was a significant decrease in Rh−ve samples among thalassemia patients (7%) compared to controls (15%). Rh+ve was 93% in thalassemia patients compared to 85% in controls [<xref rid=""REF12"" ref-type=""bibr"">12</xref>]. The study supports the findings of Ramadan Esmail Magor et al. (2023) that foot reflexology significantly reduces pain and anxiety (P < 0.001) in diabetic children during insulin injections [<xref rid=""REF13"" ref-type=""bibr"">13</xref>]. A similar finding was reported by Ghazavi et al. (2016), showing that foot reflexology significantly reduced systolic and diastolic blood pressure (P = 0.0001) and anxiety (P = 0.0001) in children with leukemia undergoing chemotherapy. In contrast, simple massage did not affect anxiety [<xref rid=""REF14"" ref-type=""bibr"">14</xref>], and a similar finding was reported by Jing et al. (2022). The mean systolic and diastolic blood pressures post-intervention differed significantly between the two groups (P < 0.0001 and p = 0.002, respectively). This indicates that foot reflexology helps reduce blood pressure [<xref rid=""REF15"" ref-type=""bibr"">15</xref>]. Limitations Children with thalassemia from ages 2-13 years were the only participants in the study. The sample size was limited to 60 children with thalassemia. The current study is limited to the effect of foot reflexology and simple massage on vital signs, level of anxiety, and level of pain. Strengths and future directions This study is non-invasive and affordable to lower-income families. For future research, we plan to conduct a study that includes wider age groups so that a spectrum of demographic parameters can be studied. In addition, the study would be planned before the IV cannula insertion among children with thalassemia. Implementation of non-pharmacological interventions like foot reflexology and simple massage in the care of children with thalassemia effectively reduces pain and anxiety during blood transfusions. Foot reflexology shows statistically significant benefit, positively affecting systolic blood pressure. Training nurses in these methods is crucial for providing comprehensive and compassionate care that addresses both the physical and emotional needs of these children.",N/A,26 8 2024
Clinico-Laboratory Profile of Hypertriglyceridemia Thalassemia Syndrome: A Case Series in a Paediatric Tertiary Care Centre,"Background: Increased hemolysis and repeated blood transfusion trigger oxidative stress resulting in numerous adverse effects in beta-thalassemia patients. Extreme elevation of triglyceride level is a rare clinical entity seen in these patients. It is presumed to be caused due to an increase in oxidative stress and is termed Hypertriglyceridemia Thalassemia Syndrome. Objectives: To assess the clinical and laboratory characteristics of beta-thalassemia patients presenting with hypertriglyceridemia and its correlation with the pre-transfusion hemoglobin level.  Methods: This hospital record-based retrospective study was conducted at the Dr B C Roy Post Graduate Institute of Paediatric Sciences, Kolkata, India. The study comprised 12 pediatric beta-thalassemia patients whose plasma appeared milky or chylous during a complete hemogram. Clinical examination and laboratory investigations were done to describe their clinico-laboratory features. A whole exome sequencing was carried out to assess their genetic background. Blood hemoglobin and serum triglyceride estimation was carried out initially and at follow-up to determine any correlation between the two.  Results: Out of 1482 patients, 12 (0.80 %) were diagnosed with Hypertriglyceridemia Thalassemia Syndrome. The median age of presentation was 12.5 months (Q1:10 months, Q3:14 months)., and the pretransfusion hemoglobin was 4.82 ± 1.16 g/dL. The lipid profile showed a triglyceride level of 858.3 ± 198.4 mg/dl and a total cholesterol level of 117.4 ± 16.15 mg/dl. Analysis revealed that the triglyceride levels were negatively correlated with the pretransfusion hemoglobin level (repeated measures correlation (rmcorr) = -0.65, 95% CI [-0.794, -0.425], p < 0.001). A genetic study highlighted c.92+5G>C as the commonest mutation. Conclusion: Hypertriglyceridemia was a rare presentation in transfusion-dependent beta-thalassemia patients. The serum triglyceride level significantly reduced when blood transfusion at regular intervals restored the patient's hemoglobin level.","Beta-thalassemia is a group of chronic hereditary hematological disorders characterized by abnormal beta-chain synthesis of hemoglobin, with phenotypic variations ranging from clinically asymptomatic to severe hemolytic anemia. It is present globally and highly prevalent in Southeast Asia, South China, the Middle East, and Mediterranean countries [<xref rid=""REF1"" ref-type=""bibr"">1</xref>]. Depending on the patient’s genetic analysis, β-thalassemia patients are classified into β-thalassemia major, β-thalassemia intermedia, or β-thalassemia Minor (carriers). β-thalassemia Major (BTM) patients require regular lifelong blood transfusion along with adequate iron chelation therapy, whereas β-thalassemia Intermedia (BTI) patients might require no or occasional blood transfusion [<xref rid=""REF2"" ref-type=""bibr"">2</xref>-<xref rid=""REF3"" ref-type=""bibr"">3</xref>]. In clinical practice, these patients are categorized into Transfusion-dependent-β-thalassemia (TDT) and Non-transfusion-dependent-β-thalassemia (NTDT) [<xref rid=""REF3"" ref-type=""bibr"">3</xref>].  Globally, many patients with BTM have limited access to regular and safe blood transfusions. In resource-constrained countries, fewer voluntary non-remunerated blood donors, poor public awareness, lack of national blood donation policy, and fragmented blood transfusion service create a significant gap between the timely supply and demand of safe blood [<xref rid=""REF4"" ref-type=""bibr"">4</xref>]. Regular blood transfusions are associated with multiple adverse effects like iron overload, transfusion-related infections, and transfusion reactions due to alloimmunization [<xref rid=""REF5"" ref-type=""bibr"">5</xref>]. Oxidative stress in these patients results in cytotoxicity and organ damage. The symptoms aggravated by oxidative stress include increased hemolysis, ineffective erythropoiesis, metabolic derangements, and functional failure of vital organs such as the heart and liver. The oxidative status of a beta-thalassemia patient depends on multiple factors such as genetic predisposition, nutrition, age, environment, variability of transfusion strategy, as well as the clinical condition <italic toggle=""yes"">viz.</italic> unpaired globin chains, severity of pre-transfusion anemia, and iron overload [<xref rid=""REF6"" ref-type=""bibr"">6</xref>]. Boudrahem-Addour et al. [<xref rid=""REF7"" ref-type=""bibr"">7</xref>] reported that increased oxidative stress (as estimated by malondialdehyde, reduced glutathione, and catalase activity) adversely affected lipid profiles in BTM patients. Different studies analysing the lipid profile in thalassemia patients highlight a lower serum total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, and HDL cholesterol level with a mild elevation in serum triglyceride level [<xref rid=""REF8"" ref-type=""bibr"">8</xref>-<xref rid=""REF9"" ref-type=""bibr"">9</xref>]. However, a very high triglyceride level is a rare phenomenon in thalassemia patients. This entity is known as Hypertriglyceridemia Thalassemia Syndrome (HTS) and has an unclear pathogenesis. It is particularly seen in pediatric thalassemia patients, and it is important to detect early for the prevention of complications [<xref rid=""REF10"" ref-type=""bibr"">10</xref>-<xref rid=""REF11"" ref-type=""bibr"">11</xref>]. As limited information exists on this pathology, this case series emphasises on describing the clinical and laboratory characteristics of patients with Hypertriglyceridemia Thalassemia Syndrome (HTS). Study setting and design This study was conducted at the Dr B C Roy Post Graduate Institute of Paediatric Sciences, Kolkata, India, a tertiary care paediatric center in eastern India. The data of beta-thalassemia patients admitted to the institute for blood transfusion from April 2021 to March 2024, was retrieved from the hospital records. The data was analysed over the next three months. This is a descriptive case series. Inclusion and exclusion criteria The diagnosis of thalassemia was confirmed by hemoglobin (Hb) high-pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC) test. Patients with transfusion-dependent thalassemia admitted to the thalassemia special clinic for routine packed red blood cells (PRBC) during the study duration were included. Undiagnosed cases of chronic hemolytic anaemia were excluded. Study procedure All transfusion-dependent beta-thalassemia patients attending the thalassemia special clinic were advised to get a complete hemogram as routine practice. During sample collection, when the blood was collected and allowed to stand for 30 minutes, it was observed that the plasma of a few patients was milky or chylous in appearance (Figure <xref rid=""FIG1"" ref-type=""fig"">1</xref>). These patients were suspected to have dyslipidemia. They underwent further investigations like liver function tests, renal function tests, lipid profile, and routine urine examinations. Serum ferritin was estimated for patients who had a history of over ten episodes of blood transfusion. The lipid profile of these patients was re-checked on subsequent hospital visits. The lipid profile of both parents of all these patients was evaluated to detect familial dyslipidemia. Denver II developmental screening test was used to screen developmental milestones in patients. The genetic background of these patients was conducted via multiplex amplification refractory mutation system-induced polymerase chain reaction (ARMS-PCR). Their lipid profile and complete hemogram were again evaluated at a follow-up visit after a period of one year, by which time the patient had received two to five episodes of regular transfusion. Statistical analysis Patient data was recorded in a pre-designed case record form and entered into an Excel spreadsheet (Microsoft Inc., Redmond, Washington, USA). Results of continuous variables were presented as mean ± standard deviation for parametric data and median with interquartile range for nonparametric data. Results from categorical variables were presented in frequency and percentage. Repeated Measures Correlation (rmcorr) was applied between serial measurements of pre-transfusion hemoglobin and serial triglyceride, as described by Marusich and Bakdash [<xref rid=""REF12"" ref-type=""bibr"">12</xref>]. Ethical approval The study was approved by the Institutional Ethics Committee (Memo No. BCH/ME/PR/427A dated 12.03.2024). It was conducted as per regulations mentioned in the Helsinki Declaration of 1964, as revised in 2013 and the local regulations. During our study duration 1482 beta-thalassemia patients attending the thalassemia special clinic were admitted for packed cell transfusion. Out of them only 14 (0.94 %) were found to have chylous or milky plasma. Of these 14 patients, two were diagnosed with familial hypertriglyceridemia, where either or both parents were found to have elevated triglyceride levels. The remaining 12 (0.80 %) patients were suspected of Hypertriglyceridemia Thalassemia Syndrome and were further analysed. These 12 patients included seven (58.3 %) male and five (41.7 %) female patients. The median age of presentation was 12.5 months (Q1:10 months, Q3:14 months). The pretransfusion hemoglobin was 4.82 ± 1.16 g/dL. Among these 12 patients, seven (58.3%) had hepatosplenomegaly, whereas four (33.3 %) had only splenomegaly. Three patients (25%) were clinically detected with jaundice on their first presentation. A delay in motor milestones was observed in three (25%) out of 12 patients. The clinical features and hematological parameters of these 12 patients are presented in Table <xref rid=""TAB1"" ref-type=""table"">1</xref>. Hemoglobin HPLC reports revealed that of these 12 patients, five (41.6%) had E-β-thalassemia while seven (58.4%) had β-thalassemia. The genetic profile highlighted that c.92+5G>C mutation was present in eight (66.7 %) patients, whereas c.79G>A mutation was present in five (41.7 %) patients. The other mutations detected in patients were c.92G>C and CD41/CD42(-CTTT) (Table <xref rid=""TAB1"" ref-type=""table"">1</xref>). Lipid profile analysis of these 12 patients revealed elevated serum triglyceride levels. However, their serum total cholesterol was within the normal reference range. The lipid profile showed a triglyceride level of 858.3 ± 198.4 mg/dl and a total cholesterol level of 117.4 ± 16.15 mg/dl. The total cholesterol and triglyceride of both parents were also normal (Table <xref rid=""TAB2"" ref-type=""table"">2</xref>). The serum urea and creatinine of all patients were within the normal reference range. The serum ferritin level of the patients (n=9) was 285.44 ± 127.26 ng/ml.  On analysing the serum triglyceride levels at the initial visit and at follow-up after two to five episodes of transfusion under supervision, we observed that the serum triglyceride level had a negative correlation with the pre-transfusion hemoglobin level (rmcorr = -0.65, 95% CI [-0.794, -0.425], p < 0.001) (Figure <xref rid=""FIG2"" ref-type=""fig"">2</xref>). At follow-up after one year, patients had normal serum amylase and lipase levels. No atherosclerotic changes were observed in the bilateral carotid intimal medial thickness of any patient. Patients with transfusion-dependent thalassemia often show many inevitable biophysical and biochemical changes, iron overload being a significant causative factor. Growth failure, hypersplenism, chronic hemolysis, impaired immunity, hypothyroidism, hypoparathyroidism, hypogonadism, delayed puberty, osteopenia, impaired glucose tolerance, propensity for cardiomyopathies, cerebrovascular accidents, and liver failure are all part of diverse organ and metabolic disorders [<xref rid=""REF13"" ref-type=""bibr"">13</xref>]. The unusual alliance of hypertriglyceridemia and thalassemia is described as a rare entity, according to some authors, and is given the categorical nomenclature “hypertriglyceridemia thalassemia syndrome"" [<xref rid=""REF10"" ref-type=""bibr"">10</xref>]. Hypertriglyceridemia implies a rise in plasma fasting triglyceride (TG) levels above the 95th percentile as per age and sex. For children of age groups 0 to 9 years and 10 to 19 years, a fasting serum TG concentration ≥ 100 mg/dL (1.13 mmol/L) and a concentration ≥ 130 mg/dL (1.47 mmol/L) are considered above the 95th percentile, respectively, labelling them to be hypertriglyceridemia [<xref rid=""REF14"" ref-type=""bibr"">14</xref>]. The Endocrine Society Clinical Practice Guidelines published in 2010 and the European Society Consensus Panel in 2012 opined a cut-off of more than 150 mg/dL to be hypertriglyceridemia [<xref rid=""REF15"" ref-type=""bibr"">15</xref>-<xref rid=""REF16"" ref-type=""bibr"">16</xref>]. Frederickson and Levy classified primary dyslipidemia on the basis of lipoprotein levels into five major groups. Among them, groups I, III, IV and V are associated with marked hypertriglyceridemia, although it is rare in the pediatric age group [<xref rid=""REF10"" ref-type=""bibr"">10</xref>]. Rao et al. [<xref rid=""REF17"" ref-type=""bibr"">17</xref>] first reported that hyperglycemia seen in thalassemia patients was not associated with familial dyslipidemia, tuberous xanthoma, tendon xanthoma or any other secondary risk factors. In this study, we observed a similar presentation in the 12 children adjudged to have hypertriglyceridemia thalassemia syndrome. In our study, the median age of presentation was 12.5 months. Khera et al. [<xref rid=""REF10"" ref-type=""bibr"">10</xref>] reported the age of presentation as four months to 2.5 years in their study. The pathogenesis of such an association is still obscure as the cases are sporadic, but a strong association with an underlying hemolytic crisis cannot be denied. In this study, the initial mean hemoglobin at the presentation was 4.82 ± 1.16 g/dL, which points towards a massive hemolytic state. A hemolytic crisis can serve as the origin of a pro-inflammatory cascade encompassing tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), interferon-α, and other cytokines, which, in conjunction with oxidative stress due to malnutrition, might elicit hypertriglyceridemia [<xref rid=""REF18"" ref-type=""bibr"">18</xref>]. Thalassemia patients are more prone to infections, and TNF-α reduces lipoprotein lipase activity in adipose tissue [<xref rid=""REF19"" ref-type=""bibr"">19</xref>]. Other cytokines also impair hepatic very low-density lipoprotein production in response to the infectious trigger, which might also contribute to hypertriglyceridemia [<xref rid=""REF20"" ref-type=""bibr"">20</xref>]. This early-onset hypertriglyceridemia can have a deleterious effect on the patient’s prognosis as it increases the risk of cardiovascular morbidity, acute pancreatitis, and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease [<xref rid=""REF10"" ref-type=""bibr"">10</xref>]. Serum triglyceride levels above 1000 mg/dL prompt a search for monogenic hypertriglyceridemia. In this study, the mean triglyceride level of 12 patients was 858.3 ± 198.4 mg/dL. Among the 12 patients, only three had serum triglyceride levels above 1000 mg/dL. However, whole exome sequencing excluded any monogenic background in them. This further confirms their diagnosis as cases of hypertriglyceridemia thalassemia syndrome. Previous studies reported that repeated blood transfusions of BTM patients under supervision at regular intervals, which led to hypertransfusion, decreased ineffective erythropoiesis, suppressing the cytokine cascade, which in turn ameliorated hypertriglyceridemia [<xref rid=""REF21"" ref-type=""bibr"">21</xref>]. Although niacin and omega-3 fatty acids are often used to lower serum triglyceride, there is a paucity of data regarding their dosage and safety in young children [<xref rid=""REF14"" ref-type=""bibr"">14</xref>]. In this study, we observed a negative correlation between triglyceride level and pre-transfusion hemoglobin level (Figure <xref rid=""FIG2"" ref-type=""fig"">2</xref>). We further observed that the serum triglyceride level of all 12 patients spontaneously reduced after two to five episodes of repeated transfusions at regular intervals (Figure <xref rid=""FIG2"" ref-type=""fig"">2</xref>). Subsequent follow-up of these patients at one year ruled out elevation in serum amylase or lipase and atherosclerotic changes in bilateral carotid arteries. In this study, we conducted whole-exome sequencing of the 12 patients to identify any genetic predisposition associated with hypertriglyceridemia. The most common mutation identified was c.92+5G>C, which is also found in the Mediterranean area [<xref rid=""REF15"" ref-type=""bibr"">15</xref>-<xref rid=""REF16"" ref-type=""bibr"">16</xref>]. To date, the correlation between the presence of a mild beta-thalassemia/severe beta-thalassemia genotype and a mild/severe clinical phenotype cannot be established due to the presence of a large number of genetic modifiers. Hence, individuals with the same β-thalassemia genotype may reflect wide phenotypic variability ranging from moderate to severe diseases with comorbidities [<xref rid=""REF10"" ref-type=""bibr"">10</xref>]. The main advantage of this study is that it tried to explore the clinical features, laboratory parameters and genetic predisposition of patients with Hypertriglyceridemia Thalassemia Syndrome. The main limitation is its small sample size. Multi-centric research on this area with a larger sample size can help to know more about the genetic predisposition and frame a treatment strategy for this condition. Another limitation of our study was that we had restricted our analysis to samples that had chylous or milky appearing plasma. The prevalence of this syndrome might be a little higher if we analysed all samples. This case series should be of interest to paediatricians dealing with thalassemia patients. Hypertriglyceridemia Thalassemia Syndrome is a rare metabolic abnormality observed mainly in late infancy and early childhood where very high triglyceride levels are noted in poorly transfused thalassemia patients. This condition may be undiagnosed in low- and medium-income settings. Clinicians should suspect this condition if chylous or milky plasma is observed during routine phlebotomy to check the complete hemogram of thalassemia patients prior to transfusion. We observed that this elevated triglyceride level tends to normalize over time when the blood hemoglobin level is gradually restored by repeated transfusion at regular intervals under supervision. If undetected hypertriglyridemia may have adverse effects on the patient’s health in the long run.",N/A,27 8 2024
Evaluation of microstructural changes in the brain in transfusion dependent thalassemia patients with advanced magnetic resonance imaging techniques,,"Beta-thalassemia are a group of diseases characterized by ineffective erythropoiesis and microcytic anemia caused by abnormal beta-globin chain production. This disease spectrum ranges from mild forms such as thalassemia minor, which is characterized only by mild microcytic anemia, to severe forms such as thalassemia major, which requires regular blood transfusions and can lead to complications such as liver and heart failure, arrhythmias, and even death [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR1"">1</xref>, <xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR2"">2</xref>]. In the 1970s, only a third of individuals with thalassemia major could reach the age of 16, with many succumbing to chronic anemia and its complications. Subsequent improvements in lifespan were achieved through transfusions; however, patients then began to die from cardiac complications and arrhythmias due to accumulated iron. Now, with the use of potent chelators, we are able to manage cardiac complications, significantly increasing the life expectancy of individuals with thalassemia [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR3"">3</xref>]. Yet, as life expectancy has increased, the detection of cognitive and neurological problems associated with the disease in older age has gained importance [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR4"">4</xref>]. Accordingly, it is crucial to intervene prophylactically during childhood before the onset of cognitive complications predicted in later life in this congenital disease. One of the fundamental problems in individuals with thalassemia, especially more pronounced in the intermedia group, is hypercoagulability [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR5"">5</xref>]. These patients often undergo splenectomy at an early age, which leads to increased thrombocytosis. Moreover, the platelets in these patients are more prone to thrombosis as they circulate with hemolyzed erythrocytes in the blood. Elevated ferritin levels in the blood increase the risk of thrombosis in these patients, and iron chelation can reduce this risk [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR6"">6</xref>]. Studies have shown that patients with transfusion-dependent thalassemia (TDT) exhibit increased white matter lesions on T2-FLAIR images, a finding that is prominent in thalassemia intermedia (TI) patients and associated with splenectomy [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR7"">7</xref>]. Research in sickle cell anemia patients has revealed microstructural changes through diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) even when conventional MRI appears normal [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR8"">8</xref>]. Thus, in addition to conventional MRI sequences, diffusion-weighted imaging could provide additional insights into white matter damage in these patients. Determining the presence or absence of this risk of white matter lesions is important because preventing these lesions, along with the increased life expectancy, could help avoid the increased risk of dementia in these patients [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR9"">9</xref>]. If such a risk exists, treatment options to address the hypercoagulation in small vessels from childhood could become relevant [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR10"">10</xref>]. The first study by Russo and colleagues in Italy using DTI and tract based spatial statistics (TBSS) found no microstructural changes in the white matter of these patients [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR11"">11</xref>]. However, this study did not perform fixel-based analysis nor investigated the relationship between laboratory parameters and DTI parameters. Fixel-based analysis can reveal microstructural changes not visible through TBSS [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR12"">12</xref>]. Additionally, the relationship between thrombotic risk factors and diffusion parameters is crucial for preventing these risk factors. Our study aims to assess microstructural changes in patients with transfusion-dependent thalassemia using a multimodal diffusion-weighted imaging approach. This involves utilizing DTI parameters along with multi-shell diffusion kurtosis imaging and fixel-based analysis. Additionally, we aim to understand the relationship between thrombotic risk factors and microstructural changes in the brain. The design of the study was observational. Ethical approval for the study was obtained (Ondokuz Mayıs University Clinical Research and Ethics Committee: 2021/422). Before each examination, all subjects were fully informed and provided written informed consent. The STROBE (Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology) guidelines were adhered [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR13"">13</xref>].  In this study, microstructural changes in patients with thalassemia were investigated using advanced diffusion MRI techniques. Our findings reveal widespread increases in radial diffusivity in the white matter of thalassemia patients, along with more limited increases in axial and mean diffusivity, and for the first time, demonstrate a widespread decrease in fiber cross section along with FDC, FC and FD in white matter fibers. Our correlational tractography results have, for the first time, shown that the number of platelets (PLT) and the amount of ferritin in the blood are highly related to damage in fiber tracts in these patients. A study on asymptomatic individuals with sickle cell anemia found an increase in T2/FLAIR hyperintense asymptomatic white matter lesions consistent with increased silent cerebral ischemia in patients with sickle cell anemia compared to normals. Even when conventional MRI images were normal, TBSS analysis found increases in RD and MD consistent with white matter damage in sickle cell anemia patients not detected by conventional MRI [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR8"">8</xref>]. Knowing whether patients with TDT also have a risk of silent cerebral infarct is important for deciding whether to administer antithrombotic drugs [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR10"">10</xref>]. Conventional MRI studies in patients with TDT have found an increase in white matter lesions, and this risk has been calculated to be higher in splenectomized TI patients [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR5"">5</xref>, <xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR7"">7</xref>, <xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR22"">22</xref>, <xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR23"">23</xref>]. Our study has shown increases in MD, RD, and AD in TDT patients, supporting white matter damage in these patients in a similar manner to previous studies. Studies have shown that in transfusion-dependent thalassemia patients, a ferritin level above 1000 ng/dl increases the risk of thrombotic events by 1.86 times [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR24"">24</xref>]. A PLT count above 500,000/µl is also one of the most significant risk factors for thrombosis [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR24"">24</xref>]. However, the changes they cause in the brain have not been quantitatively correlated. Our study is the first to show a positive correlation between the PLT count and MD, RD, AD values in white matter fibers. Additionally, ferritin showed and a positive correlation with MD in more limited areas, and a more widespread positive correlation with AD. All these findings indicate that the increase in ferritin and PLT is related to damage in the white matter of thalassemia patients. Changes in TBSS with DTI parameters in TDT patients have, to our knowledge, only been investigated by Russo and colleagues, but no significant differences in DTI parameters were found [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR11"">11</xref>]. Although these findings completely contradict ours, it is unknown how many of the TDT patients in that study had thalassemia major (TM) versus TI. 86% of the TDT patients in our study have TI. It is known that TI patients carry a 4.5 times higher risk of thrombotic events than TM patients. Furthermore, while 54.5% of the transfusion-dependent thalassemia patients in Russo and colleagues' study were splenectomized, 92.8% in our study were splenectomized. Being splenectomized increases the risk of thrombosis by 6.59 times in thalassemia patients. The difference in the rate of splenectomized patients and the proportion of TI patients may explain the differences in study findings. Future multicenter studies that separately evaluate TI and TM patients could clarify these differences. In a recent study by Zacarías et al., which included patients with thalassemia, a significant decrease in FA, particularly in the frontoparietal regions, was demonstrated in a group of patients with chronic anemia. This reduction in FA was also associated with decreased structural connectivity [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR25"">25</xref>]. Another study revealed that anemia alone is associated with cognitive impairment [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR26"">26</xref>]. This indicates that white matter damage in thalassemia patients is not solely related to thrombotic events, but that existing anemia itself also induces white matter damage. Indeed, our study found a widespread negative correlation between RD, MD and hemoglobin in the white matter tracts of thalassemia patient. All these findings suggest that there are multiple risk factors that could affect the white matter in patients with thalassemia. In the animal study conducted by Song and colleagues, an increase in RD began during the days when myelin loss was initiated in ischemic optic nerves, and a relationship was found between myelin damage and RD [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR27"">27</xref>]. Microvascular damage is associated with myelin loss, and the widespread increase in RD observed in patients with thalassemia may be related to RD damage linked to thrombosis. Indeed, in correlational tractography, RD is highly related to PLT, another indicator of thrombosis. AD is affected both by axons and myelin [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR27"">27</xref>]. While axonal damage reduces AD, myelin damage leads to an increase in AD. In fact, fixel-based analysis detected a reduction in density and diameter in areas that showed an increase in RD but not in AD, which might explain why some fibers, such as the corona radiata and corpus callosum, exhibit increased RD without a corresponding increase in AD. Moreover, the absence of changes in FC, FD and FDC in bilateral superior longitudinal fasciculus (SLF), corpus callosum areas where both AD and RD increase could support the presence of pure myelin damage and the secondary increase in AD. TBSS is inadequate in analyzing the cumulative effect of multiple different fiber populations within voxels. Fixel-based analysis has been developed in recent years to overcome this, and studies have shown that microstructural changes not detected by DTI or TBSS can be revealed by fixel-based analysis. While TBSS shows disease-related changes in white matter areas, especially in the centrum semiovale plane, reductions in FDC and FC in white matter fibers in the corona radiata plane and cerebellum can be shown with fixel-based analysis. A PET-CT study in thalassemia patients has shown decreased FDG uptake in left temporal and parietal white matter areas not seen in conventional MRI, aligning with our findings of decreased FC in bilateral parietal and left temporal white matter [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR28"">28</xref>]. DKI is an imaging technique that measures the non-Gaussian distribution of water diffusion in tissues, and is associated with tissue heterogeneity. Complex structures such as axons, dendrites, and myelin can increase the mean kurtosis (MK) value [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR29"">29</xref>, <xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR30"">30</xref>]. In the context of stroke, an increase in MK is also observed [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR30"">30</xref>]. In patients with thalassemia, myelin and axonal damage secondary to thrombosis can lead to a decrease in MK, while chronic microthrombotic cellular damage might contribute to an increase in MK. This complex situation might explain why, in thalassemia patients, there is an increase in mean diffusivity (MD) without a corresponding increase in MK. Such dynamics underscore the intricate relationship between tissue architecture disruption and diffusion imaging metrics, revealing the nuanced impact of pathological processes on imaging signatures. With the increase in the expected lifespan of thalassemia patients, preventing silent cerebral ischemias that can cause cognitive decline in later life has become important. A study in Iran showed that regular use of acetylsalicylic acid slowed the formation of white matter damage [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR10"">10</xref>]. It is also recommended that patients at risk be followed up every three years with conventional MRI sequences [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR31"">31</xref>, <xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR32"">32</xref>]. Our findings also suggest widespread white matter damage in these patients, likely related to PLT and possibly thrombosis. Therefore, using antithrombotic drugs in patients at risk and monitoring these patients with diffusion-weighted imaging in addition to conventional MRI sequences may prevent future cognitive decline. Our study has various limitations. It is a single-center study, and the longitudinal course of this white matter damage was not evaluated. Since cognitive functions were not assessed, the findings could not be related to cognitive impairment. Thalassemia affects multiple systems and involves multi-organ involvement. The changes in the brain could be secondary to the systemic organ involvement of the disease, but evaluating this requires extensive longitudinal studies. Our patient cohort is not sufficiently large to generalize the results, necessitating further studies with a broader scope to validate these findings. Although our patient group consists largely of thalassemia intermedia patients, it is heterogeneous. The courses of thalassemia intermedia and major are different, necessitating studies that evaluate these diseases separately. In conclusion, there is widespread white matter damage in transfusion-dependent thalassemia patients. This damage has caused disruptions in diffusion tensor parameters as well as in the density of white matter fibers and fiber cross section. The alterations in diffusion tensor parameters are related to increases in platelet and ferritin levels. Our results indicate that these patients should be carefully monitored for silent brain damage, and preventive treatments should be considered.",N/A,8 7 2024
Case report: A rare heterozygous Hb CS with heterozygous HbE in a family with thalassemia in China,"Thalassemia is a hemoglobin disease characterized by reduced or complete absence of the production of the α/β globin gene. Currently, the detection of β-thalassemia carriers is based on differences in blood cell parameters. However, β-thalassemia carriers cannot be distinguished from α- and β-thalassemia co-inherited carriers based solely on hematological findings, and the differential diagnosis must rely on molecular diagnosis. We report a 32-year-old male from Yunnan Province, who had abnormal hemoglobin E without obvious anemia. A rare α<sup>CS</sup> (CD142, TAA→CAA) combined with a βE (CD26, GAG→AAG) double heterozygous mutation was identified in the proband by PCR-reverse dot blot (PCR-RDB) and DNA sequencing. Additionally, a family lineage analysis was performed. This study complements the spectrum of rare thalassemia gene variants and is critical for clinical genetic counseling.","Thalassemia is a form of hemolytic anemia that is caused by the deletion or mutation of the globin gene, leading to impaired globin chain synthesis. It is a genetic disease that poses serious threats to human health. Thalassemia is prevalent in Southeast Asia, the Middle East, the Mediterranean, Africa and the Indian subcontinent, with marked ethnic and geographic differences [<xref rid=""bib1"" ref-type=""bibr"">1</xref>]. Thalassemia is highly prevalent in South China, such as Yunnan, Guangdong, Guizhou, Guangxi and Sichuan [<xref rid=""bib2"" ref-type=""bibr"">2</xref>,<xref rid=""bib3"" ref-type=""bibr"">3</xref>]. Clinical diagnosis of thalassemia mainly includes hematological screening and genetic testing. Hematological screening primarily includes routine blood tests, hemoglobin electrophoresis, and red blood cell osmotic fragility tests. Genetic diagnosis is typically used for the detection of common hotspot deletions or mutation types of thalassemia gene defects in China [<xref rid=""bib4"" ref-type=""bibr"">4</xref>]. Currently, thalassemia gene test kits can detect the 23 most prevalent thalassemia variants in China, encompassing 3 deletional α-thalassemia variants, 3 non-deletional α-thalassemia variants, and 17 common β-thalassemia variants. Among them, α<sup>CS</sup> combined with a βE double heterozygous mutation has been rarely reported in China, and its clinical characteristics require investigation. In this study, a case of Hb Constant Spring (Hb CS, HBA2: c.427, T > C) combined with a CD26 (HBB: c.79, G > A) double heterozygous mutation was detected, and family lineage was analyzed. The proband, a 32-year-old male from Yunnan Province, visited the department of neurology due to intermittent headache and dizziness in February 2023. The proband reported no obvious abnormalities in head MRI and CT, and denied having abnormal blood pressure and dyslipidemia. The doctor inquired about the medical history and learned that the proband was diagnosed with thalassemia in Yunnan; however, the specific examination was unknown. Physical examination: no pale lips, no yellow mucosa, no liver and spleen enlargement, no lymph node enlargement. Previous history: no history of blood transfusion, no history of iron therapy. Then, the proband was diagnosed as a thalassemia carrier of α<sup>CS</sup> (TAA→CAA) heterozygous mutation combined with a βE (GAG→AAG) heterozygous mutation through complete blood count (CBC), hemoglobin (Hb) analysis, and genetic analysis in our hospital. With no obvious anemia, the proband did not need treatment for the time being. Then, the proband was advised to go to the department of psychology. The doctor evaluated the proband's intermittent headache and dizziness as related to anxiety and depression, and treated him with Flupentixol-melitracen. In China, a database and literature search revealed that this genotype of the proband has rarely been reported. The parents of the proband are from Yunnan. The family members were investigated, and their CBC, Hb analysis, and genetic analysis were performed (<xref rid=""fig1"" ref-type=""fig"">Fig. 1</xref>A). CBC was detected with an automated hematology analyzer (Sysmex XN9100, Japan). The white blood cell (WBC) count, Hb level and platelet (PLT) count were normal for the proband (II1), father (I1), sister (II2), and daughter (III1). They showed decreased levels of mean corpuscular volume (MCV) and mean corpuscular hemoglobin (MCH) without obvious anemia. The mother (I2) of the proband had microcytic hypochromic anemia with decreased levels of MCV (79.1 fL), MCH (25.2 pg), and Hb (105 g/L). Capillary electrophoresis (CE) (Sebia Minicap-FP; Sebia, France) were used to detected Hb analysis of the peripheral blood samples. The mother (I2) and sister (II2) had normal HbA2 levels (normal range 1.5%–3.7 %), whereas the proband (II1), father (I1), and daughter (III1) had abnormal hemoglobin E (HbE), suggesting the possibility of thalassemia (<xref rid=""tbl1"" ref-type=""table"">Table 1</xref>; <xref rid=""fig1"" ref-type=""fig"">Fig. 1</xref>B–F).<fig id=""fig1""><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>Identification of the thalassemia genotype.

We extracted genomic DNA from 200 μL venous blood samples with the DNA extraction kit (Tianlong, China), and detected 3 deletional α-thalassemia variants (–α<sup>3.7</sup>, –α<sup>4.2</sup> and –<sup>SEA</sup>), 3 non-deletional α-thalassemia variants, (α<sup>CS</sup> (CD142, TAA→CAA), α<sup>QS</sup> (CD125, CTG→CCG), and α<sup>WS</sup> (CD122, CAC→CAG)), and 17 common β-thalassemia variants (CD17 (AAG→TAG), CD41-42 (-TTCT), CD71–72 (+A), IVS-Ⅱ-54 (C→T), IVS-Ⅰ-1 (G→T), −28 (A→G), βE (GAG→AAG), CD43 (GAG→TAG), −29 (A→G), CD27/28 (+C), CD14–15 (+G), IVS-Ⅰ-5 (G→C), CD31 (–C), −32 (C→A), −30 (T→C), 5′UTR: +40–43 (–AAAC), and Int (ATG→AGG)). According to the PCR-RDB assay, the proband's genotype had α<sup>CS</sup> (CD142, TAA→CAA) combined with a βE (CD26, GAG→AAG) double heterozygous mutation. The genotype of his father (I1) and daughter (III1) was characterized by a βE heterozygous mutation, whereas the genotype of his mother (I2) and sister (II2) featured an α<sup>CS</sup>α/αα heterozygous mutation (<xref rid=""fig1"" ref-type=""fig"">Fig. 1</xref>G). Hb analysis of the proband suggested the presence of a large number of HbE. To exclude the rare thalassemia mutations, DNA sequencing was performed by the ABI 3500 Genetic Analyzer (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA, USA) and analyzed by the Mutation Surveyor software (version 5.0.1). Sequence analysis (alignment to reference sequences NG_000006.1 and NG_000007.3) revealed heterozygous mutations c.427T > C in HBA2 and c.79G > A in HBB, which was consistent with the PCR-RDB analysis results (<xref rid=""fig1"" ref-type=""fig"">Fig. 1</xref>H and I). According to the defective globin chain, thalassemia is mainly divided into α- and β-thalassemia, caused by HBA1/2 and HBB gene mutations, respectively [<xref rid=""bib5"" ref-type=""bibr"">5</xref>]. The pathogenesis of thalassaemia is characterised by an imbalance in globin chain production, resulting in ineffective erythropoiesis, increased hemolysis, and disrupted iron homeostasis. Depending on the severity of anemia and the need for regular RBC transfusions, thalassemia can be divided into mild, intermediate, and major thalassemia. Mild thalassemia is caused by heterozygous mutations in a single thalassemia gene. Patients with mild thalassemia are clinically asymptomatic, with or without mild anemia. Individuals with major thalassemia usually require regular RBC transfusions. Intermediate thalassemia is less severe, and patients do not require transfusions or may receive sporadic transfusions [<xref rid=""bib6"" ref-type=""bibr"">6</xref>]. In this study, the father and daughter of the proband were β-thalassemia carriers, and the mother and sister of the proband were α-thalassemia carriers. Only the mother had slight microcytic hypochromic anemia. The incidence of thalassemia is high in Southeast Asia. Unlike hemoglobin sickle (HbS), the most common in Africa and the Mediterranean, HbE-producing β-thalassemia is dominant in Southeast Asia. This disease is mainly caused by the mutation of GAG to AAG at codon 26 of the β-globin gene, resulting in an amino acid change from glutamic acid (Glu) to lysine (Lys), activating cryptic splicing sites that regulate mRNA splicing of the β-globin gene. The activated cryptic splicing sites can compete with normal splicing sites and reduce the production of normally spliced mRNA, resulting in reduced β-globin gene synthesis and the production of variant mRNA. The latter can direct structurally abnormal, but functional HbE synthesis. Therefore, the clinical symptoms of βE carriers are mild. However, when βE is combined with other types of β-thalassemia, the clinical symptoms are different [<xref rid=""bib7"" ref-type=""bibr"">7</xref>,<xref rid=""bib8"" ref-type=""bibr"">8</xref>]. Additionally, the hematological results of single α-gene deficiency combined with β-thalassemia were similar to those of β-thalassemia, indicating that the usual single α-gene inactivation did not significantly effect the manifestations of β-thalassemia. It may be due to the improvement in the α/β-globin chain imbalance [<xref rid=""bib9"" ref-type=""bibr"">9</xref>]. The compound heterozygous Hb CS/Hb E genotype has been reported in Southeast Asia. In a study of 202 Thai individuals, the frequency of double heterozygotes for Hb E and Hb CS was 8.4 % (17/202) [<xref rid=""bib10"" ref-type=""bibr"">10</xref>]. Among the Có-Tu ethnic minority of Vietnam, the frequency of double heterozygotes for Hb E and Hb CS was 2.4 % (7/298) [<xref rid=""bib11"" ref-type=""bibr"">11</xref>]. Notably, the double heterozygous Hb CS/Hb E carriers were often misdiagnosed as pure Hb E carriers on routine Hb analysis because Hb CS was not identified. Thalassemia has significant ethnic and geographic differences. HbE is the most common β-globin gene mutation genotype in thalassemia patients in Yunnan, which is different from the other parts of China [<xref rid=""bib12"" ref-type=""bibr"">12</xref>]. A study has reported that among the 38,812 reproductive age couples, heterozygous Hb CS/Hb E genotypes were found in five cases in the Guangxi-Yunnan-Guizhou province, China [<xref rid=""bib13"" ref-type=""bibr"">13</xref>]. The frequency of double heterozygotes for Hb E and Hb CS is 0.0129 % (5/38812), which is very low and is only briefly mentioned in the epidemiological statistic without a detailed characterization of its clinical features. In this study, both the father and daughter of the proband carried a βE heterozygous mutation and had significantly increased HbE levels, but neither displayed an anemia phenotype. The proband had a rare heterozygous Hb CS with a heterozygous HbE genotype. CBC analysis showed that the proband had no obvious anemia. Hb analysis showed that the proband's HbE was the same as the father and daughter, with a simple heterozygous βE mutation, validating the peptide chain balance theory of thalassemia. This study helps to further understand the manifestations of thalassemia with α-gene heterozygous mutation combined with a β-gene heterozygous mutation. Thalassemia is an autosomal recessive disease, with normal clinical manifestations in thalassemia gene carriers. Yunnan is one of the provinces in China with a high prevalence of thalassaemia. The prevalence of thalassemia in Yunnan Province is complicated. Geographical location, ethnic distribution, population migration, and other factors impact gene frequency. A study has indicated that the frequency of thalassemia gene carriers in Yunnan was 10.71 %. Among them, the frequency of α-thalassemia gene carriers was 3.46 % and that of β-thalassemia gene carriers was 7.28 % [<xref rid=""bib12"" ref-type=""bibr"">12</xref>]. Although the gene carriers may not show obvious symptoms, they may pass on the disease gene to the next generation, thereby increasing the risk of thalassemia in the offspring. Consequently, the implementation of pre-pregnancy screening and prenatal diagnosis in high-risk couples who are both thalassemia carriers represents an efficacious strategy for the reduction of the risk of thalassaemia at birth [<xref rid=""bib14"" ref-type=""bibr"">14</xref>]. In addition, the proband in this study, originally from Yunnan, relocated to the north for work and residence. This case illustrates that the probability of detecting thalassemia in the northern regions has considerably increased because of changes in place of residence or intermarriage with individuals in the north. This study also suggests that the hematological parameters of β-thalassemia carriers cannot be distinguished from those of α-thalassemia and β-thalassemia co-carriers, and the differential diagnosis rely on gene analysis. Therefore, clinicians must consider the possibility of α-thalassemia combined with β-thalassemia heterozygous mutations in genetic counseling, even if the patient's hematological parameters are close to the normal range. This study has some limitations. For example, The proband sought medical treatment for intermittent headache and dizziness, not because of hematological symptoms. It was subsequently determined that the proband's symptoms were not related to thalassemia, and treatment details for the proband's initial symptoms were lacking. In addition, we failed to test the proband's wife triggering some flaws in the family pedigree. Genetic analysis and DNA sequencing were used to identify a rare heterozygous Hb CS with heterozygous HbE in a Chinese family with thalassemia. This study adds to the data on rare thalassemia genotypes and holds important implications for clinical genetic counseling.

</xref> Recognition of the correlates of the quality of life in patients with thalassemia has direct implications for the design and implementation of clinical interventions, counseling and support to improve the therapeutic outcomes and quality of life in these patients. In this study, the PRECEDE model was used to explore factors affecting the quality of life in patients with thalassemia major. This model was developed in 1970 by Lawrence Green et al. This comprehensive model provides for planning to empower people to actively engage in society to improve their quality of life.<xref rid=""hsr270075-bib-0011"" ref-type=""bibr"">

</xref> It involves four stages, including: (1) social diagnosis, (2) epidemiological diagnosis, behavioral and environmental diagnosis, (3) educational and ecological diagnosis (exploring enabling and reinforcing factors affecting the process of initiating and maintaining behavior change), (4) administrative and policy diagnosis. According to Green and Kreuter, behavioral factors, as determinants of a particular behavior, can be classified as predisposing, enabling, and reinforcing factors. Predisposing factors are predictors of behavior that include knowledge, attitudes, beliefs, values, perceptions, existing skills, and self‐efficacy. Enabling factors are predictors of behavioral and environmental changes, including accessibility, availability, rules, and policies. Reinforcing factors are factors that follow a behavior and provide ongoing rewards or motivations and include social support and important others.<xref rid=""hsr270075-bib-0012"" ref-type=""bibr"">

 Planning to improve the health state of patients requires sufficient information about the different dimensions of the patients' quality of life. It is possible to use the PRECEDE model to explore the individual, environmental and social factors affecting the quality of life of these patients. This model is flexible, measurable, and committed to the principle of participation and has a certain procedural structure. The PRECEDE model provides a framework by which predisposing factors (knowledge, attitudes, perceptions, beliefs, etc.), reinforcing factors (influence of others, family, peers, health workers, etc.) and enabling factors (availability of resources, skills, etc.) are determined as factors influencing behavior in educational decision‐making. In fact, the most useful application of this model is to explain the factors related to behavior. Thus, the present study aimed to explore the effect of an educational intervention based on the PRECEDE model on the quality of life of adults with thalassemia major. The following hypotheses were formulated:

  The minimum age of the participants in both groups was 18 years; their maximum age was 53 years in the intervention group and 40 years in the control. The mean and standard deviation of the participants' age was 26.92 ± 6.23 in the intervention group and 25.38 ± 5.14 in the control. Most participants in the study were female (56.4%), held a diploma and were unemployed (Table <xref rid=""hsr270075-tbl-0002"" ref-type=""table"">2</xref>). The information in Table <xref rid=""hsr270075-tbl-0002"" ref-type=""table"">2</xref> shows that before the intervention, there was no statistically significant difference between the two groups in terms of sex, marital status, and employment (<italic toggle=""yes"">p</italic> < 0.05). The findings summarized in Table <xref rid=""hsr270075-tbl-0003"" ref-type=""table"">3</xref> show a statistically significant difference between the mean scores of knowledge, attitude, self‐efficacy of enabling and reinforcing factors in the two groups before the educational intervention (<italic toggle=""yes"">p</italic> < 0.05). In terms of the total quality of life score, there was no statistically significant difference between the two groups before the intervention (<italic toggle=""yes"">p</italic> = 0.282). The results of pairwise comparisons by Wilcoxon test in the intervention group showed a significant increase in the mean scores of knowledge, attitude, self‐efficacy, enabling factors, reinforcing factors and overall quality of life before and after the intervention (<italic toggle=""yes"">p</italic> < 0.001). To compare the mean scores of the model constructs and the quality of life after controlling the effect of the pretest in the two research groups, analysis of covariance test was used. The results showed a statistically significant difference between the mean scores of the PRECDE model constructs and the quality of life after removing the pretest effect in the two groups. The mean scores of the model constructs and the quality of life in the intervention group were higher than the control. The highest estimated adjusted value was that of the reinforcing factors, explaining about 10% of variation in the quality of life as the dependent variable of (Table <xref rid=""hsr270075-tbl-0004"" ref-type=""table"">4</xref>). This study aimed to explore the effect of an educational intervention based on the PRECEDE model on improving the quality of life in adults with thalassemia major in Iran. The results showed that the educational intervention increased predisposing factors (knowledge, attitude, and self‐efficacy) in the intervention group compared to the control group.

<sup>32</sup>
</xref> the educational intervention could not increase the quality of life in patients with thalassemia and failed to positively affect the different dimensions of quality of life. These researchers attributed this lack of significance to the chronicity of thalassemia disease, the short duration of interventions, the multicausality of quality‐of‐life problems, the negative effect of the disease on different aspects of one's life, and long‐term and continuous interventions to check the effectiveness of interventions. Thus, one goal of care‐taking in these patients should be to improve their quality of life through continuous educational interventions using up‐to‐date educational methods (group discussion, Q&A, and educational videos). Among the limitations of the present study are: (1) failure to follow up subjects longer to check the consistency of the healthy behavior, (2) a mere focus on the PRECEDE model constructs, (3) the data were collected online and only literate people with internet access were able to participate in the study and the findings may be prone to selection bias, (4) there are more participants with university degrees and with very high SES in the experimental group versus the control group and this might have impacted the results. Thus, future researchers are recommended to develop qualitative studies to diagnose factors affecting the quality of life of these patients based on the PRECEDE model and also explore these factors using other health education theories or models. The present findings showed the effectiveness of the PRECEDE model to improve the quality of life in patients with thalassemia major. Effective educational interventions through the improvement of intermediary variables such as knowledge, attitudes and self‐efficacy lead to change and improvement in one or more aspects of self‐care behavior, including changes in lifestyle, self‐care in controlling risks and complications induced by the disease. Also, attention to self‐efficacy and its increase is an important predictor of adopting healthy behaviors by patients with thalassemia major. It is, thus, essential to implement the well‐developed educational programs and hold group training courses for this population of patients to change their lifestyle and empower them to promote health‐seeking behaviors. Considering the positive effectiveness of the PRECEDE model in improving the quality of life of patients with thalassemia major, the findings can be used to enrich theory‐based interventional strategies to develop and change health‐related behaviors.

Systematic literature review of the indirect costs and humanistic burden of β-thalassemia,,"Beta-thalassemia (β-thalassemia) is an inherited blood disorder characterized by anomalies in the synthesis of the β chains of hemoglobin. The pathophysiological hallmark of β-thalassemia is ineffective erythropoiesis, leading to anemia and abnormal iron metabolism. Severity ranges from clinically asymptomatic thalassemia to significant anemia requiring regular red blood cell (RBC) transfusions.<sup>
<xref rid=""bibr1-20406207241270872"" ref-type=""bibr"">1</xref>
</sup> β-thalassemia can be broadly categorized into transfusion-dependent thalassemia (TDT) and non-transfusion-dependent thalassemia (NTDT). Patients with TDT receive regular RBC transfusions to prevent the life-limiting consequences of severe anemia but experience the side effects of chronic transfusions, namely transfusion-associated infections and damage caused by iron overload to end organs (including the liver, heart, and endocrine glands).<sup><xref rid=""bibr1-20406207241270872"" ref-type=""bibr"">1</xref>,<xref rid=""bibr2-20406207241270872"" ref-type=""bibr"">2</xref></sup> Iron overload can lead to cardiac events, which are the primary cause of death in TDT patients in countries with insufficient monitoring and/or inadequate availability of iron chelation therapy (ICT).<sup>
<xref rid=""bibr3-20406207241270872"" ref-type=""bibr"">3</xref>
</sup> In NTDT, compensatory extramedullary erythropoiesis is common, leading to enlargement of the spleen, bone deformities, osteoporosis, and formation of erythropoietic masses in the spleen, liver, lymph nodes, chest, and spine. Treatment is aimed at symptom management. As hypersplenism may worsen anemia, splenectomy is common in NTDT and may lead to an increased risk of thrombotic events. ICT may be ultimately needed due to iron overload from increased gastrointestinal absorption of iron or from occasional transfusions.<sup>
<xref rid=""bibr1-20406207241270872"" ref-type=""bibr"">1</xref>
</sup> Significant progress has been made in the clinical care of patients with β-thalassemia, including treating patients earlier in the disease course, increased adherence to therapy, and improved management of iron overload and other complications.<sup><xref rid=""bibr4-20406207241270872"" ref-type=""bibr"">4</xref>,<xref rid=""bibr5-20406207241270872"" ref-type=""bibr"">5</xref></sup> As a result, many patients experience prolonged complication-free periods and longer survival.<sup><xref rid=""bibr6-20406207241270872"" ref-type=""bibr"">6</xref>,<xref rid=""bibr7-20406207241270872"" ref-type=""bibr"">7</xref></sup> However, this improvement in survival is accompanied by significant ongoing healthcare needs, specifically frequent blood transfusions and ICT used to manage iron overload. This can translate to a substantial impact on patient- and caregiver-related indirect burden of treatment and related complications, indirect costs related to hospital admissions, patients’ work productivity and absenteeism, and health-related quality of life (HRQoL).<sup><xref rid=""bibr8-20406207241270872"" ref-type=""bibr"">8</xref>,<xref rid=""bibr9-20406207241270872"" ref-type=""bibr"">9</xref></sup> Treatments that reduce disease severity through decreasing transfusion and ICT burden may help improve HRQoL and indirect costs. To obtain a clear understanding of the indirect burden associated with β-thalassemia, a systematic literature review (SLR) of studies on indirect costs and overall humanistic burden was conducted. This is the first SLR investigating indirect burden in all β-thalassemia populations. The SLR was conducted in accordance with the quality standards required by the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines<sup>
<xref rid=""bibr10-20406207241270872"" ref-type=""bibr"">10</xref>

</sup> The SLR was not registered. Electronic databases (Embase, MEDLINE and MEDLINE In-Process, and EconLit via Ovid SP) were systematically searched to identify suitable peer-reviewed records reporting on indirect costs and humanistic burden in β-thalassemia. The search was limited to records published from November 1, 2010 to November 25, 2020, in the English language, without geographical restriction. Search strategies included free-text and controlled vocabulary terms (<ext-link http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink href=""https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/suppl/10.1177/20406207241270872"" ext-link-type=""uri"">Supplemental Information 1 and 2</ext-link>). Gray literature searches included proceedings from recent meetings (January 2018 to March 2020) of the Academy of Managed Care Pharmacy, American Society of Clinical Oncology, American Society of Hematology, European Hematology Association, and International Society for Pharmacoeconomics and Outcomes Research (last accessed on January 28, 2019). Researchers also examined the bibliographies of systematic reviews and/or meta-analyses that reported on β-thalassemia and were published between January 2018 and November 2020 to identify additional relevant studies. The titles and abstracts from the searches were imported to EndNote X9 software (Clarivate, London, UK), and duplicates were removed. The search results were uploaded to Distiller Systematic Review software (Evidence Partners, Ottawa, ON, Canada), and the titles and abstracts were evaluated using predefined inclusion and exclusion criteria (<ext-link http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink href=""https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/suppl/10.1177/20406207241270872"" ext-link-type=""uri"">Supplemental Information 3</ext-link>). Full-text articles from the relevant abstracts that met these criteria were retrieved and examined. Title, abstract, and full-text screenings were conducted by two independent researchers, and any discrepancies were resolved by a third researcher. Extraction was performed by one researcher using an approved template and validated by a second researcher. Any discrepancies were resolved by a third, senior researcher. All costs were converted to United States dollars (USD or $) using conversion rates from August 2021 (<ext-link http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink href=""https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/suppl/10.1177/20406207241270872"" ext-link-type=""uri"">Supplemental Information 4</ext-link>). For costs not reported in USD, purchasing power parity (PPP) was calculated using the PPP Calculator (<ext-link http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink href=""https://pppcalculator.pro/"" ext-link-type=""uri"">https://pppcalculator.pro/</ext-link>) and used to assess the economic impact on the patient household as a percentage of per capita gross domestic product (GDP) (<ext-link http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink href=""https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/suppl/10.1177/20406207241270872"" ext-link-type=""uri"">Supplemental Information 4</ext-link>). In our analysis, we categorized all patients with transfusion dependency as having TDT, alongside those with β-thalassemia major undergoing regular blood transfusion. Patients categorized as having NTDT included those who were transfusion independent or those who had β-thalassemia intermedia. We also included a mixed group that included patients with TDT and NTDT who were regularly and intermittently transfused, and an unclear group composed of patients without a clear transfusion dependency status (<ext-link http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink href=""https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/suppl/10.1177/20406207241270872"" ext-link-type=""uri"">Supplemental Information 5</ext-link>). Indirect burden was defined as the economic cost endured due to work productivity loss, absenteeism/presenteeism, transportation cost and time burden due to scheduling medical/transfusion appointments, traveling for appointment(s) and work impairment. Time burden was reported in terms of the amount of time spent in a healthcare setting or with other activities to facilitate regular treatments. Indirect burden due to transfusion was reported as time lost due to treatments and other treatment-related indirect expenses.  To the best of our knowledge, this study is the first SLR on indirect burden among patients with β-thalassemia. Significant productivity loss, lost opportunities, and absenteeism were reported among TDT patients, with differences across geographies and age groups. Indirect burden was high across geographical regions. For example, families of patients with TDT put between 10% and 39% of their annual income toward indirect costs related to blood transfusions, follow-up appointments, hospitalizations, and other associated expenses.<sup><xref rid=""bibr12-20406207241270872"" ref-type=""bibr"">12</xref>,<xref rid=""bibr13-20406207241270872"" ref-type=""bibr"">13</xref></sup> This proportion of income is substantial even when put in the context of other chronic conditions such as diabetes (11%) and rheumatoid arthritis (22%).<sup>
<xref rid=""bibr56-20406207241270872"" ref-type=""bibr"">56</xref>
</sup> In addition, large productivity losses were reported, owing to the need for regular blood transfusions, disease complications, and distress caused by the disease. Based on our evidence, the cost of productivity losses was 6.38% of the total indirect costs, compared with 19% reported in a recent thalassemia study that did not fit the inclusion criteria of the SLR.<sup>
<xref rid=""bibr57-20406207241270872"" ref-type=""bibr"">57</xref>
</sup> These variations may be attributed to the heterogeneity in the populations included in the study and variation in study designs and methods used to estimate productivity losses. Additionally, costs should be viewed within the context of the economic wealth of a country; for example, productivity loss due to TDT represented 11.5% of Iran’s and 5.2% of Thailand’s GDP in 2015 (<ext-link http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink href=""https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/NY.GDP.PCAP.KD?locations=IR"" ext-link-type=""uri"">https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/NY.GDP.PCAP.KD?locations=IR</ext-link>).<sup><xref rid=""bibr18-20406207241270872"" ref-type=""bibr"">18</xref>,<xref rid=""bibr19-20406207241270872"" ref-type=""bibr"">19</xref></sup> Furthermore, PPP values show that the euro, Thai baht (THB), Indian rupee (INR), and Pakistani rupee (PKR) are, respectively, valued at 1.2, 2.8, 3.2, and 3.6 less than the USD, reflecting differences in wages, purchasing power, and economic development between the countries included in this analysis. The proportion of income spent on indirect costs per household (as a percentage of per capita GDP) in each of these countries further supports the economic impact of β-thalassemia on individuals and their families. Our results indicate a lack of published data quantifying indirect burden among NTDT patients. Given the impacts of NTDT on HRQoL, further discussed below, it is likely that a substantial indirect burden is experienced by these patients and their caregivers. There also remains a relative paucity of data on the effect of the indirect burden of TDT on families and caregivers, with one study reporting on lost opportunities<sup>
<xref rid=""bibr18-20406207241270872"" ref-type=""bibr"">18</xref>
</sup> and another on time lost due to absenteeism.<sup>
<xref rid=""bibr23-20406207241270872"" ref-type=""bibr"">23</xref>
</sup> Further research is required in both these areas to illustrate the full indirect burden of β-thalassemia. Most publications reported HRQoL data in the TDT population, with more limited data identified in the NTDT population. In a prospective observational study, baseline HRQoL scores for NTDT were worse than TDT scores for all domains, except Role-Physical on SF-36 and Physical Functioning, and across all domains of FACT-An.

However, the existing deficiencies in QoL, their worsening over time, and the apparent relationship with disease-related complications already speak to an unmet treatment need in these patients. SLR data suggest patients with TDT have increased susceptibility to anxiety and depression, with an association with reduced HRQoL.<sup>

Although limited, evidence found in the SLR on caregivers highlighted a substantial HRQoL burden. For example, caregivers of patients with TDT had significantly higher stress levels compared with the patients themselves.

</sup> Given the potential for improved therapeutic strategies and reduced transfusion burden to increase patient well-being, as well as the direct effect of patient clinical/therapeutic profile on caregiver HRQoL, better treatment options may also ameliorate the impact of thalassemia on caregivers. There are some limitations in our study. Few studies reported the methodology used in estimating productivity losses. The analysis of indirect costs of β-thalassemia relied on how cost data are reported in each study included in this SLR, which differed across the studies. Publications that reported indirect burden included data from various geographical locations with diverse health systems, costs of therapies, and patient backgrounds; therefore, a comparative analysis was not feasible. Many studies were from lower- and middle-income groups, thereby reducing the generalizability of the findings across broader β-thalassemia populations in high-income countries. Heterogeneity due to the inclusion of different study designs precluded formal study-quality assessment. The HRQoL scales used in the studies were mostly generic; therefore, this review may not give a complete understanding of the QoL of the condition or patients’ perception of their QoL. In addition, most studies presented findings based on a mixed population of adults and children. Finally, many of the publications in this SLR analyzed data collected from questionnaires and therefore may be limited by self- and proxy-reporting, and recall bias. In summary, the indirect burden of β-thalassemia on patients and caregivers constitutes a significant cost due to lost opportunities, productivity loss, and loss of welfare. There is a need for global observational studies focused on the indirect burden of TDT and, particularly, NTDT. The use of thalassemia-specific HRQoL measures will facilitate a better understanding of QoL for TDT and NTDT populations and patients’ perception of their own HRQoL. ",N/A,18 9 2024

In conclusion, the quantity of publications and citations indicates that β-thalassemia research has garnered significant scientific interest over the past decade. Notably, the University of Mahidol, Chiang Mai, and Milan have been the most productive institutions, making substantial contributions to the advancement of this field. Although Hemoglobin is the main journal for β-thalassemia research publications, Blood is the journal that receives the most co-citations, indicating the need for more high-quality studies in the area. The analysis of research hotspots highlights the importance of iron overload, anemia, gene mutations, and IE in the pathogenesis of β-thalassemia. Exploring the interactions between these mechanisms may provide valuable insights for future research endeavors. The application of gene editing therapy in the treatment of β-thalassemia has become an increasing concern, suggesting that this is an attractive field for further research.

Using Comfort Theory for Addressing the Psychosocial Needs of an Afghan Refugee Child with Thalassemia: A Case Report,"Psychological and social support is one of the factors that promote resilience in refugee children. Immigrant children with thalassemia have special psychosocial needs in the host country. The comfort model can help identify psychosocial needs. We applied Kolcaba’s comfort theory to an 8-year-old Afghan boy with a history of thalassemia in Iran. According to Kolcaba’s model, the taxonomy of psychological and social comfort needs were separation from mother, anxiety due to unfamiliarity with the hospital, fear of interaction and preference for silence, different culture and place of living, language barrier. To address his psychospiritual and sociocultural comfort care, we used coaching and comfort food interventions recommended by Kolcaba. The use of Kolcaba’s Comfort Theory was helpful in promoting the child’s emotional and social comfort in the case of an Afghan refugee child with thalassemia in Iran.","Iran is one of the countries with the largest number of people of Afghan origin individuals in the word, currently hosting nearly 3.6 million Afghans, with an additional influx of more than 1 million expected by 2021, and children making up about 40% of the new arrivals.<sup>

</sup> An 8-year-old boy of Hazara ethnicity, previously diagnosed with beta-thalassemia, fled Afghanistan with his father and siblings, seeking refuge in Iran. His mother was unable to join them due to immigration complications. He came to the hospital with his father and his main complaint was blood transfusion. He was admitted as an outpatient to the pediatric hematology unit for his first blood transfusion experience in Iran. The doctor took a medical history and physical examination. The management plan for addressing the child’s medical issues included blood sampling for hemoglobin testing, insertion of an appropriate intravenous line, blood transfusion, and monitoring for any associated complications. We assessed the child’s health status for care planning using the “Initial Pediatric Nursing Assessment Sheet.” This is a brief form developed by the Iranian Ministry of Health and used in all children’s hospitals in Iran for the initial assessment of children’s health needs by pediatric nurses. Observations and physical examinations, technical and attempted conversations with the child, and interviews with the father were used to make the assessment based on the tool. In accordance with this tool, the physical dimension was evaluated through health and medical history, physical examinations, medication history and allergies, assessment of limitations and abilities, nutritional status, and pain assessment. Within the psycho-social-spiritual dimensions, the assessment encompassed communication status, identification of high social risk factors, consideration for social worker involvement, and evaluation of religious and cultural values. The assessment revealed that the child was at high social risk due to beta-thalassemia, non-Iranian nationality, absence of his mother and communication difficulties. In addition, He struggled with effective communication in Persian, leading to a lack of meaningful interaction and cultural disparities with the Iranian context. Consequently, he appeared reserved, anxious, and apprehensive, particularly avoiding interactions with other children and nurses within the unit. To address the psychospiritual and sociocultural comfort needs of the child, we implemented coaching and comfort food for comfort interventions as guided by Kolcaba with the stage of nursing process (see <xref rid=""table1-2333794X241296415"" ref-type=""table"">Table 1</xref>).

These findings are consistent with those reported in several studies on thalassemia and immigration issues in children.<sup><xref rid=""bibr4-2333794X241296415"" ref-type=""bibr"">4</xref>,<xref rid=""bibr8-2333794X241296415"" ref-type=""bibr"">8</xref>,<xref rid=""bibr9-2333794X241296415"" ref-type=""bibr"">9</xref></sup> One of the strengths of the case was that, we were able to identify and classify the psychosocial needs into 3 levels of comfort: relief, ease, and transcendence. In fact, we gained a clear and practical perspective on how to provide comfort at each level, effectively addressing the psychosocial needs in this case. Although Kolcaba’s Comfort Theory assisted us in assessing the child’s psychosocial status, there is currently no specific tool for evaluating the psychosocial needs of immigrant children with chronic diseases. The tool we used only indicated that the child was at high social risk and did not offer any suggestions for interventions or care approaches. A study indicated that promoting psychosocial care for children requires addressing obstacles such as a shortage of specialists, inadequate tools for assessing psychosocial problems, and insufficient knowledge.<sup>

As part of the psychosocial care, our comfort interventions were tailored to respect the child’s cultural background and individual experiences, such as simply allowing him to wear his necklaces. Another intervention we implemented was to increase fathers’ awareness of the psychosocial support available for their children and to introduce social worker services. While parents play a crucial role in fostering their children’s psychosocial resilience during challenging times such as illness or migration, it is equally important that their own psychosocial needs are addressed by health services.<sup>

Upregulation of miR‑6747‑3p affects red blood cell lineage development and induces fetal hemoglobin expression by targeting BCL11A in β‑thalassemia,"In β-thalassemia, excessive α-globin chain impedes the normal development of red blood cells resulting in anemia. Numerous miRNAs, including miR-6747-3p, are aberrantly expressed in β-thalassemia major (β-TM), but there are no reports on the mechanism of miR-6747-3p in regulating red blood cell lineage development and fetal hemoglobin (HbF) expression. In the present study, RT-qPCR was utilized to confirm miR-6747-3p expression in patients with β-TM and the healthy controls. Electrotransfection was employed to introduce the miR-6747-3p mimic and inhibitor in both HUDEP-2 and K562 cells, and red blood cell lineage development was evaluated by CCK-8 assay, flow cytometry, Wright-Giemsa staining and Benzidine blue staining. B-cell lymphoma/leukemia 11A (BCL11A) was selected as a candidate target gene of miR-6747-3p for further validation through FISH assay, dual luciferase assay and Western blotting. The results indicated that miR-6747-3p expression was notably higher in patients with β-TM compared with healthy controls and was positively related to HbF levels. Functionally, miR-6747-3p overexpression resulted in the hindrance of cell proliferation, promotion of cell apoptosis, facilitation of cellular erythroid differentiation and γ-globin expression in HUDEP-2 and K562 cells. Mechanistically, miR-6747-3p could specifically bind to the 546–552 loci of BCL11A 3′-UTR and induce γ-globin expression. These data indicate that upregulation of miR-6747-3p affects red blood cell lineage development and induces HbF expression by targeting BCL11A in β-thalassemia, highlighting miR-6747-3p as a potential molecular target for β-thalassemia therapy.","β-thalassemia is a widespread recessive hereditary disease characterized by inadequate or ineffective composition of β-globin, anemia and ineffective erythropoiesis. It has been reported that 80–90 million individuals have β-thalassemia worldwide (<xref rid=""b1-mmr-31-1-13372"" ref-type=""bibr"">1</xref>). Due to severe hypoxia caused by anemia, patients with β-thalassemia major (β-TM) often have hepatosplenomegaly, growth retardation, jaundice, pale complexion and marrow expansion (<xref rid=""b2-mmr-31-1-13372"" ref-type=""bibr"">2</xref>). Current treatment strategies for β-thalassemia, including thalidomide, deferasirox, deferiprone, iron chelation, splenectomy, blood transfusion and hematopoietic stem cell transplantation still have numerous drawbacks including difficulty in donor matching and graft rejection in addition to a high cost (<xref rid=""b3-mmr-31-1-13372"" ref-type=""bibr"">3</xref>,<xref rid=""b4-mmr-31-1-13372"" ref-type=""bibr"">4</xref>). Novel treatment methods, including gene therapy and gene editing, have been previously investigated, and relevant clinical trials have shown improvements in anemia in patients with β-thalassemia (<xref rid=""b5-mmr-31-1-13372"" ref-type=""bibr"">5</xref>–<xref rid=""b8-mmr-31-1-13372"" ref-type=""bibr"">8</xref>). Furthermore, it has been demonstrated that the novel activin receptor ligand trap Luspatercept improves late-stage erythropoiesis (<xref rid=""b9-mmr-31-1-13372"" ref-type=""bibr"">9</xref>,<xref rid=""b10-mmr-31-1-13372"" ref-type=""bibr"">10</xref>). Despite the promising nature of these methods, there remain numerous safety concerns including off-target activity and chromosomal rearrangement events due to the small number of clinical trials conducted (<xref rid=""b11-mmr-31-1-13372"" ref-type=""bibr"">11</xref>,<xref rid=""b12-mmr-31-1-13372"" ref-type=""bibr"">12</xref>). Therefore, it is crucial to verify novel approaches for managing β-thalassemia. Human hemoglobin (Hb) undergoes two switches from the embryonic to the postnatal period, in which the main Hb changes from fetal hemoglobin (HbF; α<sub>2</sub>γ<sub>2</sub>) to adult hemoglobin (HbA; α<sub>2</sub>β<sub>2</sub>) (<xref rid=""b13-mmr-31-1-13372"" ref-type=""bibr"">13</xref>). This process is affected by several transcription factors, including B-cell lymphoma/leukemia 11A (BCL11A), activating transcription factor 4, Kruppel-like factor 1, v-myb avian myeloblastosis viral oncogene homolog, specificity protein 1 and Ly1 antibody reactive (<xref rid=""b14-mmr-31-1-13372"" ref-type=""bibr"">14</xref>–<xref rid=""b16-mmr-31-1-13372"" ref-type=""bibr"">16</xref>). However, the upstream regulators of BCL11A remain incompletely characterized (<xref rid=""b4-mmr-31-1-13372"" ref-type=""bibr"">4</xref>). Currently, a promising way to treat β-thalassemia is γ-globin reactivation, which elicits the point mutation of hereditary persistence of HbF in patients (<xref rid=""b17-mmr-31-1-13372"" ref-type=""bibr"">17</xref>). miRNAs are groups of non-coding RNA molecules and are essential for various biological functions such as cell differentiation, maturation and proliferation (<xref rid=""b18-mmr-31-1-13372"" ref-type=""bibr"">18</xref>,<xref rid=""b19-mmr-31-1-13372"" ref-type=""bibr"">19</xref>). Certain microRNAs, such as miR-32, influence early erythroid commitment; miR-22 and miR-28 have been shown to impact the maturation of erythroid cultures <italic toggle=""yes"">in vitro</italic> maturation (<xref rid=""b20-mmr-31-1-13372"" ref-type=""bibr"">20</xref>–<xref rid=""b22-mmr-31-1-13372"" ref-type=""bibr"">22</xref>). Normal erythropoiesis is characterized by a significant rise in miR-155, while the expression pattern of miR-339 is biphasic (<xref rid=""b23-mmr-31-1-13372"" ref-type=""bibr"">23</xref>). By changing the lifespan of globin chains, these miRNAs control the production of Hb, iron metabolism and resistance to oxidative stress in red blood cells (<xref rid=""b24-mmr-31-1-13372"" ref-type=""bibr"">24</xref>). miRNA sequence tests were conducted as in a previous study on the peripheral blood of patients with β-TM and the healthy controls to detect miRNAs with varying expression levels (<xref rid=""b23-mmr-31-1-13372"" ref-type=""bibr"">23</xref>). Out of the differently expressed 196 miRNAs, miR-6747-3p was identified as being notably increased (fold change, 4.76; P=0.001) and showing a positive association with HbF (<xref rid=""b25-mmr-31-1-13372"" ref-type=""bibr"">25</xref>). Current studies about miR-6747-3p have focused on the direction of endometriosis (<xref rid=""b26-mmr-31-1-13372"" ref-type=""bibr"">26</xref>), Alzheimer's disease (<xref rid=""b27-mmr-31-1-13372"" ref-type=""bibr"">27</xref>) and small cell lung cancer (SCLC) (<xref rid=""b28-mmr-31-1-13372"" ref-type=""bibr"">28</xref>). However, whether miR-6747-3p plays a role in hematologic diseases remains unclear. By conducting <italic toggle=""yes"">in vitro</italic> functional experiments, the present study aims to identify the expression of miR-6747-3p in patients with β-TM, in addition to seeking its regulatory impacts on red blood cell lineage development of erythroid precursor cells and γ-globin expression.   miRNAs are essential for controlling the expression of Hb as well as several biological processes, such as erythropoiesis and cell proliferation (<xref rid=""b40-mmr-31-1-13372"" ref-type=""bibr"">40</xref>). In the present study it was first demonstrated that β-TM had a markedly elevated expression level of miR-6747-3p. Based on correlation analysis, miR-6747-3p has a significant positive correlation with HbA<sub>2</sub> and HbF. Overexpression of hsa-miR-6747-3p impedes cell growth by causing cell cycle arrest, inducing cell apoptosis, accelerating erythroid differentiation and increasing HbF expression. In addition, it was shown that miR-6747-3p negatively controls BCL11A by binding to the 546–552 loci of BCL11A mRNA 3′-UTR. The aforementioned results indicated that miR-6747-3p may be an essential regulator of the HbF level via modulating BCL11A expression. Numerous researchers have explored the interaction between miRNA and HbF reactivation in β-thalassemia. For example, <italic toggle=""yes"">let-7/LIN28</italic>, miR-138 and miR-210 elevate γ-globin expression, whereas miR-223-3p, miR-150 and miR-146a suppress γ-globin production (<xref rid=""b41-mmr-31-1-13372"" ref-type=""bibr"">41</xref>–<xref rid=""b43-mmr-31-1-13372"" ref-type=""bibr"">43</xref>). Single nucleotide polymorphisms in miRNA target genes may also lead to abnormal Hb expression (<xref rid=""b44-mmr-31-1-13372"" ref-type=""bibr"">44</xref>). These findings imply that miRNAs may be valuable biomarkers for β-TM diagnosis and prognosis. miR-6747-3p expression was studied in several diseases. In patients with endometriosis, miR-6747-3p showed a good diagnostic capability for infertility combined with ultrasonography (<xref rid=""b26-mmr-31-1-13372"" ref-type=""bibr"">26</xref>). Another cohort study demonstrated a noteworthy correlation between miR-6747-3p and SCLC by targeting the colony-stimulating factor 3 receptor, a crucial component of cellular autophagy factor, which was highly associated with myeloid and lymphoid leukemias (<xref rid=""b45-mmr-31-1-13372"" ref-type=""bibr"">45</xref>). In a previous study, the research team identified upregulated miR-6747-3p expression in patients with β-TM by microRNA sequencing (<xref rid=""b25-mmr-31-1-13372"" ref-type=""bibr"">25</xref>). However, whether miR-6747-3p plays a role in β-thalassemia remains unknown. The present analysis of miR-6747-3p expression levels revealed higher levels in patients with β-TM (average age, 8.30±1.59 years) compared with healthy controls (average age, 9.00±2.23 years), aligning with previous findings (<xref rid=""b25-mmr-31-1-13372"" ref-type=""bibr"">25</xref>). Moreover, miR-6747-3p has a significant positive correlation with HbF. The effect of miR-6747-3p overexpression/knockdown on cell cycle, apoptosis, differentiation and proliferation were examined by CCK8, flow cytometry, Wright-Giemsa and benzidine staining tests. The results revealed that miR-6747-3p overexpression inhibited cell growth, accelerated apoptosis and stimulated cellular erythroid differentiation. Ineffective erythropoiesis, a prevalent condition in β-thalassemia, is characterized by high cell proliferation (<xref rid=""b46-mmr-31-1-13372"" ref-type=""bibr"">46</xref>). Prior research on miRNA variance examination in thalassemia indicated that the level of miRNA-101-3p was notably elevated in CD34<sup>+</sup> cells separated from peripheral blood of patients with thalassemia, with a more pronounced impact observed in individuals with thalassemia minor compared with major patients and healthy controls (<xref rid=""b47-mmr-31-1-13372"" ref-type=""bibr"">47</xref>). However, in the present results, the increased expression of miRNA-6747-3p inhibited cell proliferation, which was speculated to be related to the cell variance, and the present experimental group were all made up of patients with thalassemia major. Moreover, it is noteworthy that the change in 450 nm absorbance was more pronounced in K562 cells than in HUDEP-2 cells. The miR-6747-3p mimic group in K562 cells exhibited a notably increased apoptosis rate compared with the other three groups. The variable expression patterns of miRNAs and their capacity to modify physiological processes within cells may be a contributing factor to this phenomenon. Subsequent experiments with superior red lineage cells (CD34<sup>+</sup>) and relevant subgroups of patients with minor and intermediate thalassemia are required. By contrast, inhibition of miR-6747-3p was also shown to have an impact on erythroid precursor cells, perhaps reducing cell cycle arrest. This finding needs to be validated by other experiments involving cell cycle-related proteins. Furthermore, examining the morphological changes during erythroid differentiation showed that miR-6747-3p inhibitor cells had a greater number of basophilic erythroblasts and a lower number of orthochromatic erythroblasts compared with the control groups at the end of 14 days in HUDEP-2 cells. The multistep process of erythropoiesis involves committing multipotent HSCs to develop into the red blood cell lineage (<xref rid=""b34-mmr-31-1-13372"" ref-type=""bibr"">34</xref>). It is reasonable to infer that miR-6747-3p regulates the differentiation of erythroid precursor cells and ameliorates symptoms of anemia. K562 cells, first discovered in a patient with chronic myeloid leukemia, are frequently utilized as a laboratory model for studying the molecular processes in human globin gene expression and assessing the effectiveness of novel medications that promote differentiation (<xref rid=""b48-mmr-31-1-13372"" ref-type=""bibr"">48</xref>,<xref rid=""b49-mmr-31-1-13372"" ref-type=""bibr"">49</xref>). As first demonstrated by Rutherford <italic toggle=""yes"">et al</italic> (<xref rid=""b50-mmr-31-1-13372"" ref-type=""bibr"">50</xref>), K562 cells have a low potential for Hb-synthesizing but can undergo erythrocyte differentiation in response to various compounds, such as hemin. In the present study, benzidine blue staining results demonstrate that miR-6747-3p overexpression in K562 cells leads to an apparent increase proportion of benzidine-positive cells, whereas inhibiting miR-6747-3p leads to the opposite effect, suggesting that miR-6747-3p promotes Hb synthesis in K562 cells. In previous decades, efforts to increase HbF synthesis have been motivated by the concept that higher HbF diminishes the severity of β-thalassemia (<xref rid=""b38-mmr-31-1-13372"" ref-type=""bibr"">38</xref>,<xref rid=""b40-mmr-31-1-13372"" ref-type=""bibr"">40</xref>). Liu <italic toggle=""yes"">et al</italic> (<xref rid=""b38-mmr-31-1-13372"" ref-type=""bibr"">38</xref>) found that overexpression of miR-486-3p could notably decrease BCL11A protein and enhance the synthesis of γ-globin. Likewise, miR-210 boosts the synthesis of γ-globin by reducing the levels of BCL11A in erythroid progenitors derived from patients with β-thalassemia (<xref rid=""b40-mmr-31-1-13372"" ref-type=""bibr"">40</xref>). Furthermore, in K562 cells, miR-210 can enhance the suppression of BCL11A induced by mithramycin (<xref rid=""b51-mmr-31-1-13372"" ref-type=""bibr"">51</xref>). The BCL11A gene is mainly found in the brain and hematological organs, and it is situated on chromosome 2p16.1 (<xref rid=""b52-mmr-31-1-13372"" ref-type=""bibr"">52</xref>,<xref rid=""b53-mmr-31-1-13372"" ref-type=""bibr"">53</xref>). Research has indicated that BCL11A is essential for regulating the transition of Hb and preserving the inactivity of the γ-globin gene (<xref rid=""b54-mmr-31-1-13372"" ref-type=""bibr"">54</xref>,<xref rid=""b55-mmr-31-1-13372"" ref-type=""bibr"">55</xref>). An attempt has been made to reactivate HbF through BCL11A knockdown by synthesizing BCL11A short hairpin RNA that inserts into the flanking region of the miRNA precursor. <italic toggle=""yes"">In vitro</italic> research combined with <italic toggle=""yes"">in vivo</italic> mouse models have validated the shRNA-based treatment (<xref rid=""b56-mmr-31-1-13372"" ref-type=""bibr"">56</xref>). Based on the aforementioned research, β-thalassemia may be treated using miRNA-based targeted therapies (<xref rid=""b57-mmr-31-1-13372"" ref-type=""bibr"">57</xref>). In the present study, patients diagnosed with β-TM exhibited decreased levels of BCL11A mRNA expression. Moreover, the Pearson correlation test found that BCL11A levels were negatively correlated with miR-6747-3p and HbF. Therefore, it was hypothesized that hsa-miR-6747-3p may be involved in regulating HbF expression by targeting BCL11A. Through the application of bioinformatics methods, it was discovered that miR-6747-3p could bind to the 546–552 positions on the 3′-UTR of BCL11A mRNA. This finding was validated through fluorescence in situ hybridization. In HUDEP-2 cells, miR-6747-3p and BCL11A were discovered extensively distributed in the cytoplasm. Furthermore, the luciferase results indicated that miR-6747-3p could directly interact with the 546–552 region of the BCL11A mRNA 3′-UTR. Of note, miR-6747-3p was found to decrease BCL11A levels and increase γ-globin expression in HUDEP-2 and K562 cells, as shown by RT-qPCR and Western blot analyses. These results confirm that miR-6747-3p in β-TM could target BCL11A directly. Overall, the results of the present study indicated that miR-6747-3p has a specific clinical utility for β-TM. The statistical analysis revealed a notable molecular pathway that includes miR-6747-3p, BCL11A and γ-globin. Despite the small sample size recruited in the present study, this newly identified translational regulatory mechanism may offer a significant target for synthesizing HbF by mimicking miR-6747-3p functions. Notably, HbF levels can be influenced by drugs, autoimmune disease, pregnancy, malignancy, diabetes, genetic modifiers and hematological disorders and splenic dysfunction (<xref rid=""b44-mmr-31-1-13372"" ref-type=""bibr"">44</xref>). Several SNPs in BCL11A, such as rs4671393, rs4127407 and rs7606173, are associated with decreased HbF levels but can also lead to elevated HbF levels via microdeletion (<xref rid=""b37-mmr-31-1-13372"" ref-type=""bibr"">37</xref>). Previous research found no significant variations in hematological parameters between rs1426407, rs1018987 and rs11886868 (<xref rid=""b58-mmr-31-1-13372"" ref-type=""bibr"">58</xref>). However, 3.3% of HbF level variation in β°-thalassemia/HbE among Thai patients was found to be strongly correlated with rs6729815 (<xref rid=""b59-mmr-31-1-13372"" ref-type=""bibr"">59</xref>). Additionally, SNPs rs6545816 (A/C), rs6545817 (A/G), rs766432 (A/C) and rs6729815 (A/G) were linked with high HbF levels (<xref rid=""b59-mmr-31-1-13372"" ref-type=""bibr"">59</xref>). Given that mutations at the BCL11A locus can influence HbF expression, future research should implement more rigorous inclusion criteria.

","According to the statistical data from the World Health Organization (WHO), 5.2% of the population worldwide demonstrates abnormal hemoglobin genes, in which thalassemia is one of the more common hereditary hemoglobin diseases [<xref rid=""jcla25104-bib-0001"" ref-type=""bibr"">1</xref>]. Thalassemia has been shown to be distributed mainly in the Mediterranean coastal areas, Africa, the Middle East, Southeast Asia, and Southern China [<xref rid=""jcla25104-bib-0002"" ref-type=""bibr"">2</xref>]. Based on the abnormal structure of α‐chain or β‐chain globin, it was divided into α‐type and β‐type thalassemia. In China, thalassemia was commonly prevalent in the southern regions, such as Guangdong, Guangxi, Hainan, Sichuan, and Chongqing [<xref rid=""jcla25104-bib-0003"" ref-type=""bibr"">3</xref>]. Diagnosis of thalassemia required genetic testing, but prenatal screening was conducted through blood routine, hemoglobin electrophoresis, and other methods, which showed the most important auxiliary examination [<xref rid=""jcla25104-bib-0004"" ref-type=""bibr"">4</xref>]. In clinical laboratory, glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c, hemoglobin A1c) is one of the important ways to understand blood sugar levels. Glucose reacting with hemoglobin in red blood cells forms HbA1c [<xref rid=""jcla25104-bib-0005"" ref-type=""bibr"">5</xref>]. However, it was found that the detection of HbA1c is affected by many factors, including thalassemia, hemoglobin variants, iron deficiency anemia, hemolytic anemia, and kidney disease with further investigation [<xref rid=""jcla25104-bib-0006"" ref-type=""bibr"">6</xref>]. Reports indicate that hemoglobin variants are prone to causing abnormalities in HbA1c detection. The main reason was that the presence of Hemoglobin F (HbF) variants in thalassemia can interfere with borate affinity chromatography and high‐performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) at different levels in the detection of HbA1c [<xref rid=""jcla25104-bib-0007"" ref-type=""bibr"">7</xref>]. Due to differences in instrument detection principles and reagent methods, the detection of HbA1c may be affected differently, resulting in inaccurate HbA1c results. Previous investigation found high HbF level (≥ 1.5%) or abnormal Hb peak was companied with HbA1c testing, which may indicate the possibility of thalassemia. As we point out in Figure <xref rid=""jcla25104-supitem-0001"" ref-type=""supplementary-material"">S1</xref>, abnormal Hb peaks fall outside the conventional range (left, black circle), and a component was washed out later, indicating an abnormal Hb peak (right, blue circle). HbF is the main component of fetal Hb, accounting for about 55%–85% [<xref rid=""jcla25104-bib-0008"" ref-type=""bibr"">8</xref>]. It gradually decreases after 2–4 months, accounting for about 5% at 6 months, and has dropped to adult levels at 2 years old, accounting for about 2% of hemoglobin. In clinical laboratory, HbF results were present in the process of detecting HbA1c by using TOSOH HLC‐723G8 glycated hemoglobin analyzer, which uses ion exchange HPLC. Therefore, abnormal HbF level may indicate thalassemia, aplastic anemia, or juvenile chronic myelogenous leukemia [<xref rid=""jcla25104-bib-0009"" ref-type=""bibr"">9</xref>]. So, in the current investigation, we aimed to analyze the incidence of thalassemia in patients with abnormal HbF peak during HbA1c testing and to predict the influence factors affecting the occurrence of thalassemia in these patients.  A total of 126 patients endured high HbF level or abnormal Hb peak during HbA1c detection and were further examined for suspected thalassemia. Thalassemia mutations were detected in 66.7% of subjects, including 44 cases of α‐thalassemia (‐‐<sup>SEA</sup>/αα, ‐α<sup>3.7</sup>, ‐α<sup>4.2</sup>) and 37 cases of β‐thalassemia (17M, 41/42M, 654M, 27/28M). Further, three other heterozygosity mutations, including c.52A>T (p.K18*), c.‐78A>G, and c.126_129delCTTT(p.F42Lfs*19) present in the HBB gene, were identified by using sequencing (Figure <xref rid=""jcla25104-fig-0001"" ref-type=""fig"">1</xref>), which were predicted to influence the function of β hemoglobin (Figure <xref rid=""jcla25104-fig-0001"" ref-type=""fig"">1D</xref>). The variant causes a premature termination codon that is expected to be targeted by nonsense‐mediated mRNA decay and is reported in individuals with the relevant phenotype [<xref rid=""jcla25104-bib-0010"" ref-type=""bibr"">10</xref>, <xref rid=""jcla25104-bib-0011"" ref-type=""bibr"">11</xref>]. When analyzing the association between thalassemia and clinical characteristics, we found <sup>‐‐SEA</sup>/αα mutation demonstrated the youngest ages (Figure <xref rid=""jcla25104-fig-0002"" ref-type=""fig"">2A</xref>, <italic toggle=""yes"">p</italic> < 0.001).

No significant statistical difference was found with HbA1c level among different types of mutations (Figure <xref rid=""jcla25104-fig-0002"" ref-type=""fig"">2B</xref>). More interestingly, 17 M (Figure <xref rid=""jcla25104-fig-0002"" ref-type=""fig"">2C</xref>, <italic toggle=""yes"">p</italic> < 0.001) and 41‐42 M (Figure <xref rid=""jcla25104-fig-0002"" ref-type=""fig"">2C</xref>, <italic toggle=""yes"">p</italic> < 0.01) mutations with β‐thalassemia showed higher HbF levels compared with patients without thalassemia mutations.

Mutations in thalassemia showed lower levels of MCH (Figure <xref rid=""jcla25104-fig-0002"" ref-type=""fig"">2E</xref>) and MCV (Figure <xref rid=""jcla25104-fig-0002"" ref-type=""fig"">2F</xref>) compared with patients without thalassemia mutations. −α<sup>3.7</sup> (<italic toggle=""yes"">p</italic> < 0.001) and 41‐42M (<italic toggle=""yes"">p</italic> < 0.05) mutations demonstrated higher PDW levels compared with patients without thalassemia mutations (Figure <xref rid=""jcla25104-fig-0002"" ref-type=""fig"">2G</xref>). Except for −α<sup>3.7</sup>, other mutations in thalassemia showed higher levels of RBC (Figure <xref rid=""jcla25104-fig-0002"" ref-type=""fig"">2H</xref>). Comparing clinical characteristics and hematological parameters between patients with and without thalassemia mutations, except for the variables of sex (<italic toggle=""yes"">p</italic> = 0.787), HbA1c (<italic toggle=""yes"">p</italic> = 0.192) and HbF (<italic toggle=""yes"">p</italic> = 0.076), there were statistically significant differences in other variables (Table <xref rid=""jcla25104-tbl-0001"" ref-type=""table"">1</xref>). Patients with thalassemia mutations showed younger age (<italic toggle=""yes"">p</italic> < 0.001), lower Hb (<italic toggle=""yes"">p</italic> < 0.001), MCV and MCH levels (<italic toggle=""yes"">p</italic> < 0.001), higher RBC count (<italic toggle=""yes"">p</italic> < 0.001), and PDW level (<italic toggle=""yes"">p</italic> = 0.007) than patients without thalassemia mutations. In the current investigation, 66.7% of patients with high HbF levels (≥ 1.5%) or abnormal Hb peak in the process of HbA1c detection demonstrated thalassemia mutations. More importantly, patients with thalassemia mutations showed special characteristics of clinical phenotype and hematological performance. Therefore, which factors played the most important role in relation with the development of thalassemia need further analysis. To solve this question, we adopt three statistical models to explore the main factors. Firstly, univariate logistical regression analysis of all variables of clinical characteristics and hematological parameters showed sex, RBC, MCV, and HbF were independent risk factors for having thalassemia mutations (Table <xref rid=""jcla25104-tbl-0002"" ref-type=""table"">2</xref>). Based on univariate logistical regression, we conducted stepwise logistic regression analysis. All variables except PDW were risk factors for having thalassemia mutations (Figure <xref rid=""jcla25104-fig-0003"" ref-type=""fig"">3A–C</xref>, Table <xref rid=""jcla25104-tbl-0003"" ref-type=""table"">3</xref>). Thirdly, the random forest model shows that MCH, MCV and age are the three most valuable explanatory variables (Figure <xref rid=""jcla25104-fig-0003"" ref-type=""fig"">3D,E</xref>). In addition, ROC (receiver operating characteristic) curve analysis of the three models showed AUC of 0.929 (Figure <xref rid=""jcla25104-fig-0003"" ref-type=""fig"">3F</xref>, 95% CI [0.881–0.976], <italic toggle=""yes"">p</italic> < 0.001) with Random forest classification, AUC of 0.964 (Figure <xref rid=""jcla25104-fig-0004"" ref-type=""fig"">4</xref>, 95% CI [0.934–0.993], <italic toggle=""yes"">p</italic> < 0.001) with logistical regression, AUC of 0.963 (Figure <xref rid=""jcla25104-fig-0004"" ref-type=""fig"">4</xref>, 95% CI [0.933–0.992], <italic toggle=""yes"">p</italic> < 0.001) with stepwise regression, and AUC of 0.855 (Figure <xref rid=""jcla25104-fig-0004"" ref-type=""fig"">4</xref>, 95% CI [0.787–0.923], <italic toggle=""yes"">p</italic> < 0.001) with independent factor MCV. Therefore, the independent factor MCV is worthy of further consideration, because it appears in three statistical models and also demonstrated the most valuable independent factor in ROC curve analysis. Considering the high HbF levels and abnormal Hb peaks seen in HbA1c detecting, we conducted an in‐depth analysis of patients with such phenotype. In the current investigation, we found 66.7% of subjects had thalassemia mutations in the suspected population. More importantly, patients with thalassemia mutations showed younger age, lower Hb, MCV and MCH levels, higher RBC count, and PDW than patients without thalassemia mutations. Further analysis indicated the independent factor MCV demonstrated the most valuable diagnosis factor whether in three statistical models or in ROC curve analysis. TOSOH HLC‐723G8 glycated hemoglobin analyzer can not only accurately analyze hemoglobin (HbA1c) but also provide us with the accurate content value of HbF [<xref rid=""jcla25104-bib-0012"" ref-type=""bibr"">12</xref>]. Physiological increase of HbF commonly occurs in newborns or in women during pregnancy [<xref rid=""jcla25104-bib-0013"" ref-type=""bibr"">13</xref>]. But the main pathological clinical significance shows in several aspects. Firstly, in patients with β‐thalassemia, insufficient β‐globulin production leads to increase compensatory expression of δ and γ‐globulin genes, which in turn leads to increased levels of δ and γ‐globulin. Increased δ and γ‐globulin combine with α‐globulin to form HbA2 and HbF. Therefore, high levels of HbF are special indicators of β‐thalassemia [<xref rid=""jcla25104-bib-0014"" ref-type=""bibr"">14</xref>]. Secondly, the HbF content in patients with aplastic anemia is significantly increased [<xref rid=""jcla25104-bib-0015"" ref-type=""bibr"">15</xref>]. Thirdly, important laboratory feature of juvenile chronic myelogenous leukemia (JCML) is that HbF in peripheral blood increased for age, accounting for 20% to 80% of hemoglobin [<xref rid=""jcla25104-bib-0016"" ref-type=""bibr"">16</xref>]. This is the only condition where HbF is steadily increased. ROC curve analysis demonstrates AUC of 0.855 with independent factor Mean corpuscular volume (MCV) for predicting thalassemia in patients with high HbF levels or abnormal Hb peak [<xref rid=""jcla25104-bib-0017"" ref-type=""bibr"">17</xref>]. MCV refers to the average volume of a single blood cell, measured in femtoliters (fL). Elevated MCV is more commonly found in macrocytic anemia due to lack of folic acid and vitamin B12 [<xref rid=""jcla25104-bib-0018"" ref-type=""bibr"">18</xref>]. Decreased MCV is present usually in iron‐deficiency anemia, such as chronic gastrointestinal bleeding, hemorrhoid bleeding, or uterine fibroids, which are accompanied by excessive menstruation, gastrectomy, and other reasons [<xref rid=""jcla25104-bib-0019"" ref-type=""bibr"">19</xref>]. In the current investigation, MCV of less than 85 fL showed a valuable cut‐off for predicting thalassemia in patients with high HbF levels or abnormal Hb peak. Thalassemia, sideroblastic anemia, or other chronic diseases can cause low MCV values [<xref rid=""jcla25104-bib-0020"" ref-type=""bibr"">20</xref>]. However, it is worthy of note that in some cases of thalassemia, the MCV may be low even if the patient shows no iron deficiency. Reports have shown that the MCV value in mild β‐globin dysgenesis anemia is more significantly reduced than the value in iron deficiency anemia (IDA), which can be used as one of the screening indicators for mild β‐globin dysgenesis anemia [<xref rid=""jcla25104-bib-0021"" ref-type=""bibr"">21</xref>]. After clinical data analysis, MCV can not only be used for the early identification of refractory anemia and chronic aplastic anemia but also has a certain reference value for observing the efficacy [<xref rid=""jcla25104-bib-0022"" ref-type=""bibr"">22</xref>]. Continuous increases in MCV and red cell distribution width (RDW) indicate poor prognosis. Another study showed that pregnant women receiving HIV antiretroviral therapy, regardless of the presence of thalassemia, were associated with a substantial increase in MCV [<xref rid=""jcla25104-bib-0023"" ref-type=""bibr"">23</xref>]. If MCV < 80 fL was used as a cut‐off value, false negative results were observed in 2/3 of thalassemia carriers after 4 weeks of HIV antiviral therapy. Therefore, MCV screening tests should be used with caution in pregnant women receiving HIV antiviral therapy. Potential limitations should be noted. Sample estimates in statistical model came from a single center, which weakens the generalizability of the findings. Therefore, we hope to employ more data from multiple healthcare facilities or different regions in future investigations to confirm the findings. The current cross‐sectional study limits the ability to establish causality between high HbF levels or abnormal Hb peaks and thalassemia mutations. To confirm the findings, we need more molecular biological experiments to support the conclusions. Considering the cost of sequencing, we first detect candidate thalassemia‐related mutations by using SNaPshot SNP typing and AccuCopy technology, which may lead to some mutations. In conclusion, high HbF level (≥ 1.5%) or abnormal Hb peak present in HbA1c testing indicated high incident rate of thalassemia. Patients with thalassemia mutations showed special clinical characteristics. Therefore, more advice must be given for such patients to do further genetic testing. A routine blood examination of MCV is the most valuable independent predicting factor. Yafang Wan and Yu Zhang performed the sequencing, statistical analyses, and manuscript preparing.

Genetic Study for Identifying Beta Thalassemia Trait in Relatives of Children with Beta Thalassemia Major,"Background: The most common inherited illness, thalassemia, is thought to have a detrimental effect on public health, particularly in endemic areas. Children with beta thalassemia disease have several mutations. Prevention and premarital examination are still the most effective measures to lessen the burden of beta thalassemia. Objectives: This study primarily aimed to determine the beta thalassemia carriers in relatives of beta thalassemia major children, the role of gene study in the confirmation of beta thalassemia trait diagnosis, and to detect the genetic defect in the relatives of beta thalassemia major children. Materials and methods: The cross-sectional study was conducted on 109 healthy children, aged between six months and 18 years, who were the relatives (second and fourth degree) of beta thalassemia major cases. Results: Gene screening, using the amplification refractory mutation system (ARMS) polymerase chain reaction (PCR), covered the most common 22 alleles in the Mediterranean region, and was successful in detecting 61.5% of beta-globin chain mutations of studied participants, in addition to high prevalence (34.8%) of beta thalassemia carriers among the relatives of beta thalassemia children. Conclusion: The beta thalassemia carrier rate was found to be highly prevalent among relatives of beta thalassemia major children. Despite the accuracy of gene screening in the detection of beta thalassemia carriers, the use of the most common 22 alleles can only detect 61.5% of carriers; hence, the value of tested gene study is still limited in the detection of carrier rates.","Beta thalassemia major is a severe, life-limiting illness that profoundly impairs social and intellectual functioning. Due to doctor's appointments, hospital stays for monthly blood transfusions, and/or issue therapy, children frequently have to miss school. They are increasingly dependent on others and may have some psychological problems [<xref rid=""REF1"" ref-type=""bibr"">1</xref>]. The high prevalence of beta thalassemia carriers (34.9%) and the rise in newly diagnosed cases underscore the critical need for developing a preventive program for the disease in Egypt [<xref rid=""REF2"" ref-type=""bibr"">2</xref>]. People can discover more about their potential and present health, as well as the health of their progeny, through genetic disease screening. The most crucial actions to reduce the carrier rate of beta thalassemia are still preconceptions, orientation, and premarital testing [<xref rid=""REF3"" ref-type=""bibr"">3</xref>]. Primers-specific amplification, amplification refractory mutation system (ARMS), and reverse oligonucleotide hybridization with oligonucleotide probes are the two most widely used methods for detecting known mutations based on polymerase chain reaction (PCR). If focused mutation analysis is not successful in identifying the mutation, analysis of the beta-globin gene sequence can be utilized to identify unidentified mutations [<xref rid=""REF4"" ref-type=""bibr"">4</xref>]. Comprehensive national prevention programs that offer information on currently used tests for prenatal diagnosis, pre-implantation diagnosis, carrier screening, counseling, public awareness, and education have been established in a number of countries [<xref rid=""REF5"" ref-type=""bibr"">5</xref>]. Egypt lacks a national thalassemia prevention program, despite the country's high carrier incidence and growing annual number of new cases. Few studies have been done to find the thalassemia carrier rate in Egypt [<xref rid=""REF1"" ref-type=""bibr"">1</xref>]. One estimate puts the number of live births affected by thalassemia annually between 1,000 and 1.5 million [<xref rid=""REF6"" ref-type=""bibr"">6</xref>]. As of 2021, the disease is present in 5.3-9% of people in Egypt. A cross-sectional study on 2118 relatives of thalassemia patients from various Egyptian governorates in the Mid Delta region showed that 53.02% had microcytic hypochromic anemia [<xref rid=""REF7"" ref-type=""bibr"">7</xref>].  This study aimed to ascertain the frequency of beta thalassemia carriers among close relatives of beta thalassemia major patients, aged between six months and 18 years, determine how gene studies contribute to the confirmation of the beta thalassemia trait diagnosis, and detect the genetic defect in relatives of beta thalassemia major children. Study design and subjects This was a cross-sectional study conducted at the Assiut University Children's Hospital, Assiut, Egypt, from October 2019 to October 2021. The study was approved by the Ethics Committee of the Faculty of Medicine, Assiut University (approval number: 04-2023-10006). The trial was registered on <ext-link http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink href=""https://clinicaltrial.gov"" ext-link-type=""uri"">clinicaltrial.gov</ext-link> (NCT03822585). Inclusion and exclusion criteria Second or fourth-degree relatives of children with beta thalassemia, aged between six months and 18 years were included in the study. Relatives known to be thalassemic, who have received a blood transfusion, or had any other chronic illness were excluded from the study. Before the trial began, the guardians of all the participants provided written informed consent. Study process The flowchart of the study process is shown in Figure <xref rid=""FIG1"" ref-type=""fig"">1</xref>. Cases were numbered according to their attendance at the clinic, and then a relative for every fifth case was recruited. The STROBE (Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology) checklist and the Helsinki Declaration principles were followed during the study's execution [<xref rid=""REF8"" ref-type=""bibr"">8</xref>,<xref rid=""REF9"" ref-type=""bibr"">9</xref>]. Sample size calculation G*Power 3 software (Heinrich-Heine-Universität Düsseldorf, Düsseldorf, Germany) was used to calculate the sample size. To find an effect size of 0.5, a minimum calculated sample of 105 healthy children was required. According to the beta thalassemia carrier rate, with an error probability of 5% and 95% power, a total of 109 children were included. Technique Study participants had the following investigations in addition to a complete physical examination and recording of their history: complete blood counts, serum ferritin, C-reactive protein (CRP), and high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) were done on the D10 automated hemoglobin testing system (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Inc., Hercules, California, United States). The analytes were separated chromatographically using ion exchange HPLC. The D-10 automatically diluted the samples before injecting them into the analytical cartridge. Hemoglobin was separated in the cartridge according to its ionic interactions with the material by use of a programmed buffer gradient of increasing ionic strength that is delivered by the D-10. After being separated, the hemoglobin travels through the filter photometer's flow cell, where variations in absorbance at 415 nm are detected for those who showed microcytic hypochromic anemia, and a gene study for those who showed high or equivocal HbA2 The gene study was done by B-Globin Strip Assay Med (ViennaLab Diagnostics GmbH, Vienna, Austria). The B-globin strip assay, which uses biotinylated primers for polymerase chain reaction amplification and hybridizes the resulting products to a test strip containing allele-specific oligonucleotide probes immobilized as a series of parallel lines, is based on the principle of reverse hybridization. Twenty-two of the most common beta-globin mutations in the Mediterranean region are covered by the assay [<xref rid=""REF10"" ref-type=""bibr"">10</xref>], of which the ones detected in our study are shown in Table <xref rid=""TAB1"" ref-type=""table"">1</xref>. 
Statistical analysis IBM SPSS Statistics for Windows, Version 19.0 (Released 2010; IBM Corp., Armonk, New York, United States) [<xref rid=""REF11"" ref-type=""bibr"">11</xref>] was used for statistical analysis. The statistical significance tests were ANOVA/Kruskal-Wallis and Chi-square for comparison of differences in means, medians, and frequencies in different groups. P-values of less than 0.05 were regarded as statistically significant. The Youden index is a single statistic that captures the performance of a dichotomous diagnostic test (Youden index = sensitivity + specificity - 1). It was determined using the Medcale program for Windows version 19.4 [<xref rid=""REF12"" ref-type=""bibr"">12</xref>]. The biggest diagnostic cut-off point of the Youden index is used as the optimal cut-off value [<xref rid=""REF13"" ref-type=""bibr"">13</xref>]. To shed light on the sociodemographic findings of the groups under study, an exact test was used to assess the frequency difference between the groups. The laboratory parameters of the groups under study were clarified through pairwise comparisons using the post-hoc test and Bonferroni correction, while the Kruskal-Wallis test was employed to compare the median difference between the groups. A total of 109 relatives aged between six months and 18 years were included. Of these, 52 cases were positive for HbA2. Table <xref rid=""TAB2"" ref-type=""table"">2</xref> demonstrates the sociodemographic traits of these 52 children: 40.4% were males; most of them were from rural areas, with a P value of 0.0001. The history of consanguineous was significantly positive, with a P value of 0.006. Table <xref rid=""TAB3"" ref-type=""table"">3</xref> shows the laboratory parameters among the participants positive for <italic toggle=""yes"">HbA2</italic>, where the red blood cell (RBC) count was found to be higher in the beta thalassemia trait (BTT) group with low mean corpuscular hemoglobin (MCH), red cell distribution width (RDW)%, red cell distribution width index (RDWI), and Mentzer index (MI). Meanwhile, relationships between other parameters (hemoglobin (Hb), mean corpuscular volume (MCV), platelets (PLT), and WBC (white blood cell) were insignificant. Table <xref rid=""TAB4"" ref-type=""table"">4</xref> illustrates the HPLC and thalassemia gene expression of the studied groups. All 52 cases (of the 72 cases of microcytosis, 52 cases were positive or equivocal for HbA2, which suggested possible BTT) were further subjected to gene study (the ARMS of the most common 22 alleles in the Mediterranean region for detection of beta-globin chain mutation of thalassemia). The genes responsible for thalassemia were positive in 61.5% of participants in the study. Figure <xref rid=""FIG2"" ref-type=""fig"">2</xref> shows the frequency of genes in the studied cases. Molecular analysis was successful in determining 32 participants (out of 52 carriers based on HPLC), where 14 mutations were detected from 22 beta-globin mutations, which are frequently found in the Mediterranean region. Out of 14 different mutations, the IVS 1.6 (T>C) mutation was the most prevalent one (31.3%), followed by IVS 1.110 (G>A) (21.9%); a homozygous mutation was found in 16 patients (50%) out of 32, heterozygous in 12 patients (37.5%), and compound mutations in four patients (12.5%). Twenty patients (38.5%) showed unknown mutations. Our study's approach had a detection rate of 63.6% (14 of the 22 alleles examined). Figure <xref rid=""FIG3"" ref-type=""fig"">3</xref> shows the area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve (AUC) for gene mutations, the gene study's adjusted overall correlation (AUC) was 0.763, with 65% sensitivity, 92% specificity, 94% positive predictive value (PPV), 60% negative predictive value (NPV), and 75% overall accuracy, indicating that the gene study has a good confirmatory value for thalassemia screening. The high frequency of beta thalassemia carriers and the rising number of newly diagnosed ones highlight the importance of implementing Egypt's program for preventing beta thalassemia. Symptomatic thalassemia syndromes are a substantial public health issue in Egypt [<xref rid=""REF2"" ref-type=""bibr"">2</xref>]. Our estimated thalassemia trait prevalence in close relatives of patients is consistent with El-Beshlawy et al.'s study, in which a carrier rate of 9-10.2% was estimated among 1000 randomly selected normal people from various Egyptian geographic locations [<xref rid=""REF6"" ref-type=""bibr"">6</xref>]. The prevalence in the current study was also very comparable to that reported by Ahmed et al. in Rawalpindi, Pakistan (31%) [<xref rid=""REF14"" ref-type=""bibr"">14</xref>]. However, it was greater than the prevalence seen in extended family screening in India, as reported by Gorakshakar and Colah (21.9%) [<xref rid=""REF15"" ref-type=""bibr"">15</xref>], and lower than the results of the studies conducted in Faisalabad (44.4%) [<xref rid=""REF16"" ref-type=""bibr"">16</xref>], Kota, India (48.76%) [<xref rid=""REF17"" ref-type=""bibr"">17</xref>], Bandung (59.6%) [<xref rid=""REF18"" ref-type=""bibr"">18</xref>], Karachi (62.2%) [<xref rid=""REF19"" ref-type=""bibr"">19</xref>], Bhopal (76%) [<xref rid=""REF20"" ref-type=""bibr"">20</xref>], and North India (76.92%) [<xref rid=""REF21"" ref-type=""bibr"">21</xref>]. The disparity between these studies, findings could be attributed to the genetic heterogeneity of the thalassemia gene, variations in the overall prevalence rates in the pertinent geographic areas, the selection criteria (extended family or siblings alone, the number of participants, consanguineous marriage, and rural residence), and the studies' selection criteria. Our study results found a statistically significant difference between patients from rural and urban areas, with a significant increase in beta thalassemia carriers among those living in rural areas. Our results were also consistent with those of Maskoen et al., who conducted a study on 196 participants from close relatives of beta thalassemia major cases in Indonesia and reported that the presence of rural areas in governorates may be responsible for the notable differences between them [<xref rid=""REF18"" ref-type=""bibr"">18</xref>]. Regarding the laboratory data from the current study, carriers (children with the beta-thalassemia trait) had an extremely higher mean RBC count and serum ferritin level than non-carriers, and their mean levels of Hb, MCV, and MCH were lower. As regards gene screening, our study results found that in 61.5% of our participants, screening for beta thalassemia mutations using ARMS-PCR, which covered the most common 22 alleles in the Mediterranean region, was successful in detecting the beta-globin genotype, where we detected the presence of 14 b-globin mutations with a detection rate of 63.6% (as we covered 22 alleles only from > 200 alleles responsible for thalassemia mutation) where the most common mutation was IVS 1.6 (T>C) (31.3%), followed by IVS 1.110 (G>A) (21.9%), and then IVS 1.1 (G>A), and IVS 2.848 (C>A), both of them 9.4%, followed by the rarest gene mutations: IVS 2.745 (C>G), Codon 39, and Codon 8 (-AA) (6.3% each), and then all the remaining genes: -30 (T>A), -87 (C>G), Codon 5 (-CT), Codon 27 (G>t), IVS 2.1 (G>A), IVS 1.5 (T>C), and lastly codon 44 (-C) (3.1% each). Similar to our results, El-Gawhary revealed beta thalassemia mutation in 80 of the 95 cases from Fayoum; IVS I.6 (T>>C) was the most prevalent allele in the sample (36.3%) and IVS I.110 (G>>A) was the second-most frequent mutation (25.8%) [<xref rid=""REF22"" ref-type=""bibr"">22</xref>]. In a similar study, Hussein et al. used genomic PCR and a range of mutation-screening techniques to discover the spectrum of mutations that cause beta thalassemia in Egypt in which IVS 1.110 (41%), IVS 1.6, IVS 1.1, and IVS 2.848 (11%) were found as the four mutations that comprised 78% of the beta thalassemia genes [<xref rid=""REF23"" ref-type=""bibr"">23</xref>]. In another study by Hussein et al., IVS 1.110 (G>A) (31.4%) was the most prevalent mutation among patients from the Suez Canal area [<xref rid=""REF24"" ref-type=""bibr"">24</xref>]. The findings of Elmezayen et al., who examined 47 Egyptian patients in total, including 25 men and 22 women who had been diagnosed with thalassemia, to map the range of mutations that lead to beta thalassemia on the Egyptian north coast, were consistent with our findings in that they also identified 10 globin mutations; IVS 1.6 (T>C) (27.66%), and IVS 1.110 (G>A) (22.35%) were the most common. Twenty-four patients (51%) had homozygous mutations, while 13 patients (28%) had compound heterozygous mutations [<xref rid=""REF25"" ref-type=""bibr"">25</xref>]. In order to determine the range of mutations that cause beta thalassemia, El-Shanshory et al. examined 200 children with the disease in Egypt. using genomic PCR and several mutation-screening tools [<xref rid=""REF26"" ref-type=""bibr"">26</xref>]. They found that the mutations IVS 1.110 (G>A) (48%), IVS 1.6 (T>C) (40%), and IVS 1.1 (G>A) (24%, were the most common. According to Omar et al.'s study in Alexandria, which included 50 transfusion-dependent beta thalassemia cases, the most prevalent mutation was IVS 1.110, followed by IVS 1.6 and IVS 1.1. None of the patients in this study had the IVS 1.1 or Cd-39 mutations [<xref rid=""REF20"" ref-type=""bibr"">20</xref>]. Despite the novelty of gene studies in the confirmation of the diagnosis of thalassemia carriers, HPLC is still the gold standard in the diagnosis of thalassemia in Egyptian children. Limitations of the study This study was done on only 22 alleles suspected to be prevalent in our society but we recommend other researchers to use extended gene study for all known genes related to the occurrence of this disease or rapid exome sequencing in a consanguineous population [<xref rid=""REF27"" ref-type=""bibr"">27</xref>]. Also, this study was done on 109 children, and we recommend a larger sample size for a more accurate determination of the prevalence of carriers of this disease Beta thalassemia trait is significantly prevalent among relatives of thalassemia children, and the most prevalent mutation in these children was IVS 1.6 (T>C). In spite of the fact that HbA2 is still the gold standard and a more reliable test for the diagnosis of thalassemia, gene study plays a very important role in the confirmation of the diagnosis of equivocal cases and the detection of the genetic defect in such cases. An extended gene panel is needed for a proper diagnosis of cases and carriers of thalassemia and the identification of complete genetic defects in such cases.",N/A,26 9 2024
Impact of met-haemoglobin and oxidative stress on endothelial function in patients with transfusion dependent β-thalassemia,"Transfusion dependent β-thalassemia is a genetic blood disorder characterized by chronic anaemia. Blood transfusion is lifesaving but comes at a cost. Iron overload emerges as a prime culprit as a free radicals damage endothelial cells. Chronic anaemia further disrupts oxygen delivery, exacerbating the oxidative stress. Increased levels of met-haemoglobin and malondialdehyde compromise endothelial function. This research sheds light on the impact of met-haemoglobin and oxidative stress on endothelial function in 50 patients with transfusion dependent β-thalassemia major compared to 50 healthy individuals as control. Blood samples were collected & subjected to CBC, biochemical analysis including creatinine, ferritin, CRP, LDH, and HCV antibodies. Oxidative stress was assessed using met-haemoglobin & malondialdehyde. Endothelial dysfunction was evaluated by endothelial activation and stress index (EASIX). EASIX, met-haemoglobin and malondialdehyde were significantly increased in patients (1.44 ± 0.75, 2.07 ± 0.2, 4.8 ± 0.63; respectively) compared to the control (0.52 ± 0.24,0.88 ± 0.34,0.8 ± 0.34; respectively). Significant strong positive correlation was found between EASIX and met-haemoglobin, malondialdehyde, serum ferritin and CRP (<italic toggle=""yes"">P</italic> = 0.00, <italic toggle=""yes"">r</italic> = 0.904, <italic toggle=""yes"">P</italic> = 0.00, <italic toggle=""yes"">r</italic> = 0.948, <italic toggle=""yes"">P</italic> = 0.00, <italic toggle=""yes"">r</italic> = 0.772, <italic toggle=""yes"">P</italic> = 0.00, <italic toggle=""yes"">r</italic> = 0.971; respectively. Met-haemoglobin as well as EASIX should be routinely estimated to assess endothelial function especially before the decision of splenectomy. Antioxidant drugs should be supplemented.","β-thalassemia is a major monogenic disease with reduced or absent β globin genes<sup><xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR1"">1</xref></sup>. The unpaired α-globin gene results in chronic haemolysis and ineffective erythropoiesis necessitating lifelong blood transfusion. This exposes the patients to many complications namely; chronic anaemia, iron overload, oxidative stress, hypercoagulability and platelet activation in which damaged endothelial cells will be the end sequence<sup><xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR2"">2</xref>,<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR3"">3</xref></sup>. The normal endothelium serves as a critical regulator of vascular homeostasis, maintaining a delicate equilibrium between diverse physiological processes. These include vasomotor function (dilation and constriction), vascular smooth muscle cell growth and death, a balanced release of pro- and anti-inflammatory mediators, and the delicate interplay of oxidative stress and antioxidant defense<sup><xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR4"">4</xref></sup>. Chronic haemolysis in transfusion-dependent β-thalassemia (TDT) is a key driver of inflammation as red blood cells destruction releases inflammatory mediators that can lead to oxidative stress, immune system activation, and iron overload<sup><xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR5"">5</xref></sup>. A relationship between inflammatory biomarkers and thalassemia has been recently reported<sup><xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR6"">6</xref></sup>. Inflammation makes endothelium to undergo multiple functional modifications that are adaptive but become harmful when exceeding, leading to microvascular dysfunction and multiorgan failure<sup><xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR7"">7</xref></sup>. Moreover; the endothelial dysfunction is caused by the interplay of adhesion molecules and inflammatory cytokines such soluble intercellular adhesion molecule and E-selectin<sup><xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR8"">8</xref>,<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR9"">9</xref></sup>. Oxidative stress in TDT patients is caused mostly by excess non-transferrin bound iron, a powerful free radical that destroys organs, DNA and mitochondria. TDT patients are likely to have simultaneous intravascular haemolysis when subjected to oxidative stress which causes haemoglobin oxidation and the formation of met-haemoglobin (Met-Hb)<sup><xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR10"">10</xref>,<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR11"">11</xref></sup>. Moreover, chronic anaemia by itself can lead to increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) production as the body compensates for low oxygen level which directly damages endothelial cells threatening vasodilation by impairing nitric oxide (NO) bioavailability, a potent vasodilator and key regulator of endothelial function<sup><xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR12"">12</xref>,<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR13"">13</xref></sup>. ROS also trigger auto-oxidation of haemoglobin, accelerating the conversion of ferrous (Fe²⁺) to ferric (Fe³⁺) state within the haemoglobin molecule, resulting in excessive Met-Hb formation (more than 1%). Met-Hb is an abnormal form of haemoglobin that incapable of delivering oxygen to tissues as ferric iron cannot reversibly bind oxygen causing left shift in oxygen dissociation curve and eventual tissue hypoxia particularly in the vascular endothelium leading to endothelial dysfunction<sup><xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR14"">14</xref></sup>. Additionally, Met-Hb’s pro-oxidant properties can trigger oxidative stress causing structural and functional changes in the endothelium<sup><xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR15"">15</xref></sup>. These changes include increase oxidative damage to endothelial cells and impaired NO bioavailability<sup><xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR6"">6</xref></sup>, as Met-Hb scavenges it, which results in impaired vasodilation, decreased blood flow and ultimately endothelial dysfunction with upregulation of inflammatory markers and release of interleukin 1 beta, neutrophil activation and degranulation of Weibel-Palade bodies<sup><xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR16"">16</xref>,<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR17"">17</xref></sup>. Chronic blood transfusion in TDT exposes these patients to the effect of iron overload, which damages tissues and triggers an inflammatory response by generating the formation of ROS that directly oxidise haemoglobin, contributing to elevated Met-Hb levels. In the presence of chronic haemolysis, this causes oxidative damage to the endothelium and activation of inflammatory pathways. Chronic transfusion also exposes them to a bioactive product in blood bags resulting in pro-inflammatory status that in turn produces vascular inflammation and endothelial dysfunction<sup><xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR6"">6</xref>,<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR18"">18</xref></sup>. Increased platelet count in these patients can be considered as a marker of systemic inflammation which is a feature of endothelial dysfunction<sup><xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR19"">19</xref>,<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR20"">20</xref></sup>. Finally certain medications used in transfusion therapy such as some antibiotics can induce Met-Hb formation, further exacerbating the condition in TDT patients<sup><xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR8"">8</xref>,<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR21"">21</xref>,<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR22"">22</xref></sup>. To the best of our knowledge, no previous studies have thoroughly investigated the impact of oxidative stress mediated by Met-Hb on endothelial function using EASIX in TDT. Consequently, the aim of our research was to assess the impact of met-haemoglobin and oxidative stress on endothelial function in patients with transfusion dependent β-thalassemia major.  The endothelium has important functions namely; control of coagulation, fibrinolysis, vascular tone and immune response<sup><xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR25"">25</xref></sup>. Normal cellular metabolism generates ROS as a by-product of the mitochondrial electron transport chain. These highly reactive molecules are constantly neutralized by the body’s antioxidant defence system to maintain a state of redox homeostasis. However, an imbalance between ROS production and antioxidant capacity can lead to a condition known as oxidative stress<sup><xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR26"">26</xref></sup>. Table <xref rid=""Tab1"" ref-type=""table"">1</xref> shows that haemoglobin and neutrophils / platelets ratio (NPR) were significantly decreased in TDT patients compared to the control. No significant difference was detected as regards neutrophils, lymphocytes and neutrophils/ lymphocytes ratio (NLR) while the remaining parameters were significantly higher in our patients. These are concordant with Ayyash et al.,<sup><xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR27"">27</xref></sup>. The results of Aldwaik R et al.,<sup><xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR28"">28</xref></sup> was matched with our finding as regards the haemoglobin mean value (8.4 ± 1.4 g/dl) in TDT patients. Solangi et al.,<sup><xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR29"">29</xref></sup> results were matched with us as <italic toggle=""yes"">regards</italic> reduction in Hb and lymphocyte levels but were different for platelet count which was elevated in our study. We can explain the higher platelets in our patients by that 64% of them were splenectomised. Although it is well-known that platelet counts often rise after splenectomy as reported by Sande et al.,<sup><xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR30"">30</xref></sup> yet no systematic study has examined how much of an increase can be anticipated and when exactly these counts will decrease post-splenectomy.<table-wrap id=""Tab1""><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Comparison of CBC parameters between TDT patients and control.</p></caption><table frame=""hsides"" rules=""groups""><thead><tr><th align=""left""></th><th align=""left"">TDT patients (<italic toggle=""yes"">n</italic> = 50)<break></break>Mean ± S.

Basu et al.,<sup><xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR31"">31</xref></sup> metanalysis results are in agreement with our findings. In addition, Neaimy et al.,<sup><xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR32"">32</xref></sup> showed that individuals with β thalassemia had lower total antioxidant capacity values and a higher MDA levels. Al-Hakeim et al.,<sup><xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR33"">33</xref></sup> stated that increased MDA in thalassemia could be due to vulnerability of these patients to tissue injury caused by high oxidative stress. Moreover, formation of MDA is independent of excess non-labile iron concentration indicating that different mechanisms are involved in injury caused by the labile iron and the formation of oxidation end products. An increased risk of cellular and molecular damages caused by oxidative stress and its associated diseases, as well as ineffective anti-oxidant defence systems for β-thalassemia patients was reported by Fatima T et al.<sup><xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR34"">34</xref></sup>. Although serum ferritin (SF) has been demonstrated to be a marker of iron overload, its threshold varies and larger levels are classed differently highlighting the problem of using it generally to predict disease outcomes<sup><xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR35"">35</xref></sup>. In our study SF levels in TDT patients ranged from (772–6849 ng/mL) with a mean value of (2921 ± 1355 ng/mL). Shah et al.,<sup><xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR36"">36</xref></sup> stated that organ damage, greater risk of cardiac events, hepatic problems and increased mortality are among the negative outcomes linked to iron overload which is indicated by SF levels exceeding 1000 µg/L. The wide range of SF in these patients is attributed to many factors i.e. compliance to iron chelation therapy, presence of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection, splenectomy as well as different haptoglobin polymorphism<sup><xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR37"">37</xref></sup>. SF impact is felt by patients at various points in their lives due to the fact that TDT is a chronic condition with lifelong blood transfusion. Garbowski et al.,<sup><xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR38"">38</xref></sup> illustrated that reduction in SF was coupled with increased erythroid iron incorporation and higher bone marrow erythroid production, thereby decreasing transfusion requirements and promoting the redirection of bounded and free iron to the liver. In the present study EASIX was significantly elevated in TDT patients compared to control which works as a novel diagnostic tool for endothelial dysfunction. Luft, T. et al.,<sup><xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR39"">39</xref></sup> found that the levels of EASIX serve as surrogate indicators when determining the amount of endothelial impairment. Our finding is in accordance with Scioli et al.,<sup><xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR40"">40</xref></sup> who showed that higher EASIX reflects endothelial dysfunction that could be attributed to enhanced oxidative stress.  We observed a significant positive correlation between EASIX, Met-Hb, MDA, SF and CRP (r =0.904, r = 0.948, r= 0.772 and r= 0.971; respectively) among TDT patients (Figs. <xref rid=""Fig1"" ref-type=""fig"">1</xref>, <xref rid=""Fig2"" ref-type=""fig"">2</xref>, <xref rid=""Fig3"" ref-type=""fig"">3</xref>, <xref rid=""Fig4"" ref-type=""fig"">4</xref>). These findings eliminate the interaction between oxidative stress and the previously indicated factors that implicate inflammation in causing dysfunction of the vascular endothelium. This is supported by a strong positive connection between CRP, a biomarker of inflammation, and EASIX. According to Liu et al.<sup><xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR9"">9</xref></sup> Met-Hb significantly increases chemokine and cytokine production as well as the expression of cell adhesion molecules through NF-kappa B. Met-Hb-induced endothelial cell activation during infections, hemolysis, or met-haemoglobinemia is of paramount clinical importance.<fig id=""Fig1""><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>Correlation between EASIX and serum Met-Hb among TDT patients.

TDT patients who have a co-infection with HCV face a twofold effect of oxidative stress, as HCV infection exacerbates the activation of free radical production, disrupts lipid metabolism and cholesterol transport<sup><xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR41"">41</xref></sup>. The progression of HCV infection is linked more to oxidative stress, as it causes cellular hypoxia, defective angiogenesis, and an ineffective immune response<sup><xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR42"">42</xref></sup>.The circulating levels of inflammatory cytokines are increased by HCV infection, which also has an impact on endothelial function<sup><xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR43"">43</xref></sup>. Table <xref rid=""Tab3"" ref-type=""table"">3</xref> shows that HCV positive TDT patients experience a more severe degree of oxidative stress (significantly higher Met-Hb, MDA and EASIX) compared to their HCV-negative counterparts. Iron overload, resulting in excessive production of ROS due to the accumulation of unbound iron in hepatocytes, as well as viral hepatitis, can lead to chronic inflammation, liver fibrosis and cirrhosis in TDT patients<sup><xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR41"">41</xref>,<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR44"">44</xref></sup>. Our study demonstrated that Hb, WBCs, neutrophils, platelets, NLR and PLR were significantly lower in HCV positive TDT patients.

According to Abou El Azm et al.,<sup><xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR50"">50</xref></sup> direct bone marrow involvement may be the underlying reason. Additionally, Aref et al.,<sup><xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR51"">51</xref></sup> mentioned that caspase 10 activation and enhanced neutrophil apoptosis were seen. Furthermore, Sulkowski et al.,<sup><xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR52"">52</xref></sup> elucidated that neutropenia is a prevalent occurrence in HCV-infected individuals undergoing treatment being an adverse impact of medication. TDT can impact both PLR and NLR, although the exact mechanisms and clinical implications are still being explored. TDT patients experience chronic haemolysis that can lead to increased breakdown products in the bloodstream, triggering inflammation and increasing bone marrow activity in order to compensate for red blood cell loss, potentially affecting other blood cell lines leading to a possible decrease in PLR<sup><xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR53"">53</xref></sup>. Chronic viral hepatitis is characterised by a persistent inflammatory response in which the PLR and NLR are connected with the course and prognosis of viral hepatitis-related complications<sup><xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR54"">54</xref></sup>. Meng et al.,<sup><xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR55"">55</xref></sup> studied PLR in different HCV infection stages and found that there was a decrease in PLR in chronic HCV infected patients than control, which is matched with our results as regards HCV positive and negative TDT patients. This could be explained by that HCV might indirectly suppress the bone marrow, leading to a decrease in platelet production also chronic inflammation associated with HCV could increase platelet activation and consumption. The decision for splenectomy in thalassemia requires careful consideration of potential benefits and drawbacks regarding disease severity, timing of splenectomy and individual variations in addition to its impact on oxidative stress and endothelial function<sup><xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR56"">56</xref></sup>. Table <xref rid=""Tab4"" ref-type=""table"">4</xref> shows a significantly higher value of Met-Hb, MDA, CRP and EASIX among splenectomised TDT patients. The impact of splenectomy on oxidative stress in thalassemia patients is a topic of some debate. While the spleen plays a role in the body’s antioxidant defence system, researches haven’t shown a definitive link between splenectomy and increased oxidative stress. The effect of splenectomy on serum total antioxidant capacity (TAC) in β--thalassemia patients has been studied by Talat et al.,<sup><xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR57"">57</xref></sup> who found a lower TAC levels in splenectomised children but the difference wasn’t statistically significant.

The relationship between endothelial dysfunction and splenectomy in TDT was investigated by Aggeli et al.,<sup><xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR59"">59</xref></sup> who found that β-thalassemia major patients may experience endothelial dysfunction due to persistent inflammation and splenectomy might make the problem worse. The study adds to our knowledge of how splenectomy may affect variables that cause endothelial dysfunction. For a deeper exploration of the clinical implications of our results and how they might influence treatment strategies for TDT patients, we can shed light on that iron overload leads to oxidative damage in vital organs. Chelation therapy, which aims to sequester redox-active iron, is a used strategy to mitigate oxidative stress in these patients<sup><xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR60"">60</xref></sup>. Endothelial dysfunction, inflammation, thrombosis, leukocyte adhesion and mitochondrial damage are all promoted by oxidative-stress-induced ROS generation<sup><xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR61"">61</xref></sup>. Oxidative stress and endothelial dysfunction are also associated in the pathophysiology of various vascular and metabolic illnesses including peripheral vascular disease, stroke, heart disease and diabetes. Thus, understanding how Met-Hb disrupts endothelium function is essential for designing effective treatments for these illnesses<sup><xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR62"">62</xref></sup>. Strategies to decrease Met-Hb levels, such as administering high doses of ascorbic acid or methylthioninium chloride (new methylene blue), could be applied to TDT patients<sup><xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR63"">63</xref></sup>. TDT emphasises the importance of specific components in oxidative status; N-acetyl cysteine and vitamin E are particularly effective antioxidant supplements among them<sup><xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR64"">64</xref></sup>.",N/A,25 10 2024
