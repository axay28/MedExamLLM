Genotype Characterization and MiRNA Expression Profiling in Usher Syndrome Cell Lines,"Usher syndrome (USH) is an inherited disorder characterized by sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL), retinitis pigmentosa (RP)-related vision loss, and vestibular dysfunction. USH presents itself as three distinct clinical types, 1, 2, and 3, with no biomarker for early detection. This study aimed to explore whether microRNA (miRNA) expression in USH cell lines is dysregulated compared to the miRNA expression pattern in a cell line derived from a healthy human subject. Lymphocytes from USH patients and healthy individuals were isolated and transformed into stable cell lines using Epstein–Barr virus (EBV). DNA from these cell lines was sequenced using a targeted panel to identify gene variants associated with USH types 1, 2, and 3. Microarray analysis was performed on RNA from both USH and control cell lines using NanoString miRNA microarray technology. Dysregulated miRNAs identified by the microarray were validated using droplet digital PCR technology. DNA sequencing revealed that two USH patients had USH type 1 with gene variants in USH1B (<italic toggle=""yes"">MYO7A</italic>) and USH1D (<italic toggle=""yes"">CDH23</italic>), while the other two patients were classified as USH type 2 (<italic toggle=""yes"">USH2A</italic>) and USH type 3 (<italic toggle=""yes"">CLRN-1</italic>), respectively. The NanoString miRNA microarray detected 92 differentially expressed miRNAs in USH cell lines compared to controls. Significantly altered miRNAs exhibited at least a twofold increase or decrease with a <italic toggle=""yes"">p</italic> value below 0.05. Among these miRNAs, 20 were specific to USH1, 14 to USH2, and 5 to USH3. Three miRNAs that are known as miRNA-183 family which are crucial for inner ear and retina development, have been significantly downregulated as compared to control cells. Subsequently, droplet digital PCR assays confirmed the dysregulation of the 12 most prominent miRNAs in USH cell lines. This study identifies several miRNA signatures in USH cell lines which may have potential utility in Usher syndrome identification.","Usher syndrome (USH) is an autosomal recessive inherited disorder that profoundly impacts hearing, vision, and balance. It is characterized by the triad of sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL), vision impairment due to retinitis pigmentosa (RP), and vestibular dysfunction. The prevalence of USH ranges from 4 to 17 cases per 100,000 individuals [<xref rid=""B1-ijms-25-09993"" ref-type=""bibr"">1</xref>,<xref rid=""B2-ijms-25-09993"" ref-type=""bibr"">2</xref>,<xref rid=""B3-ijms-25-09993"" ref-type=""bibr"">3</xref>]. USH is clinically categorized into three distinct types, distinguished by the age of onset of hearing and visual impairments, the severity of hearing loss, and the presence of balance issues. USH type 1 (USH1) is marked by early-onset SNHL, RP-related vision loss, and balance problems that commence within the first decade of life. USH type 2 (USH2) is characterized by the onset of mild to moderate non-progressive SNHL and RP between the ages of 10 and 20, accompanied by normal vestibular function. USH type 3 (USH3) involves progressive SNHL, sometimes accompanied by balance disturbances, with a variable onset time for SNHL and RP. USH presents as a clinically and genetically diverse condition with nine confirmed causative genes. While traditionally considered a monogenic disorder, recent studies have unveiled instances of digenic inheritance [<xref rid=""B4-ijms-25-09993"" ref-type=""bibr"">4</xref>,<xref rid=""B5-ijms-25-09993"" ref-type=""bibr"">5</xref>]. Mutations in eight genes, including <italic toggle=""yes"">MYO7A</italic>, <italic toggle=""yes"">USH1C</italic>, <italic toggle=""yes"">CDH23</italic>, <italic toggle=""yes"">PCDH23</italic>, <italic toggle=""yes"">USH1E</italic>, <italic toggle=""yes"">USH1G</italic>, <italic toggle=""yes"">USH1K</italic>, and <italic toggle=""yes"">CIB2</italic>/<italic toggle=""yes"">DFNB48</italic>, are responsible for USH1 [<xref rid=""B1-ijms-25-09993"" ref-type=""bibr"">1</xref>]. Of relevance to this study, Usher 1 subtypes (Usher-1D and Usher-1B) are indeed classified by the genes which possess the dominant pathogenic mutation, although there are digenic instances reported in Usher patients. Usher-1B (<italic toggle=""yes"">MYO7A</italic>) mutations make up 53–70% of Usher 1 pathogenic variants, while Usher-1D (<italic toggle=""yes"">CDH23</italic>) mutations account for 10–20% of pathogenic variants in Usher 1 patients [<xref rid=""B6-ijms-25-09993"" ref-type=""bibr"">6</xref>]. USH2 results from genetic mutations in <italic toggle=""yes"">USH2A</italic>, <italic toggle=""yes"">GPR98</italic> (also known as <italic toggle=""yes"">ADGRV1</italic>), and <italic toggle=""yes"">WHRN</italic> (also known as <italic toggle=""yes"">DFNB31</italic>) [<xref rid=""B1-ijms-25-09993"" ref-type=""bibr"">1</xref>], while USH3 is attributed to mutations in the <italic toggle=""yes"">CLRN-1</italic>, <italic toggle=""yes"">HARS</italic>, and <italic toggle=""yes"">PDZD7</italic> genes [<xref rid=""B1-ijms-25-09993"" ref-type=""bibr"">1</xref>]. Usher-1B is thought to be caused by mutations in the <italic toggle=""yes"">MYO7A</italic> gene. <italic toggle=""yes"">MYO7A</italic> encodes myosin VIIA, an unconventional mechanochemical protein containing a motor domain, an actin-binding domain, a neck domain, and a short tail domain [<xref rid=""B7-ijms-25-09993"" ref-type=""bibr"">7</xref>]. In inner ear hair cells (IHC), myosin VIIA is thought to aid in correct localization of mechano-transduction channels and ankle links in stereocilia [<xref rid=""B8-ijms-25-09993"" ref-type=""bibr"">8</xref>]. Mutations in <italic toggle=""yes"">MYO7A</italic> disrupt the ability of IHC stereocilia to function properly, resulting in progressive hearing loss. In the retina, myosin VIIA aids in the transport, distribution, and localization of molecules essential for photoreceptor cell function and retinal pigment epithelial (RPE) cell function [<xref rid=""B9-ijms-25-09993"" ref-type=""bibr"">9</xref>]. Myosin VIIA mutations have been shown to result in degeneration of photoreceptor cell and RPE cell function over time [<xref rid=""B10-ijms-25-09993"" ref-type=""bibr"">10</xref>]. Mutations in <italic toggle=""yes"">CDH23</italic>, a gene encoding an atypical cadherin protein, are thought to be responsible for the Usher-1D phenotype [<xref rid=""B6-ijms-25-09993"" ref-type=""bibr"">6</xref>]. Cadherin-related 23 protein is a transmembrane protein with a chain of 27 extracellular cadherin (EC) domains, a transmembrane domain, and a PDZ binding motif thought to aid in anchoring to an actin cytoskeleton, and the atypically long extracellular domains (ECs) are involved in cell–cell adhesion [<xref rid=""B11-ijms-25-09993"" ref-type=""bibr"">11</xref>]. In the inner ear, <italic toggle=""yes"">CDH23</italic> is expressed in sensory hair cells and appears to play an important role in the differentiation of hair cells, specifically the development of the stereocilia [<xref rid=""B12-ijms-25-09993"" ref-type=""bibr"">12</xref>]. In the retina, <italic toggle=""yes"">CDH23</italic> is found primarily in connecting cilium, the basal body complex, and ribbon synapses of photoreceptor cells, maintaining structural proximity for proper synapse function [<xref rid=""B13-ijms-25-09993"" ref-type=""bibr"">13</xref>,<xref rid=""B14-ijms-25-09993"" ref-type=""bibr"">14</xref>]. Mutations in <italic toggle=""yes"">CDH23</italic> have been shown to disrupt the development of stereocilia in cochlear hair cells and can also result in degradation of retinal photoreceptor cell function [<xref rid=""B11-ijms-25-09993"" ref-type=""bibr"">11</xref>]. The functional role of the protein usherin (<italic toggle=""yes"">USH2A</italic>) remains elusive; however, it is speculated to have a role in maintaining efficient cell signaling in ciliated cells [<xref rid=""B15-ijms-25-09993"" ref-type=""bibr"">15</xref>,<xref rid=""B16-ijms-25-09993"" ref-type=""bibr"">16</xref>]. It has also been observed that disruption of <italic toggle=""yes"">USH2A</italic> leads to loss of photoreceptor cells, causing retinal degradation over time, and in cochlear hair cells the absence of usherin during development leads to hair cell malformation and hearing loss [<xref rid=""B17-ijms-25-09993"" ref-type=""bibr"">17</xref>]. Clarin-1 is known to be a glycosylated transmembrane protein which has amino acid sequence homology with stargazin (<italic toggle=""yes"">Cacng2</italic>), suggesting a potential role in hair cell and photoreceptor cell synapse function [<xref rid=""B11-ijms-25-09993"" ref-type=""bibr"">11</xref>,<xref rid=""B18-ijms-25-09993"" ref-type=""bibr"">18</xref>]. Until recently, the effects of <italic toggle=""yes"">CLRN1</italic> mutations on the retina have largely remained undefined, but recently severe photoreceptor degradation has been described in patients with <italic toggle=""yes"">CLRN1</italic> variants [<xref rid=""B19-ijms-25-09993"" ref-type=""bibr"">19</xref>]. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small, single-stranded, non-coding RNA molecules spanning 21 to 23 nucleotides in length that play pivotal roles in post-transcriptional gene expression regulation. These miRNA molecules are integral regulators of cellular homeostasis in both normal physiological and pathological processes [<xref rid=""B20-ijms-25-09993"" ref-type=""bibr"">20</xref>]. Extensive research has underscored the significance of miRNAs in the visual, auditory, and vestibular systems [<xref rid=""B21-ijms-25-09993"" ref-type=""bibr"">21</xref>,<xref rid=""B22-ijms-25-09993"" ref-type=""bibr"">22</xref>,<xref rid=""B23-ijms-25-09993"" ref-type=""bibr"">23</xref>,<xref rid=""B24-ijms-25-09993"" ref-type=""bibr"">24</xref>,<xref rid=""B25-ijms-25-09993"" ref-type=""bibr"">25</xref>]. Specifically, the microRNA-183 family, encompassing miRNA-183, miRNA-182, and miRNA-96, is highly conserved and indispensable for the development and maturation of sensory organs [<xref rid=""B26-ijms-25-09993"" ref-type=""bibr"">26</xref>]. This family of miRNAs plays crucial roles in maintaining normal growth and population of hair cells and neurons within the inner ear [<xref rid=""B27-ijms-25-09993"" ref-type=""bibr"">27</xref>,<xref rid=""B28-ijms-25-09993"" ref-type=""bibr"">28</xref>]. These are also vital for the maturation of photoreceptor cells [<xref rid=""B29-ijms-25-09993"" ref-type=""bibr"">29</xref>,<xref rid=""B30-ijms-25-09993"" ref-type=""bibr"">30</xref>] because disruptions in the miRNA-183 family have been implicated in syndromic retinal degradation and substantial vestibular impairments [<xref rid=""B31-ijms-25-09993"" ref-type=""bibr"">31</xref>]. As growing miRNA research continues to elucidate their important roles in inner ear development and hearing loss, differentially expressed miRNAs thus may have potential future applications in diagnostics and treatment to restore hearing function [<xref rid=""B28-ijms-25-09993"" ref-type=""bibr"">28</xref>]. However, defining precise roles and targets of individual miRNAs involved in neurosensory pathways in the inner ear remains a major challenge. MiRNA studies on hearing loss have relied mostly on animal models due to the inaccessibility of the human inner ear. MiRNAs may also play an important role in retinal photoreceptor cell maturation and functionality [<xref rid=""B29-ijms-25-09993"" ref-type=""bibr"">29</xref>,<xref rid=""B30-ijms-25-09993"" ref-type=""bibr"">30</xref>]. Dysregulation of these miRNAs may cause impaired vision, and hence they have the potential to be used to develop treatment strategies and diagnostic assays. The approach of this study, however, aimed to examine miRNA expression patterns in lymphocyte cell lines derived from Usher syndrome patients, comparing them with those from a healthy individual without hearing, vision, or vestibular impairments. We hope the findings from this preliminary research will assist in the development of miRNA-based tools for future diagnostic applications for Usher syndrome.  In this study, we assessed the expression profiles of 798 miRNAs across different Usher and control cell line types, revealing intriguing variations. The Usher cell lines exhibited distinct miRNA expression profiles, as illustrated in <xref rid=""ijms-25-09993-t002"" ref-type=""table"">Table 2</xref>. These variations were not only evident among Usher type 1, 2, and 3 phenotypes but were also discernible between the USH1B and USH1D genotypes. According to microarray data (<xref rid=""ijms-25-09993-f002"" ref-type=""fig"">Figure 2</xref>), the miRNA expressions in all Usher samples significantly differed from those in the control samples. We hypothesize that these differences in miRNA expression may be further complicated by unique combinations of sequence variants contributing to the phenotype. For instance, in the USH2A cell line, we identified two heterozygous frameshift mutations that appear to have a compounded effect, resulting in the observed phenotype. This compound mutation effect, although somewhat unconventional, has been documented in Usher syndrome, challenging the widely accepted notion that homozygous recessive mutations exclusively underlie the disorder [<xref rid=""B33-ijms-25-09993"" ref-type=""bibr"">33</xref>,<xref rid=""B64-ijms-25-09993"" ref-type=""bibr"">64</xref>,<xref rid=""B65-ijms-25-09993"" ref-type=""bibr"">65</xref>]. In contrast, USH1D, USH1B, and USH3A all exhibited homozygous recessive mutations, aligning with the classical definition of autosomal recessive inheritance in Usher patients [<xref rid=""B34-ijms-25-09993"" ref-type=""bibr"">34</xref>,<xref rid=""B44-ijms-25-09993"" ref-type=""bibr"">44</xref>,<xref rid=""B65-ijms-25-09993"" ref-type=""bibr"">65</xref>]. The miRNA-183/182/96 family emerged as a key player, showing significant downregulation in all Usher cell lines compared to the control, as is evident from both DESeq2 analysis of microarray results (<xref rid=""ijms-25-09993-f004"" ref-type=""fig"">Figure 4</xref>B–D) and ddPCR analysis (<xref rid=""ijms-25-09993-f006"" ref-type=""fig"">Figure 6</xref>B–D). Previous studies have showcased the significance of these miRNAs, as their inactivation in mice led to significant developmental issues in cochlear hair cells [<xref rid=""B66-ijms-25-09993"" ref-type=""bibr"">66</xref>]. Moreover, mutations affecting miRNA-96-5p have been linked to impaired growth and maturation and, in some cases, malformation of cochlear hair cells in mice and humans [<xref rid=""B67-ijms-25-09993"" ref-type=""bibr"">67</xref>,<xref rid=""B68-ijms-25-09993"" ref-type=""bibr"">68</xref>,<xref rid=""B69-ijms-25-09993"" ref-type=""bibr"">69</xref>,<xref rid=""B70-ijms-25-09993"" ref-type=""bibr"">70</xref>]. Additionally, alterations in the expression of the microRNA-183/182/96 family have been associated with retinal dystrophy—also a component of Usher syndrome [<xref rid=""B30-ijms-25-09993"" ref-type=""bibr"">30</xref>,<xref rid=""B31-ijms-25-09993"" ref-type=""bibr"">31</xref>,<xref rid=""B71-ijms-25-09993"" ref-type=""bibr"">71</xref>]. Our findings align with the existing literature, supporting the observation that microRNA-183/182/96 downregulation is consistent across various Usher genotypes and thus may serve as an indicator for Usher syndrome. Notably, our microarray data revealed an average 2.43 ± 0.22 log2-fold decrease in miRNA-183-3p expression, a 2.98 ± 0.27 log2-fold decrease in miRNA-96-5p expression, and approximately a 6.83 ±1.05 log2-fold decrease in miRNA-182-5p expression in Usher samples compared to controls (<xref rid=""ijms-25-09993-t003"" ref-type=""table"">Table 3</xref>). This downregulation across the entire miR-183/182/96 family was confirmed using ddPCR, where Tukey’s HSD post hoc tests indicated significantly higher expression of all three miRNAs in control samples compared to Usher lines, with no significant differences observed among Usher lines (<xref rid=""ijms-25-09993-f006"" ref-type=""fig"">Figure 6</xref>B–D). Interestingly, we observed a significant downregulation of miRNA-28-5p in all Usher samples, with an average 2.22 ± 0.31 log2-fold lower expression compared to controls (<xref rid=""ijms-25-09993-t003"" ref-type=""table"">Table 3</xref>). Although no prior associations between miRNA-28-5p and Usher syndrome have been reported, Ji et al. (2017) suggested that miRNA-28 may target and regulate the expression of the cone-rod homeobox gene (CRX), making it a potential candidate for retinal degeneration, a component of Usher syndrome [<xref rid=""B72-ijms-25-09993"" ref-type=""bibr"">72</xref>]. MiRNA-16-5p emerged as a driver of variation, particularly for control samples, displaying an average 1.51 ± 0.60 log2-fold higher expression in control samples compared to Usher lines (<xref rid=""ijms-25-09993-t003"" ref-type=""table"">Table 3</xref>). Interestingly, some literature links elevated miRNA-16-5p expression to noise-induced hearing loss (NIHL) and even Alzheimer’s disease [<xref rid=""B73-ijms-25-09993"" ref-type=""bibr"">73</xref>,<xref rid=""B74-ijms-25-09993"" ref-type=""bibr"">74</xref>,<xref rid=""B75-ijms-25-09993"" ref-type=""bibr"">75</xref>]. However, our study indicated low levels of miRNA-16-5p in Usher samples compared to controls, suggesting that the hearing loss caused by Usher and NIHL may have different mechanisms. Six miRNAs, namely, miRNA-150-5p, miRNA-155-5p, miRNA-363-3p, miRNA-223-3p, miRNA-let-7a-5p, and miRNA-142-3p, exhibited upregulation in the Usher cell lines compared to the control (<xref rid=""ijms-25-09993-t003"" ref-type=""table"">Table 3</xref>). Among these, miRNA-155-5p, miRNA-142-3p, and miRNA-let-7a-5p were the most abundant miRNAs in the dataset. Notably, miRNA-142-3p made up approximately 37.3% of miRNA copies in Usher samples, compared to 18.5% in the control line (<xref rid=""app1-ijms-25-09993"" ref-type=""app"">Supplementary Figures S1 and S2</xref>). This miRNA displayed an average 1.26 log2-fold higher expression in Usher samples as compared to the control. While miRNA-142-3p has not been previously associated with Usher or sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL), its downregulation has been observed in the aqueous humor of patients with central retinal vein occlusion (CRVO), a condition occasionally linked to retinitis pigmentosa (RP) [<xref rid=""B76-ijms-25-09993"" ref-type=""bibr"">76</xref>,<xref rid=""B77-ijms-25-09993"" ref-type=""bibr"">77</xref>]. Interestingly, our study found miRNA-142-3p to be one of the most abundant miRNAs in all samples, particularly in Usher cell lines (~40% of all miRNA copies), which contrasts with observations of CRVO (<xref rid=""app1-ijms-25-09993"" ref-type=""app"">Supplementary Figures S1 and S2</xref>). Additionally, miRNA-let-7a emerged as a prominent driver of variation in both PCA and DESeq2 analyses, exhibiting an average 1.6 ± 0.61 log2-fold increase compared to control samples (<xref rid=""ijms-25-09993-t003"" ref-type=""table"">Table 3</xref>). In Usher samples, miRNA-let-7a accounted for 2.35% of the total miRNA copies per genotype, while control samples displayed only a 0.9% proportion. Analysis of the heatmap revealed that both USH2A and USH3A exhibited the highest levels of miRNA-let-7a and miRNA-142-3p, while USH1 genotypes displayed lower expression (<xref rid=""ijms-25-09993-f003"" ref-type=""fig"">Figure 3</xref>), especially USH1D. This observation is consistent with the trajectory of miR-let-7a and miR-142-3p vectors in the PCA biplot (<xref rid=""ijms-25-09993-f002"" ref-type=""fig"">Figure 2</xref>). In addition to examining miRNA expression patterns, we conducted a pathway analysis to summarize which metabolic pathways might be influenced by the target panel miRNAs (<xref rid=""app1-ijms-25-09993"" ref-type=""app"">Supplementary Figures S1 and S2</xref>). While there appears to be a diverse array of possible pathways the miRNA panel from this study could be affecting, we would like to consider two limitations. First, the samples from the study are immortalized B-lymphocytes which are not taken from the inner ear or retinal cells most affected in Usher syndrome. Thus, the pathway analysis provided in the supplementary material should be interpreted with caution due to the nature of the cell lines. Secondly, it should be emphasized here that this study is not aimed at identifying the specific function of the miRNAs we identified and their gene targets, but rather whether the miRNAs in this study can consistently differentiate between Usher and control cell lines. Although not necessarily responsible for the inner ear and/or retinal pathology, the identified miRNAs dysregulated in B-lymphocytes cell lines may have potential utility in the identification of Usher syndrome. Targeted exome sequencing identified four distinct genotypes and likely pathogenic sequence variants in cell lines derived from clinically diagnosed Usher syndrome patients: <italic toggle=""yes"">MY07A</italic>, <italic toggle=""yes"">CDH23</italic>, <italic toggle=""yes"">USH2A</italic>, and <italic toggle=""yes"">CLRN1</italic> (<xref rid=""ijms-25-09993-t001"" ref-type=""table"">Table 1</xref>). These genes encode proteins that are critical for the development and/or maintenance of inner ear hair cells and retinal photoreceptors [<xref rid=""B7-ijms-25-09993"" ref-type=""bibr"">7</xref>,<xref rid=""B8-ijms-25-09993"" ref-type=""bibr"">8</xref>,<xref rid=""B9-ijms-25-09993"" ref-type=""bibr"">9</xref>,<xref rid=""B10-ijms-25-09993"" ref-type=""bibr"">10</xref>,<xref rid=""B11-ijms-25-09993"" ref-type=""bibr"">11</xref>,<xref rid=""B12-ijms-25-09993"" ref-type=""bibr"">12</xref>,<xref rid=""B13-ijms-25-09993"" ref-type=""bibr"">13</xref>,<xref rid=""B14-ijms-25-09993"" ref-type=""bibr"">14</xref>,<xref rid=""B15-ijms-25-09993"" ref-type=""bibr"">15</xref>,<xref rid=""B16-ijms-25-09993"" ref-type=""bibr"">16</xref>,<xref rid=""B17-ijms-25-09993"" ref-type=""bibr"">17</xref>,<xref rid=""B18-ijms-25-09993"" ref-type=""bibr"">18</xref>,<xref rid=""B19-ijms-25-09993"" ref-type=""bibr"">19</xref>]. However, the extent to which each patient from these cell lines experienced RP or progressive hearing loss is unknown. Therefore, further exploration of miRNA expression across a larger cohort of patient genotypes is essential to validate the top miRNA trends identified in this study. Nonetheless, our microarray results aligned with ddPCR quantification of the top 12 miRNAs. These 12 miRNAs, characterized by their consistency across both statistical tests and platforms (ddPCR and microarray), are significantly altered in four unique genotypes representing USH1B, USH1D, USH2A, and USH3A subtypes. Some miRNAs, such as the miR-183-182-96 family, are downregulated in all Usher types, while others, like miR-223-3p, exhibited subtype-specific regulation—being highly upregulated in the USH2A genotype but not in the other lines (<xref rid=""ijms-25-09993-f004"" ref-type=""fig"">Figure 4</xref>, <xref rid=""ijms-25-09993-f005"" ref-type=""fig"">Figure 5</xref>, <xref rid=""ijms-25-09993-f006"" ref-type=""fig"">Figure 6</xref> and <xref rid=""ijms-25-09993-f007"" ref-type=""fig"">Figure 7</xref>). It is important to acknowledge certain limitations in our experiments. Firstly, miRNA expression may exhibit tissue specificity. Data exclusively collected from immortalized lymphocyte cell lines may not necessarily reflect miRNA expression in other tissues within the same patient or in non-immortalized cells [<xref rid=""B78-ijms-25-09993"" ref-type=""bibr"">78</xref>]. In addition, EBV transformation of lymphocytes has been reported to cause changes in miRNA levels. Specifically, miRNA-155, also known to be affected due to EBV, is thought to play a role in immune evasion and cell proliferation [<xref rid=""B79-ijms-25-09993"" ref-type=""bibr"">79</xref>,<xref rid=""B80-ijms-25-09993"" ref-type=""bibr"">80</xref>,<xref rid=""B81-ijms-25-09993"" ref-type=""bibr"">81</xref>,<xref rid=""B82-ijms-25-09993"" ref-type=""bibr"">82</xref>]. Interestingly, miRNA-155 is a member of our panel, yet its expression in the control cell line (NBT) remains highly downregulated. So, despite what is reported in the literature, even within our immortalized cell types there is still an expression discrepancy between the Usher and control lines, even in miRNAs known to be changed due to EBV infection. Because we knew that EBV causes changes in miRNA expression profiles in lymphocytes, we used normal immortalized cells as our control. To establish a robust control, we obtained B-lymphocytes from a healthy donor (age 43) with no history of hearing loss, vestibular dysfunction, or visual impairment. These cells were immortalized using Epstein–Barr Virus (EBV), creating a ‘normalized’ healthy control line. This method mirrors the same immortalization technique applied to generate the other cell lines used in this study. Importantly, B-lymphocytes are known to release microRNAs (miRNAs), which play a crucial role in gene regulation, including in the development and function of these cells [<xref rid=""B83-ijms-25-09993"" ref-type=""bibr"">83</xref>,<xref rid=""B84-ijms-25-09993"" ref-type=""bibr"">84</xref>]. Using a similarly immortalized control ensures that differences in miRNA expression between the cell lines are attributed to the disease state rather than the immortalization process itself. Both normal hearing control samples as well as Usher patient-derived lymphocytes were purified from blood and immortalized following standard EBV-transformation protocol. Therefore, we suspect that all miRNAs shown to express differentially in Usher cells compared to controls do so due to inherent pathologies or gene mutations related to Usher syndrome. MicroRNA expression patterns may likely vary depending on the patient’s genotype. In our study, we observed significant differences in miRNA profiles within both the USH1B and USH1D genotypes, despite both falling under the USH1 classification. This divergence is attributed to distinct sequence variants found in different genes, contributing to the observed phenotypic differences. Here we document only four of the many different genotypes which may cause Usher syndrome, acknowledging there is much more work to be done in associating all genotypes and miRNAs. For example, in <xref rid=""ijms-25-09993-f003"" ref-type=""fig"">Figure 3</xref>, miRNA-150-5p would be an indicator of the USH2A genotype, while miRNA-363-3p serves as a better indicator of the Usher type 1 genotypes (<italic toggle=""yes"">MYO7A</italic> and <italic toggle=""yes"">CDH23</italic>). However, one of the main observations from this study is that there appear to be generalizations we can make about the miRNAs selected. First, looking at cluster A in <xref rid=""ijms-25-09993-f003"" ref-type=""fig"">Figure 3</xref>, there are six miRNAs (28-5p, 183-5p, 182-5p, 96-5p, 16-5p, and 19b-3p) which are significantly downregulated in all Usher genotypes. Thus, we might be able to use this set of six downregulated miRNAs to diagnose a potential Usher patient from a blood draw at an early age. If we examine block B in <xref rid=""ijms-25-09993-f003"" ref-type=""fig"">Figure 3</xref>, miRNAs 155-5p, 142-3p, and let-7a-5p all are significantly upregulated in all Usher patients compared to our control. There are generalized miRNA expression patterns that are consistent among multiple genotypes which can potentially be used as broad indicators of Usher syndrome. The top 12 differentially expressed miRNAs demonstrated robust performance across multiple statistical tests, with some having prior support documented in the literature. Thus, these miRNAs warrant further investigation as to their expression in Usher patient samples and across more Usher genotypes to assess their validity as indicators of disease.  This cell-line-based study describes differential expression patterns of 12 miRNAs that may have important roles in the pathophysiology of Usher syndrome. Adopting both microarray and ddPCR techniques, we have shown expression levels of six upregulated and six downregulated miRNAs using transformed lymphocyte cell lines from Usher patients and healthy controls. While some of these miRNAs showed unique expression patterns in all Usher types compared to control, others were distinctly assigned between Usher subtypes (1B and 1D). However, our findings necessitate further investigations involving actual patient populations, which may help unravel the miRNAs’ regulatory mechanisms in neurodegenerative disorders impacting vision and hearing loss.",N/A,17 9 2024
Long-Term Outcomes of Cochlear Implantation in Usher Syndrome,,"Usher syndrome (USH) is an autosomal recessively inherited disease characterized by bilateral sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL) and retinitis pigmentosa (RP), with or without vestibular dysfunction. Subjects with USH experience progressive visual loss from RP for which there is no current treatment, increasing their dependence on hearing for communication. Often, a cochlear implant (CI) is needed to improve speech recognition. USH is both clinically and genetically heterogeneous and historically divided into three phenotypically different clinical subtypes according to severity and onset of hearing loss and whether vestibular dysfunction is present or not (Table <xref rid=""T1"" ref-type=""table"">1</xref>) (<xref rid=""R45"" ref-type=""bibr"">Smith et al. 1994</xref>). The prevalence of USH differs depending on the clinical subtype, with USH1 and USH2 accounting for the greatest proportion of cases. The prevalence of USH is estimated at 4 to 17/100.000 people (<xref rid=""R5"" ref-type=""bibr"">Boughman et al. 1983</xref>; <xref rid=""R25"" ref-type=""bibr"">Kimberling et al. 2010</xref>) and occurs in 3 to 6% of children with congenital deafness (<xref rid=""R5"" ref-type=""bibr"">Boughman et al. 1983</xref>). USH type I (USH1) comprises about one-third of USH subjects, and is characterized by severe to profound congenital SNHL, childhood-onset of RP, and vestibular areflexia. USH type II (USH2) is the most common type, with moderate to severe progressive congenital SNHL and onset of RP in the second decade of life or later, with or without vestibular dysfunction. USH type III (USH3) is rare in most populations, accounting for approximately 2 to 4% of all cases, although it is notably more prevalent in Finland and among Ashkenazi Jewish people (<xref rid=""R35"" ref-type=""bibr"">Pakarinen et al. 1995</xref>; <xref rid=""R32"" ref-type=""bibr"">Ness et al. 2003</xref>). It displays variable progressive SNHL with the age of onset, usually in the first decade of life, variable onset of RP, and variable vestibular function (<xref rid=""R33"" ref-type=""bibr"">Nisenbaum et al. 2022</xref>). Recently, USH type IV (USH4) was defined with late-onset SNHL and RP, and uncertain vestibular involvement (<xref rid=""R1"" ref-type=""bibr"">Abad-Morales et al. 2020</xref>; <xref rid=""R37"" ref-type=""bibr"">Peter et al. 2021</xref>). While late-onset SNHL and RP could phenotypically be characterized as a form of USH, genetically there is an ongoing debate because there is no clear link between the ARSG protein and the other known Usher proteins (<xref rid=""R12"" ref-type=""bibr"">Delmaghani & El-Amraoui 2022</xref>). Because of the late-onset hearing loss and mild progression, all currently reported subjects with USH4 do well with hearing aids and none received a CI (<xref rid=""R24"" ref-type=""bibr"">Khateb et al. 2018</xref>; <xref rid=""R1"" ref-type=""bibr"">Abad-Morales et al. 2020</xref>; <xref rid=""R16"" ref-type=""bibr"">Fowler et al. 2021</xref>; <xref rid=""R21"" ref-type=""bibr"">Igelman et al. 2021</xref>; <xref rid=""R37"" ref-type=""bibr"">Peter et al. 2021</xref>; <xref rid=""R47"" ref-type=""bibr"">Velde et al. 2022</xref>). Therefore, USH4 is outside the scope of this article. To date, nine causative genes have been identified for USH, including five USH1 genes (<italic toggle=""yes"">MYO7A</italic>, <italic toggle=""yes"">USH1C</italic>, <italic toggle=""yes"">CDH23</italic>, <italic toggle=""yes"">PCDH15</italic>, and <italic toggle=""yes"">USH1G</italic>), three USH2 genes (<italic toggle=""yes"">USH2A</italic>, <italic toggle=""yes"">ADGRV1</italic>, <italic toggle=""yes"">WHRN</italic>), and one USH3 gene (<italic toggle=""yes"">CLRN1</italic>, Table <xref rid=""T1"" ref-type=""table"">1</xref>) (<xref rid=""R12"" ref-type=""bibr"">Delmaghani & El-Amraoui 2022</xref>). Variants in the USH1 genes are also associated with nonsyndromic autosomal recessively SNHL, including DFNB2, DFNB12, DFNB18A, and DFNB23 (Table <xref rid=""T2"" ref-type=""table"">2</xref>). Furthermore, variants in <italic toggle=""yes"">WHRN</italic> are associated with both USH2D and DFNB23. The Usher genes encode a variety of proteins that are organized into an USH protein network. In the inner ear, this protein network plays an essential role in the development and function of inner ear hair cells (<xref rid=""R29"" ref-type=""bibr"">Maerker et al. 2008</xref>; <xref rid=""R49"" ref-type=""bibr"">Yan & Liu 2010</xref>). USH1 and USH2 proteins are mainly expressed in hair cells (<xref rid=""R34"" ref-type=""bibr"">Nishio et al. 2015</xref>), while CLRN1 is also expressed in spiral ganglion neurons (SGNs) (<xref rid=""R49"" ref-type=""bibr"">Yan & Liu 2010</xref>; <xref rid=""R34"" ref-type=""bibr"">Nishio et al. 2015</xref>). Children with USH1, born with a profound hearing loss, are considered ideal candidates for cochlear implantation, as they are diagnosed early, have normal inner ear anatomy, normal cognitive abilities, and the potential for regular speech-language development postimplantation. Early bilateral cochlear implantation leads to the most favorable audiological performance and quality of life in USH1 subjects (<xref rid=""R9"" ref-type=""bibr"">Damen et al. 2006</xref>; <xref rid=""R36"" ref-type=""bibr"">Pennings et al. 2006</xref>; <xref rid=""R22"" ref-type=""bibr"">Jatana et al. 2013</xref>). In subjects with USH2, the progression of hearing impairment leads to insufficient speech recognition and, therefore, inadequate communication with hearing aids over time. For these subjects, (bilateral) CI might be the next step in rehabilitation, enhancing speech recognition and overall quality of life (<xref rid=""R17"" ref-type=""bibr"">Hartel et al. 2017</xref>). Similarly, subjects with USH3 experience positive outcomes after CI, although hearing outcomes are variable (<xref rid=""R38"" ref-type=""bibr"">Pietola et al. 2012</xref>). However, previous studies evaluating CI outcomes in individuals with USH used varying follow-up durations (<xref rid=""R9"" ref-type=""bibr"">Damen et al. 2006</xref>; <xref rid=""R36"" ref-type=""bibr"">Pennings et al. 2006</xref>; <xref rid=""R17"" ref-type=""bibr"">Hartel et al. 2017</xref>). Some studies had a follow-up of only 1 year (<xref rid=""R38"" ref-type=""bibr"">Pietola et al. 2012</xref>), while others did not evaluate outcomes for each subtype separately (<xref rid=""R28"" ref-type=""bibr"">Loundon et al. 2003</xref>; <xref rid=""R22"" ref-type=""bibr"">Jatana et al. 2013</xref>; <xref rid=""R2"" ref-type=""bibr"">Alzhrani et al. 2018</xref>; <xref rid=""R41"" ref-type=""bibr"">Remjasz-Jurek et al. 2023</xref>). In addition, as progressive vision loss in individuals with USH amplifies their dependence on auditory perception for communication, assessing the long-term CI performance in this population is crucial. Therefore, this study evaluates CI performance in Dutch individuals with USH, considering each subtype separately at both short-term and long-term.   This study aimed to evaluate long-term CI performance in CI recipients with all types of USH, at both short-term and long-term, considering each subtype separately. Overall, we found excellent long-term outcomes, especially in early implanted USH1 subjects and USH2 and USH3 recipients. Late-implanted subjects with USH1, however, showed poor outcomes regarding speech recognition but indicated a clear benefit from CI in sound localization and sound awareness.

A rare transcript homozygous variants in CLRN1(USH3A) causes Usher syndrome type 3 in a Chinese family,,"Usher syndrome(USH) is a serious genetic disorder responsible for the combined loss of hearing and vision [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR1"">1</xref>].USH was first described by Scottish ophthalmologist Charles Usher. It is estimated that the incidence of USH in patients with congenital deafness is approximately 3.5/100,000 to 16.6/100,000 [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR2"">2</xref>]. It is the underlying cause in approximately9.2% of children with congenital severe or profound deafness. The incidence of USH in patients with congenital deafness is approximately 3.5–16.6/100,000, which makes this disorder more worthy of our attention, as it accounts for approximately 9.2% of children with congenital severe or profound deafness [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR3"">3</xref>]. Moreover, USH is the most form of syndromic deafness after Pendred syndrome. The main clinical manifestations of USH include hearing loss, retinitis pigmentosa, and vestibular dysfunction, with different characteristics and onset times [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR4"">4</xref>]. USH is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern. To date, nine pathogenic genes have been identified and confirmed: <italic toggle=""yes"">MYO7A</italic>,<italic toggle=""yes""> USH1C</italic>,<italic toggle=""yes""> CDH23</italic>,<italic toggle=""yes""> PCDH15</italic> and <italic toggle=""yes"">SANS</italic> for Usher type 1(USH1); <italic toggle=""yes"">USH2A</italic>,<italic toggle=""yes""> ADGRV1</italic> and <italic toggle=""yes"">WHRN</italic> for Usher type 2(USH2); and <italic toggle=""yes"">CLRN1</italic> for Usher type 3(USH3). Progressive hearing loss is a prominent clinical feature of USH3. Patients are diagnosed with hearing loss at an average age of 8–10 years [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR5"">5</xref>], but show rapid progressive hearing loss between the ages of 20 and 30 years. Retinitis pigmentosa (RP) is usually diagnosed after puberty, at a mean age of 17 years, with night blindness as the first symptom [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR6"">6</xref>, <xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR7"">7</xref>]. Unlike the rapid progression of hearing loss, RP progression in patients with USH3 does not appear to differ much from that in patients with USH1 and US2. After puberty, rod degeneration leads to progressive visual field loss, which eventually develops into tubular visual fields and blindness. USH3A patients show different degrees of vestibular dysfunction, and approximately 51% of the tested patients show some abnormalities in vestibular tests [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR5"">5</xref>, <xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR8"">8</xref>]. As early as 1995, Eeva-Marja Sankila et al. [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR9"">9</xref>] mapped the only gene responsible for USH3 to the locus 3q21-25. Then, in 2002, Avital Adato et al. [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR10"">10</xref>] identified USH3A transcripts in humans and mice. By analyzing USH3A expression patterns, the transcript of this gene was identified in the cochlear hair cells and spiral ganglion cells of mice by in situ hybridization technology, and it was named clarin-1. After nearly a decade of unremitting efforts, the locus of the human <italic toggle=""yes"">CLRN1</italic> gene was finally determined to be 3q25.1. Similar to other tetraspanins, <italic toggle=""yes"">CLRN1</italic> retains only a limited hydrophilic region, is subjected to the cytoplasmic or extracellular aqueous phase, and is clearly lacking any functional domain. At least 3 splice isoforms have been reported (Fig. <xref rid=""Fig1"" ref-type=""fig"">1</xref>). All the known <italic toggle=""yes"">CLRN1</italic> mutations are located in the 3 exons of isoform a, except an intron mutation in the intron region between exon 0 and exon 0b of isoform e. It was shown that the main isoform of the <italic toggle=""yes"">CLRN1</italic> gene encodes a 232-amino acid protein predicted to have four transmembrane domains and a glycosylation site in the first extracellular loop [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR10"">10</xref>]. 
<fig id=""Fig1""><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p><bold>(A)</bold> The mutation sites were found in different transcripts of the CLRN1. <bold>(B)</bold> Point mutation of CLRN1 can lead to different amino acid sequence changes in different transcripts</p></caption><graphic http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink href=""13023_2024_3348_Fig1_HTML"" id=""d33e355""></graphic></fig>
 <italic toggle=""yes"">CLRN1</italic> plays an important role in the morphogenesis and maintenance of hair bundles in mouse cochlear hair cells, and may also have synaptic effects [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR11"">11</xref>, <xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR12"">12</xref>]. In vitro biochemical analyses suggested that <italic toggle=""yes"">CLRN1</italic> functions as a molecular scaffold, recruiting proteins involved in cell adhesion at different plasma membrane regions and playing a role in organizing the actin cytoskeleton organization. Consistent with this function, <italic toggle=""yes"">Clrn1</italic> knockout (KO) and N48K knockout mice exhibit dysplastic hair bundles at an early age and are severely deaf by postnatal day 21 (P21) [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR11"">11</xref>, <xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR12"">12</xref>]. However, similar to other mouse models of USH disease, these mice do not have the ocular phenotype of USH3 patients. Despite the presence of genetic and phenotypic features in clinical patients, the molecular function of <italic toggle=""yes"">CLRN1</italic> and its relationships and interactions with other Usher gene products have remained difficult to determine. This chapter describes a molecular etiology study that was conducted for a family with hereditary deafness. There were 2 patients in the family across 3 generations. All patients developed bilateral sensorineural hearing loss (SHL), progressive vision loss and nyctalopia. Through detailed clinical history data, combined with complete physical examinations, imaging examinations and molecular etiology assessments, the molecular pathogenic mechanism of the CLRN1 gene in the immortalized lymphoid cell line was evaluated. This chapter intends to identify the special clinical phenotypes and molecular etiology of families to provide practical and effective genetic counseling for families and descendants and provide more resources for USH3 long-term research in the Chinese population.   In this study, we investigated the clinical phenotype and molecular etiology of 2 persons in a family with inherited deafness across 3 generations. According to the progressive hearing loss and visual acuity loss in the proband and in some patients in the family, accompanied by the proband’s ophthalmic examination, USH3 was initially diagnosed. Two patients carried a homozygous variation of <italic toggle=""yes"">CLRN1</italic> c.474T > A (P.Cys158Ter, NM_001256819.2) or c.302T > A (p.Val101Asp, NM_174878.3). Sanger sequencing was subsequently used to verify the likely pathogenic variants sites in the above two branches, and the verification structure revealed that the homozygous variation of <italic toggle=""yes"">CLRN1</italic> c.474T > A (P.Cys158Ter, NM_001256819.2) or c.302T > A (p.Val101Asp, NM_174878.3) was coisolated with the genotype‒phenotype of the family. USH3 mainly manifests as postlinguistic progressive bilateral symmetrical SHL, and vestibular function may decline, with or without RP occurring before 20 years of age [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR7"">7</xref>]. However, patients with USH3 showed significant genetic heterogeneity and phenotypic specificity. At present, a <italic toggle=""yes"">CLRN1</italic> gene mutation is believed to cause USH3A, and an <italic toggle=""yes"">HARS</italic> gene mutation causes USH 3B [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR15"">15</xref>]. USH3 is relatively rare compared to USH1 and USH2, although Hope et al. [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR16"">16</xref>] reported that USH3 accounted for approximately 20% of USH in Birmingham. Ness et al. [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR5"">5</xref>]reported that this subtype accounted for approximately 40% of all USH patients in Finnish and Ashkenazi Jews. However, in the Spanish population, a study of 89 USH patients with no instances of USH3 was followed by analysis of a sample of 131 families with only 8 USH3 cases, an incidence of only 6% [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR8"">8</xref>]. Familial USH3 has not been reported in the Chinese population; only sporadic cases have been reported due to eye disease. Due to the high phenotypic heterogeneity of USH3 patients not only among different families but also within the same family, Ness et al. [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR5"">5</xref>] believed that the phenotype of USH3 patients with SHL was relatively consistent, and this clinical phenotype was used as an important distinguishing feature to distinguish USH3 from UHS2 and USH1. Another clinical manifestation commonly used to distinguish USH3 from UHS2 and USH1 is the onset time of deafness. Postlingual SHL is characteristic of USH3, whereas prelingual hearing loss is a feature of USH. In this study, the proband had typical USH3 clinical symptoms—from hearing, vision and typical RP—the onset age and development were similar to those found in the literature, but her older brother (II-1) developed binaural severe SHL after birth, night blindness since childhood and, poor binocular vision; moreover, his binocular vision is almost completely gone. Therefore, the clinical manifestations of USH3 patients in this family were not identical. In 1999, Adato et al. [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR17"">17</xref>] found 2 patients with different clinical phenotypes in a nonclose family of Jewish Yemenis, including 1 patient with the USH1 clinical phenotype and the other with the USH3 clinical phenotype. In subsequent studies, the authors reported that the different clinical phenotypes in the same family occurred were because patients with the USH1 phenotype carried the complex heterozygous variation in MYO7A, while patients with the homozygous variation of the USH3 haplotype presented the USH3 phenotype. Ness et al. [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR5"">5</xref>] also found that among 40 Ashkenazi Jews with USH, 16 patients were clinically classified as USH3. Although all patients had <italic toggle=""yes"">CLRN1</italic> mutations, those with homozygous p.N48K showed more severe clinical phenotypes, with particularly prominent audiological manifestations, and the onset age ranged from infancy to over 35 years old. Aller et al. [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR8"">8</xref>] reported that three Spanish families with USH also presented with postlingual bilateral symmetric severe SHL (at age 6: average hearing threshold 70 dB; age 17: average hearing threshold > 90 dB).In a study of <italic toggle=""yes"">CLRN1</italic><sup>p.Y176X</sup> knockout mice, the clinical phenotype of the knockout mice was very similar to that of patients with the <italic toggle=""yes"">CLRN1</italic><sup>p.Y176X</sup> mutation; however, hearing loss occurred early and progressed rapidly, and vestibular function loss occurred much later than hearing loss. These results indicate that clinical confusion may exist between USH3 and USH1 or between USH3 and USH2. However, due to delayed and progressive hearing loss, some patients whose hearing is clinically consistent with that of USH3 have been found to carry variants of <italic toggle=""yes"">USH2A</italic>,<italic toggle=""yes""> USH1B</italic> and <italic toggle=""yes"">USH1D</italic>. Therefore, according to our results and previously reported findings, progressive SHL and postlingual deafness are not important criteria for the diagnosis and differentiation of USH3. With the gradual increase in case data, USH3 clinical phenotypes have appeared in more forms than clinical phenotypes for USH diagnosis, and the genetic diagnosis has become much clearer and more reliable. The main significance of this study is embodied in the following aspects. The NCBI website (<italic toggle=""yes"">CLRN1</italic> clarin 1 [[<italic toggle=""yes"">Homo sapiens</italic>(human)] -Gene-NCBI (nih.gov)) recorded four transcripts (Fig. <xref rid=""Fig1"" ref-type=""fig"">1</xref>), which transcribed different amino acid sequences due to different exons contained. This partly explains why CLRN1 mutations cause heterogeneity in the clinical phenotype of patients. NM_174878.3 and NP_777367(isoform a is encoded by transcript variant 1) contain exons 0-1-2, encoding a clarin-1 protein containing 232 amino acids of approximately 25.8 kDa [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR18"">18</xref>]. All the known <italic toggle=""yes"">CLRN1</italic> mutations are located in the 3 exons of isoform a, except an intron variant in the intron region between exon 0 and exon 0b of isoform e. With the exception of the p.Y176X and P.P.120 K mutations found in Finnish populations [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR19"">19</xref>] and the p.N48K variant found in Ashkenazi Jews [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR20"">20</xref>], most of the other variants have been found in single families. In addition to these three common mutations, 21 missense and nonsense mutations, 2 occurrences of abnormal splicing, 7 deletion mutations, and 3 insertion mutations have been reported to date (Human Gene Mutation Database, Deadline 2023.03). In 2017, Khan et al. [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR21"">21</xref>] reported a <italic toggle=""yes"">CLRN1</italic> intron mutation c.254–649T > G(NM_001256819.1, isoform e)in an inbred family from the Arabian Peninsula diagnosed with USH1, located in the intron region between exon 0 and exon 0b. Through minigene splicing experiments, it was proven that the mutation caused abnormal splicing of exons, resulting in frameshift and early appearance of stop codons. The authors then tested for the mutation site in seven untested Saudi USH1 patients with a related genetic mutation and found that two of them carried the mutation. Pertinently, c.254–649T > G, which is also the human pathogenic mutation reported to date for non-NM_174878.3 transcripts, represents a founder allele that may significantly contribute to deaf-blindness in people on the Arabian Peninsula. Using the prediction software Alphafold2, we found that the homozygous variants [<italic toggle=""yes"">CLRN1</italic> c.474T > A (P.Cys158Ter, NM_001256819.2) or c.302T > A (p.Val101Asp, NM_174878.3)] carried by the familial patients had different effects on different transcripts of <italic toggle=""yes"">CLRN1</italic>. Although we did not obtain direct evidence from patient-derived ILCLs, we confirmed the presence of specific transcripts in HEK293T cells, and through plasmid expression experiments, we observed protein expression differences caused by c.474T > A (P.Cys158Ter, NM_001256819.2). The mechanism may be that the mutation of noncanonical NM_001256819.2 leads to alternative splicing of the canonical transcript, which eventually leads to protein degradation. The <italic toggle=""yes"">CLRN1</italic>c.474T > A (p.Cys158Ter) variant has not been reported before. To the best of the authors’ knowledge, there is no report about this variant in any databases, including The Single Nucleotide Polymorphism Database, The Human Gene Mutation Database, 1000 Genomes Project and ClinVar and Exome Sequencing Project v. 6500. As suggested by the ACMG/AMP guidelines, a pathogenicity analysis was performed: (a) According to the recommendations of ACMG/AMP guidelines, pathogenicity analysis was performed: (a) Through in vitro experiment verification of lymphocyte line construction and plasmid transfection experiment, it was found that <italic toggle=""yes"">CLRN1</italic>c.474T > A (p.Cys158Ter) variant led to abnormal protein expression and impaired gene function (strong pathogenic evidence PS3); (b) the novel variant <italic toggle=""yes"">CLRN1</italic>c.474T > A (p.Cys158Ter) was not identified in control groups, the frequency in the normal population database is “-” when compared that of GnomAD (moderate pathogenic evidence PM2); (c) Hearing loss and RP expression in proband and older siblings are highly characteristic of the <italic toggle=""yes"">CLRN1</italic> gene (supporting evidence for pathogenesis, PP4) and (e) USH3 is a recessive genetic disorder. The affected siblings were found to carry <italic toggle=""yes"">CLRN1</italic>c.474T > A (p.Cys158Ter) homozygous mutations, while the remaining family members had either heterozygous or wild type mutations, confirming that the phenotype of hearing loss and retinitis pigmentosa co-segregated with genotype in this family (supportive pathogenic evidence, PP1). Taken together, the evidence for the c.474T > A mutation is “PS3 + PM2 + PP4 + PP1” and is judged to be a pathogenic mutation (very strong pathogenic evidence). The <italic toggle=""yes"">CLRN1</italic>c.474T > A (p.Cys158Ter, NM_001256819.2) mutation underlies the first report of USH3 in the Chinese population. In summary, we determined that a homozygous variant of <italic toggle=""yes"">CLRN1</italic>c.474T > A (p.Cys158Ter, NM_001256819.2) caused USH3 in a Chinese family because the transcript of this mutation was not the version commonly found in Finnish and Ashkenazi Jewish populations. Therefore, the discovery of this mutation has certain reference value for the study of the pathogenesis and prevention of USH3A, and particular attention should be paid to different transcripts.",N/A,20 9 2024
Concomitant ulcerative colitis and Usher syndrome in a Pakistani patient: A novel case report,"Ulcerative colitis (UC) and Usher syndrome (USH) are debilitating diseases, compromising quality of life. Globally, half a million cases of UC have been reported, whereas USH is the leading cause of genetic deaf-blindness worldwide. The combined occurrence of both these diseases together is extremely rare. In this one-of-a-kind case report, we discuss the implication of a limited resource-setting on the diagnosis of those diseases. A 33-year-old Southeast Asian male, a known case of hepatitis C presented with a chronic reduction of vision and hearing loss and an acute presentation of loose stools, abdominal pain, and weight loss for 4–7 months. Raised inflammatory markers were reported with a C-Reactive Protein (CRP) level of 64.8 mg/dL. Ultrasound of the abdomen revealed mild abdominopelvic ascites. Colonoscopy showed multiple polyps and was biopsied to have fragments of colonic mucosa with moderate active colitis along with ulcer slough. A Computed Tomography (CT) scan with contrast of the abdomen and pelvis suggested thickened bowel, findings all suggestive of UC. For hearing and sight loss, fundoscopy showed retinitis pigmentosa (RP), and pure tone audiometry suggested bilateral sensorineural hearing loss. A probable diagnosis of mild UC and type II USH was made on clinical examination, radiological imaging, and histopathological sampling. UC and USH have genetic mutations that contribute to the disease manifestations; however, none occur mutually. UC has ophthalmic extraintestinal manifestations, but RP, which is the main reported manifestation in USH, is rarely reported in UC. Maximum efforts were exercised in diagnosing and managing the patient effectively despite the limited resources available. The coexisting USH and UC diagnosis in this patient presents as a rare case. More research is needed to further determine a shared immunological basis of the two disease etiologies and therapeutic advancement.","Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a chronic inflammatory bowel disease, with an estimated 5 million cases present worldwide, with a progressively increasing incidence, presenting with bloody diarrhea, abdominal pain, fecal incontinence, and fatigue as intestinal signs and symptoms with erythema nodosum and pyoderma gangrenosum as cutaneous, anterior uveitis or episcleritis as ocular, peripheral arthropathy, and anemia as the main extraintestinal manifestations (EIMs). Diagnosis is based on clinical findings, lab parameters, endoscopic findings, and histopathology. Treatment for remission includes corticosteroids and 5-aminosalicylic acids (5-ASA), whereas maintenance treatment is done with 5-ASA drugs, biologics, thiopurines, and small molecules like Janus kinase inhibitors.

USH Type 1 is the most severe subtype, characterized by symptoms starting early with prelingual SNHL, early onset of RP, and the presence of vestibular dysfunction. USH Type 2 is the most reported type and has moderate-severe SNHL with RP occurring after ten years of age and no vestibular symptoms. USH Type 3 is the rarest, with SNHL arising postlingually, variable onset of RP, and may or may not have vestibular dysfunction patients that do not fit into these categories are classified as atypical USH (<xref rid=""table1-2050313X241272501"" ref-type=""table"">Table 1</xref>).<sup>

</sup> A 33-year-old male with a known case of hepatitis C presented with the following: Initial laboratory workup revealed an elevated CRP of 64.8 mg/dL, decreased total protein levels of 5.1 g/dL, and serum albumin of 1.7 g/dL. Stool culture remained unremarkable. A relevant abdominal examination revealed no significant findings. Radiological imaging included: Histopathology of the biopsy samples taken from the colonic polyps on colonoscopy showed fragments of colonic mucosa with moderate active colitis along with ulcer slough. Based on the results revealed via diagnostic modalities available to us in a resource-limited setting, a probable diagnosis of mild UC was made, and the patient was managed accordingly. To determine the cause of gradual hearing and vision loss, it was noted that he had bilaterally decreased visual acuity. Ophthalmology was consulted for his vision loss, and fundoscopy showed RP. Similarly, otorhinolaryngology was consulted for his hearing loss. Pure tone audiometry was done, and bilateral SNHL was observed (<xref rid=""fig3-2050313X241272501"" ref-type=""fig"">Figure 3</xref>). It is to be noted that his past medical history was significant for gradual, progressive hearing loss and bilateral vision loss, both of which started during childhood. His family history remained positive for similar symptoms as his older set of twin brothers also reported gradually decreasing hearing and vision. The patient was labeled to have type II USH. A differential diagnosis of USH was made based on his clinical findings. Genetic analysis for a confirmatory diagnosis of USH could not be done due to the financial constraints present in our resource-limited setting. Our patient presented with a rare occurrence of two combined disease etiologies, that is, UC and USH. The coexisting manifestation of the two disease spectrums leads to questions regarding their genetic linkage. According to Sarlos et al., not only is UC associated with Th17 (IL-17) and a modified Th2 response (IL-13, IL-5, and IL-9), but recently genome-wide association studies have identified many novel single nucleotide polymorphisms for UC.<sup>

Familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) was also considered as a differential based on the presence of polyps on colonoscopy; however, the mere presence of polyps, not quantified enough, did not qualify as a diagnostic marker necessary for FAP.

"A large-scale screening identified in <italic toggle=""yes"">USH2A</italic> gene the P3272L founder pathogenic variant explaining familial Usher syndrome in Sardinia, Italy",,"With a worldwide prevalence of 4 to 17 per 100,000 individuals, Usher syndrome (USH) accounts for more than 50% of all cases of combined vision and hearing loss [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR1"">1</xref>].
 USH encompasses a group of disorders characterized by congenital sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL) and retinitis pigmentosa (RP). Clinically, RP presents with progressive pigmentary degeneration of rod and cone photoreceptors and the ophthalmoscopic triad of pigmentary changes (bony spicules) at the mid-periphery, pale waxy optic disc, and generalized attenuation of arterioles, which result, firstly, in visual field constriction followed by severe vision loss [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR2"">2</xref>]. Clinically, patients were initially divided into two different groups: one characterized by profound deafness, the other by moderate/severe hearing loss [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR3"">3</xref>]. In 1994, Smith et al. [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR4"">4</xref>] classified USH into three different types (1, 2, and 3), based on age of onset, severity, and progression of auditory, visual, and vestibular symptoms [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR4"">4</xref>]. USH has been considered a monogenic, but genetically heterogeneous disease. Type 1 (USH1), approximately 30% of all USH patients, is the most severe form, with profound SNHL and vestibular dysfunction from birth, as well as progressive RP [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR5"">5</xref>, <xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR6"">6</xref>]. The more common type 2 (USH2), approximately 50% of cases [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR7"">7</xref>], show moderate/severe SNHL, normal vestibular function, and RP with onset at puberty. Type 3 (USH3) is the rarest form [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR8"">8</xref>]. Patients with USH3 develop variable levels of hearing, vision, and vestibular impairment over time [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR8"">8</xref>]. Hearing loss occurs before visual symptoms in all three subtypes. Fourteen USH loci have been mapped to date: nine for USH1, three for USH2, two for USH3, one USH modifier and one atypical USH gene. However, some cases cannot be attributed to these genes and are classified as atypical USH.

Based on autosomal recessive genetic inheritance, we do not identify candidate pathogenic variant in the selected candidate genes, except for the <italic toggle=""yes"">USH2A</italic> gene. We found several variants in the <italic toggle=""yes"">USH2A</italic> gene (Supplementary Table 1), but only two of them were predicted to be pathogenic: c.9815C > T(p.Pro3272Leu) and c.1663C > G(p.Leu555Val). Based on the autosomal recessive model of inheritance, we identified a single potentially causative variant (p.Pro3272Leu) on the gene encoding for the usherin protein. This pathogenic variant causes base substitution in an exonic region of the gene. The functional predictions for amino acid changes according to SIFT and Polyphen were <italic toggle=""yes"">“probably damaging”</italic> and <italic toggle=""yes"">“deleterious”</italic>, respectively, while the CADD score (CADD PHRED = 28,6) confirmed its pathogenicity. The American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics classification identifies this variant as probably pathogenic, but several studies prove in both homozygosity and heterozygosity status [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR23"">23</xref>–<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR25"">25</xref>] the pathogenicity of this variant. Furthermore, the frequency of this variant in the gnomAD database, in non-Finnish European countries, is extremely rare (0.00004406%), in agreement with syndrome frequencies. All patients analyzed were found to be homozygous for the c.9815C > T variant. Since USH is a rare syndrome, several patients from the same geographical area affected by the same pathogenic variant imply a probable founder effect, proven by the identification of an extended haplotype using subjects from all areas of Sardinia. The frequency of c.9815C > T (p.Pro3272Leu) heterozygous subjects was estimated to be 1,89%. Pathogenic variant related haplotype reconstruction in unrelated Sardinian sequenced samples revealed a founder effect (Fig. <xref rid=""Fig1"" ref-type=""fig"">1</xref>). Haplotype analysis surrounding the causal SNP, rs764182950, indicated that the haplotype “TCTCTGCACACAAC” consisting of 14 variants (rs11120635, rs184464579, rs189009821, rs909035231, rs12129576, rs12132110, rs745566865, rs764182950, rs115806383, rs11120637, rs4363405, rs74447991, rs6686574, rs12140781) represents a risk factor for USH in Sardinia. To provide new insights into the structure of usherin and the pathological mechanisms caused by small pathogenic in-frame variants, like p.Pro3272Leu, and to add more information about the coding protein to correlate with genotype–phenotype studies, we built in silico 3D structure of the native and mutant protein. Usherin, the product of the <italic toggle=""yes"">USH2A</italic> gene, is a single-pass transmembrane protein of 5,202 amino acids in humans. The ectodomain of usherin contains a laminin-like-globulin (LGL) domain, 1 N-terminal laminin (LN) domain, 10 epidermal growth factor (LE) domains, 2 globular laminin (LG) domains, and 32 fibronectin III (FN3) domains. The C-terminal intracellular end of usherin has a PDZ binding motif (PBM), which interacts with other USH and deafness proteins, such as whirlin and PDZD7, in retinal photoreceptors and inner ear hair cells. Currently, three-dimensional structure (x-ray, NMR, or single particle cryo-electron microscopy) is not available, because of usherin protein's large size, membrane residence, and potential flexible conformations. To carry out our in-silico studies, we computationally constructed a homology model of the usher protein domain from amino acid 3210 to 3402, where the studied genomic variant is located (P3272L). In addition, the mutated protein was also modelled (Fig. <xref rid=""Fig4"" ref-type=""fig"">4</xref>).<fig id=""Fig4""><label>Fig. 4</label><caption><p>The 3-dimensional structure built through homology model of the domain 3210–3402. <bold>A</bold> wild type protein, in yellow the Proline 3272; <bold>B</bold> mutate protein, in magenta the Leucine; <bold>C</bold> surface wild type protein, in yellow the Proline 3272; <bold>D</bold> surface mutate protein, in magenta the Leucine</p></caption><graphic http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink href=""12886_2024_3578_Fig4_HTML"" id=""MO4""></graphic></fig> To understand the impact of this genomic variant on protein structure and function, we applied in-silico methodologies to study and predict the effects of SNPs on protein stability, in particular the free energy change (DDG). All the tools used predicted that the amino acid change from proline to leucine (P3272L) results in a destabilization of the protein with a decrease in DDG. The tools used were DUET, mCSM SDM and CUPSAT with DDGs of -0.212, -0.377, -0.58, -2.51 kcal/mol respectively. Furthermore, the Mupro tool was also used to establish DDG using only the amino acid sequence of all protein. Again, a destabilization was predicted, with DDG = -037 and -0.78, using Vector Machine and Neural Network, respectively. In this study, we described the clinical and molecular findings of USH patients from three Sardinian families. Molecular analysis showed that the causative pathogenic variant was present in the <italic toggle=""yes"">USH2A</italic> gene. Although the tissue distribution and subcellular localization of usherin are still debated, there is general agreement that this protein is specifically expressed in retinal photoreceptors and developing cochlear hair cells. Usherin is specifically required in both photoreceptors and cochlear hair cells, where it plays a crucial role cell development and maintenance [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR26"">26</xref>]. Pathogenic variants affecting usherin protein cause failure in stereocilia formation and long-term maintenance of photoreceptors, resulting in sensorineural deafness and visual impairment, the main hallmarks of USH [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR27"">27</xref>]. In mutant mice, with the advance of age photoreceptor degeneration can be detected in the retinas. Mutant mice show progressive shortening of inner/outer photoreceptor segments and thinning of the photoreceptor nuclear layer, leading to the loss of > 50% of photoreceptors and dysregulation of the outer photoreceptor segments, by the age of 20 months. These photoreceptor abnormalities have been associated with the origin of CME in the human retina, detected in 10–50% of RP cases [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR28"">28</xref>]. Similarly, in our study three eyes had CME unresponsive to topical and oral carbonic anhydrase inhibitors. The p.P3272L variant was first described as a heterozygous compound in various populations (Italian, Dutch, Caucasian, Japanese, Chinese) and only recently in 3 homozygous subjects of Italian origin [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR23"">23</xref>]: one subject had syndromic RP associated with neuro-sensory hearing loss and two patients had non-syndromic RP with different stage of the severity of the disease. According to the published staging criteria [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR28"">28</xref>], the first one was classified as severe (grade 4–5), while the other two as moderate (grade 3). There are few studies evaluating the impact of pathogenic variants in <italic toggle=""yes"">USH2A</italic> gene [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR29"">29</xref>, <xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR30"">30</xref>], which explored the entire gene structure but not the p.P3272L variant. Sequence alignment of the 32 human usherin FN3 domains showed that 21 of them had the typical β-strands, while F16 and F17 were partial FN3 domains and F3 had a long CD loop. Our pathogenic variant resides in the F16-F17 linker. The model we constructed for the F16-F17 linker [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR31"">31</xref>] shows a U-shaped structure folded in the center at a long loop region. Other pathogenic variants, such as L3145F, C3267R and, C3358Y, reside a few nucleotides away from P3272L and are located at the end of a β-strand or in the middle of loops. Our molecular modeling investigations can contribute to functional studies on pathological mechanisms and therapeutic approaches. Patients with variants in <italic toggle=""yes"">USH2A</italic> gene have clinical severity that appears to be related to the gene mutated and the specific type of variant [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR32"">32</xref>]. Homozygosity for some deletions or for duplications in <italic toggle=""yes"">USH2A</italic> gene has been associated with a severe phenotype [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR33"">33</xref>, <xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR34"">34</xref>]. Evidence indicates that, even within the USH2 phenotype, there may be a gradient of severity depending on the specific variant [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR25"">25</xref>, <xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR35"">35</xref>]. The patients described in this report have a syndromic phenotype, the severity of which correlates with age. The presence of multiple patients homozygous for the same pathogenic variant with a phenotypic severity correlated with the syndromic form suggests that the Sardinian USH phenotype is the result of a founder pathogenic variant on a specific genomic background. In the specific case of our isolated population, the presence of a founder effect is the most probable explanation for the clinical, phenotypic, and haplotypic homogeneity present in the patients analyzed. The features of genetic and environmental homogeneity that characterize the SardiNIA population certainly help to schematize its perfect segregation with the clinical phenotype. Various founder effects have been described in the Sardinian population for autosomal recessive diseases with haplotypes specific to the Sardinian population associated with individual causative variants, such as in beta Thalassemia [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR36"">36</xref>] or Wilson's disease [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR37"">37</xref>]. As evidence of the prevalence of a founder variant in our population is the significant proportion of asymptomatic heterozygotes carrying this causative variant. For comparison, in the southern European population, the most comparable to ours in terms of genomic characteristics, we found 3 p.P3272L heterozygotes in a total of 5741 individuals (allele frequency = 0.0002613) [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR14"">14</xref>]. We identified in the Sardinian general population, in more than 3500 individuals, a USH heterozygote frequency of 1.89 on which we can hypothesize an ancient founder effect to be related to increased rates of inbreeding and loss of genetic diversity in our patients. We attempted to estimate the age of the p.P3272L variant using the method proposed by Voight et al., 2006 [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR38"">38</xref>] (data not shown) but results indicated that the variant is too rare to obtain a robust and plausible estimate of haplotype age. We think that, based on heterozygote frequency, it would be possible to suggest a targeted screening of this variant, if not in the general population, at least in families at risk or with familial USH. Our results suggest that our approach is effective for the genetic diagnosis of USH. This may lead to (1) a more accurate molecular diagnosis, (2) a better genetic counseling, and (3) an improvement in molecular epidemiology data, critical for future intervention plans.

All patients included in this database had provided informed consent previously. In total, 31 patients of 29 families with USH1D were identified. The cohort comprised of 19 female patients (61.3%) and 12 male patients (38.7%). Twenty-nine patients had longitudinal data available.

To the best of our knowledge, it represents the largest cohort described cross-sectionally and longitudinally. To the best of our knowledge, this retrospective study is the first in-depth longitudinal study of USH1D. Despite the early onset of symptoms, our findings suggest that the natural history of macular involvement is relatively slow, and the window for intervention wide – up to 50 years of age in most cases. USH1D appears to be an arguably ideal target for novel therapies, particularly given the high interocular symmetry. There is a need for a prospective natural history study to further investigate disease progression from a functional perspective, as well as further refine clinical trial end points.",N/A,17 7 2024
Adaptive optics retinal imaging in patients with usher syndrome,,"Usher syndrome (USH) is an autosomal recessive disease characterized by hearing loss and retinitis pigmentosa (RP) in some subtypes. In addition, patients can present with vestibular and olfactory deficits (<xref rid=""B1"" ref-type=""bibr"">1</xref>). The syndrome is the most common genetic cause of deaf-blindness (<xref rid=""B1"" ref-type=""bibr"">1</xref>, <xref rid=""B2"" ref-type=""bibr"">2</xref>) and was first recognized and described by Albrecht von Graefe in 1858 (<xref rid=""B3"" ref-type=""bibr"">3</xref>) and further investigated by Charles Usher in 1914. Functionally, RP is characterized by impaired night vision, progressive loss of the visual field and a reduced visual acuity due to the progressive degeneration of the photoreceptors. Fundus features include blood vessel attenuation, disc pallor, cystoid macular edema and peripheral bone spicule derived from the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) changes (<xref rid=""B4"" ref-type=""bibr"">4</xref>). Usher syndrome is subdivided into four clinical subtypes (USH1, USH2, USH3 and USH4) depending on the severity and time of onset of auditory, vestibular and visual symptoms (<xref rid=""B5"" ref-type=""bibr"">5</xref>). At least 9 causative genes have been found and identified to be responsible for Usher syndrome: Five for USH1 (<italic toggle=""yes"">MYO7A, USH1C, CDH23, PCDH15</italic>, and <italic toggle=""yes"">USH1G</italic>), three for USH2 <italic toggle=""yes"">(USH2A</italic>, <italic toggle=""yes"">ADGRV1</italic>, and <italic toggle=""yes"">WHRN</italic>) and one for USH3 (<italic toggle=""yes"">CLRN1</italic>). However, other genes and loci have been proposed and discussed to be related to Usher syndrome (<xref rid=""B6"" ref-type=""bibr"">6</xref>). Hearing aids or cochlear implants can compensate the hearing loss, but so far there is no approved causal genetic treatment for the RP in Usher syndrome. However, over the last several years research on Usher syndrome has increased, with studies on gene and cell therapies providing hope for an efficient prevention of the sensory loss (<xref rid=""B7"" ref-type=""bibr"">7</xref>). Nevertheless, more studies on the natural history of the disease are required to aid planning clinical trials. Reliable and sensitive tools need to be tested and developed to evaluate the effect of experimental treatments. With the availability of adaptive optics (AO) fundus imaging, the non-invasive visualization of the photoreceptor mosaic on a cellular level became possible (<xref rid=""B8"" ref-type=""bibr"">8</xref>, <xref rid=""B9"" ref-type=""bibr"">9</xref>), and abnormalities in individual cone photoreceptor mosaic in patients with various retinal diseases could be studied (<xref rid=""B10"" ref-type=""bibr"">10</xref>–<xref rid=""B18"" ref-type=""bibr"">18</xref>). AO technologies have also been combined with optical coherence tomography (AO-OCT), fundus photography and scanning-laser ophthalmoscopy (AO-SLO), that increased the sensitivity and resolution and thus provided new insights into the effects of retinal degenerations (<xref rid=""B12"" ref-type=""bibr"">12</xref>–<xref rid=""B14"" ref-type=""bibr"">14</xref>, <xref rid=""B18"" ref-type=""bibr"">18</xref>–<xref rid=""B24"" ref-type=""bibr"">24</xref>). In this study we used flood illuminated adaptive optics (FI-AO) camera (rtx1™), an advanced high-resolution fundus imaging method to quantify the photoreceptor mosaic in RP associated with Usher syndrome. Additionally, we compared and correlated the results with those of spectral-domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT), fundus autofluorescence photography (FAF), semiautomatic kinetic visual field testing, full-field (ffERG) and multifocal electroretinography (mfERG) that are used for clinical ophthalmological diagnostics in our clinical routine for inherited retinal dystrophies. The aim was to explore the use of high-resolution FI-AO for diagnosis and monitoring of disease progression. Ten patients with a clinical diagnosis of RP with Usher syndrome and likely biallelic variants in <italic toggle=""yes"">MYO7A</italic> (Usher syndrome type 1) or <italic toggle=""yes"">USH2A</italic> (Usher syndrome type 2) who presented for follow-ups at the University Eye Hospital, Tübingen were included in the study (<xref rid=""T1"" ref-type=""table"">
<bold>Table 1</bold>
</xref>). Exclusion criteria included the inability of a moderate fixation, macular edema, central media opacity such as but not only cataract. In addition, patients with a history of any systemic disease (e.g. hypertension) or other eye complications were excluded. The examinations were approved by the institutional Ethics Committee and adhered to the Declaration of Helsinki. All subjects were informed about the consequences of the procedure and informed consent was received from all subjects. Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS (Version 27.0 SPSS Inc. Chicago, IL) and the graphs were created using JMP16 (SAS institute Inc., Cary, NC, USA). The clinical characteristics and genetic profiles of the patients are summarized in <xref rid=""T1"" ref-type=""table"">
<bold>Table 1</bold>
</xref>, along with a short description of the fundus photography, imaging and ERG results. The patients were between 16 and 60 years old (<xref rid=""T1"" ref-type=""table"">
<bold>Table 1</bold>
</xref>). All USH1 patients had cochlea implants and USH2 patients had hearing aids. The best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) ranged from 20/400 (feet) to 20/20 (feet). One eye had light perception. Here, only limited examinations were possible. The mean BCVA was 0.25 ± 0.43(logMAR) for the right eye and 0.24 ± 0.52 (logMAR) for the left, which is approximately equivalent to 20/40. Our results show that the cone density in patients with RP related to Usher Syndrome using the adaptive optics flood illumination retina camera was decreased compared to previously published data on healthy eyes (<xref rid=""B27"" ref-type=""bibr"">27</xref>). Photoreceptor cell death was seen as a low cone density, along with disorder of the cone mosaic (<xref rid=""f4"" ref-type=""fig"">
<bold>Figures 4</bold>
</xref>, <xref rid=""f5"" ref-type=""fig"">
<bold>5</bold>
</xref>). It is known that the cones within the central 2 degrees area cannot be resolved with AO due to the limit of resolution of the device. However, because a central loss of cones is expected in RP patients with Usher Syndrome, making the remaining cones detectable, the visualization and measurement of cell density could be established in the central fovea and at 1 degree. Therefore, we could observe visible cones in the fovea in the early stages of the disease, as well as a loss of cones outside the fovea, seen as blurry, dark patches. However, due to the anatomical distribution of the cones (<xref rid=""B28"" ref-type=""bibr"">28</xref>), we were expecting a much higher cone density in the central area, especially in the patients with a still good preserved visual acuity. There are other reports that have examined the cone mosaic in RP using AO with similar patterns found as here (<xref rid=""B13"" ref-type=""bibr"">13</xref>, <xref rid=""B29"" ref-type=""bibr"">29</xref>, <xref rid=""B30"" ref-type=""bibr"">30</xref>). Gale et al. (<xref rid=""B29"" ref-type=""bibr"">29</xref>) categorized the changes in cone reflectivity into hypo-reflective blurred cone-like structures, higher frequency disorganized hyper-reflective spots and lower frequency hypo-reflective spots, which mirror progressive phases of cone degeneration observed using SD-OCT and FAF, as also shown by Tojo et al. (<xref rid=""B30"" ref-type=""bibr"">30</xref>) and Ueno et al. (<xref rid=""B31"" ref-type=""bibr"">31</xref>). This was also obvious in our study: The blurry patches and cone density matched the cone photoreceptor degeneration patterns shown by the SD-OCT and FAF imaging (<xref rid=""f2"" ref-type=""fig"">
<bold>Figures 2</bold>
</xref>, <xref rid=""f3"" ref-type=""fig"">
<bold>3</bold>
</xref>). Gale et al. (<xref rid=""B32"" ref-type=""bibr"">32</xref>) have also shown that the repeatability of the results in RP patients is the same as that of control subjects. High-resolution measurements of the cone mosaic performed with the confocal AOSLO (<xref rid=""B17"" ref-type=""bibr"">17</xref>, <xref rid=""B33"" ref-type=""bibr"">33</xref>–<xref rid=""B36"" ref-type=""bibr"">36</xref>), which measures aberrations from the entire scanned area of the retina including the fovea, confirm these findings. Even if the outer retinal architecture in the SD-OCT is normal, the cone density has been shown to range from normal to severely reduced in RP patients (<xref rid=""B17"" ref-type=""bibr"">17</xref>, <xref rid=""B19"" ref-type=""bibr"">19</xref>, <xref rid=""B33"" ref-type=""bibr"">33</xref>, <xref rid=""B34"" ref-type=""bibr"">34</xref>). A study investigating RP patients with Usher syndrome has further shown that the foveal cone density determined with an AO-SLO can be decreased before visible changes in the SD-OCT or a decline in visual function (<xref rid=""B36"" ref-type=""bibr"">36</xref>). This highlights the sensitivity of the high-resolution AO imaging and lends weight to studies demonstrating that visual acuity and sensitivity measurements are relatively poor markers for the severity of retinal degeneration compared to high resolution imaging of foveal cone mosaic (<xref rid=""B11"" ref-type=""bibr"">11</xref>). Nevertheless, one of our limitations is that when using the rtx1 compared to an AOSLO, the cone density may be underestimated due to poor image quality or reflectivity of the cones. It is not possible to distinguish between not waveguiding cells and dark spots. Furthermore, due to the lack of information on patients’ eye length, the cell density could only be expressed using cones per degree<sup>2</sup> (visual units). Moreover, in this study, retinal areas within the hyperautofluorescence in FAF image indicated normal outer retinal structures, whereas the AO-FIO images displayed increased spacing in the cone mosaic, as previously found with, AO-SLO imaging (<xref rid=""B26"" ref-type=""bibr"">26</xref>) and in descriptive analysis (<xref rid=""B15"" ref-type=""bibr"">15</xref>). The ERGs were extinguished in 7 patients and reduced in 3 patients confirming the report by Stingl et al. (<xref rid=""B37"" ref-type=""bibr"">37</xref>) that the ERG is abnormal in Usher patients. Our results revealed a correlation between the mfERG results and the other imaging techniques. The mfERG has been shown to reliably provide even small remaining responses in the macular region of RP patients (<xref rid=""B38"" ref-type=""bibr"">38</xref>–<xref rid=""B40"" ref-type=""bibr"">40</xref>) and was also reduced in all our Usher patients. This study could confirm that the cone density of the central retina was in most cases significantly correlated (<xref rid=""T1"" ref-type=""table"">
<bold>Table 1</bold>
</xref>) to the mfERG response in the central 3° of the retina. When the cone density measurements from AO retinal images were compared with the mfERG recordings from corresponding areas, the analysis indicated that there was a clear correlation between the strength of mfERG responses and the cone density measurements, i.e., lower amplitudes were associated with lower cone density measurements confirming the results of Choi et al. (<xref rid=""B13"" ref-type=""bibr"">13</xref>) using AO images. Granse et al. (<xref rid=""B38"" ref-type=""bibr"">38</xref>) have demonstrated that mfERG and multifocal visual evoked potentials may be more useful for examining remaining visual function in RP patients than visual field measurements. These findings are consistent with the unspecific remaining extent of the visual fields measured in this study. It has been shown that when corrected for age, the preserved kinetic visual field is significantly larger in USH2 than in USH1 (<xref rid=""B37"" ref-type=""bibr"">37</xref>) and patients with USH1 have vastly reduced visual fields already at an early age. A direct comparison of these two cohorts of different sizes and different clinical phenotypes is a limitation of this analysis. However, the heterogeneity of the patients inside our cohorts was high. For example, the 60-year-old USH1 patient 2 still had a comparatively large visual field, preserved scotopic ERG and his retinal layering was more widely preserved than the one of patient 6 (USH2). Due to this heterogeneity, we believe that these ten patients could be compared within the context of their phenotypic expression. In conclusion, we find that FI-AO combined with SD-OCT and FAF imaging are useful and sensitive clinical imaging methods for examining photoreceptor alterations due to RP, although there are clear limitations of AO techniques in the clinical routine. An accurate quantification of structural alterations in the retina is fundamental for monitoring the success of future therapeutical interventions (<xref rid=""B41"" ref-type=""bibr"">41</xref>).

Correction to: Exploring the support needs of Australian parents of young children with Usher syndrome: a qualitative thematic analysis,,Full text not available in PMC,N/A,18 4 2024
Exploring the support needs of Australian parents of young children with Usher syndrome: a qualitative thematic analysis,,"Usher syndrome is an autosomal recessive genetic condition [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR34"">34</xref>] that affects approximately 1 in 6000 individuals globally [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR18"">18</xref>]. Although rare, it is the leading cause of deafblindness worldwide [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR17"">17</xref>]. The syndrome is characterised by partial-to-total hearing loss due to abnormal development of cochlear hair cells, and progressive vision loss due to degenerative changes of the retina involving the photoreceptor cells (referred to broadly as retinitis pigmentosa). Some individuals experience vestibular dysfunction due to abnormal development of vestibular hair cells, which results in difficulties with balance, coordination, and gross motor development [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR34"">34</xref>]. Historically, the diagnosis of Usher syndrome was made on the clinical presentation of retinal changes and/or vision impairment in a patient who was already diagnosed with a hearing impairment. With recent advances in genetic testing technologies, children are now being diagnosed with Usher syndrome in the first years of life, before any signs of vision loss are evident [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR10"">10</xref>]. Three clinically recognized subtypes of Usher syndrome exist, with a fourth atypical type recently proposed [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR33"">33</xref>]. The types vary in terms of the age of onset, severity, rate of disease progression, and presence of vestibular dysfunction [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR23"">23</xref>]. Type 1 is the most severe, due to the presence of profound congenital deafness, childhood onset of retinitis pigmentosa, and vestibular dysfunction. Types 2 and 3 are characterised by less severe congenital sensorineural hearing loss and a lower likelihood of vestibular dysfunction. These types are also characterised by the later onset of retinitis pigmentosa, with progressive vision loss typically beginning in the second decade of life for Type 2 and the fourth decade for Type 3. Type 4 has only recently been identified through molecular analysis and is associated with middle-to-late adult onset of progressive hearing and vision loss [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR19"">19</xref>, <xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR33"">33</xref>]. There is currently no cure for Usher syndrome. The hearing impairment is typically managed with cochlear implants or hearing aids. These provide access to the speech signal and may facilitate the development of age-appropriate expressive and receptive language skills if accessed early, optimally before one year of age [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR13"">13</xref>, <xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR20"">20</xref>]. The significant gross motor delay and balance issues caused by vestibular dysfunction in Type 1 can be supported with physical therapy (i.e., physiotherapy and occupational therapy). With no current regulatory-approved treatment for the vision impairment caused by Usher syndrome-associated retinitis pigmentosa, management largely involves the use of vision aids, adaptive technology and accessing supportive services. Overall, the multiple sensory impairments and the variation across disease subtypes results in complex individual management needs, requiring support from a wide variety of healthcare professionals. Given their child’s complex management needs and the potential involvement of multiple professionals in their care, parents of children with Usher syndrome face a significant burden of decision-making and coordination of care. The coordination role can often include managing the diagnostic process, seeking out a team of healthcare professionals (including surgeons, speech pathologists, audiologists, ophthalmologists, optometrists, orthoptists, physiotherapists, and occupational therapists), scheduling and attending numerous appointments, implementing treatment plans, and seeking out funding to enable access to therapies. In addition, parents may need to take responsibility for communication between the healthcare professionals involved in their child’s care, as has often been reported by parents of children with rare diseases [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR15"">15</xref>]. Parents of children with Usher syndrome have previously reported that these coordination tasks place a significant burden on them whilst they are trying to manage their own grief regarding the new diagnosis and contemplating their child’s future with deafblindness [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR29"">29</xref>]. There is also substantial time pressure involved, as many of the common syndrome management strategies, such as cochlear implementation or vestibular rehabilitation therapy, are most effective when implemented in the first years of life [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR14"">14</xref>, <xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR30"">30</xref>]. Parents anecdotally report feeling pressure to engage in early intervention strategies before their child turns five to maximise preparation for school, and to minimise the disruption to schooling from attending numerous appointments (personal communication, UsherKids Australia). In addition to the challenges stemming from the syndromic features of the condition are the challenges relating to the low prevalence rates of Usher syndrome. Previous work has found that parents of children with rare diseases were largely dissatisfied with health professionals’ knowledge of their child’s condition and were often required to educate health professionals about the condition and appropriate management strategies [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR25"">25</xref>]. They described a lack of disease-specific information, difficulties accessing support groups and challenges connecting with other parents of children with the same condition, all resulting in feelings of social isolation [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR25"">25</xref>, <xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR26"">26</xref>]. At least one parent is often required to reduce or forego paid employment to allow the time and flexibility required to manage the child’s condition. This can contribute to financial and relational stress within the family unit [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR22"">22</xref>]. These sentiments have been echoed by parents of children with Usher syndrome, who reported dissatisfaction with the level of knowledge of medical professionals and challenges in accessing support groups in their geographical location [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR29"">29</xref>]. Whilst previous work, such as the survey study by Rabenn [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR29"">29</xref>], has documented some of the psychosocial impacts experienced by parents of children with Usher syndrome, the support needs of parents have not been explored. Obtaining the views of parents may enable the identification of gaps in current support services, the development of evidence-based recommendations to organisations or support groups tasked with assisting this population, and the creation of effective tools or programs to target the support needs of this population. As discussed previously, Type 1 Usher syndrome is the most severe, due to both the range of symptoms and the earlier onset of sensory deficits. As such, the current study aims to explore the support needs of parents of children with Usher syndrome Type 1 when their child was aged 0 to 5 years. To address the study aim, semi structured interviews were conducted with Australian parents or carers of children with Type 1 Usher syndrome. Modified reflexive thematic analysis was used to analyse interview transcripts and identify themes across participants. The consolidated criteria for reporting qualitative studies (COREQ), a 32-item checklist, was employed to ensure comprehensive reporting of the current study’s methodology and findings [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR32"">32</xref>]. This study was conducted in compliance with the tenets of the Declaration of Helsinki and was approved by the Human Research Ethics Committee of the University of Melbourne (22,754). Participants were six mothers aged 46 to 59 years. No individuals dropped out of the study after expressing interest in participation. All participants had multiple children but only two participants had multiple children with Usher syndrome (P1 and P3 each had two children with Usher syndrome). Characteristics of the participants’ children with Usher syndrome (the first-born child with Usher syndrome for P1 and P3) are shown in Table <xref rid=""Tab1"" ref-type=""table"">1</xref>.<table-wrap id=""Tab1""><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Participant-reported characteristics of their child with Usher syndrome</p></caption><table frame=""hsides"" rules=""groups""><thead><tr><th align=""left""></th><th align=""left"" colspan=""6"">Age of child (years)</th></tr><tr><th align=""left"">Activity/occurrence</th><th align=""left"">P1</th><th align=""left"">P2</th><th align=""left"">P3</th><th align=""left"">P4</th><th align=""left"">P5</th><th align=""left"">P6</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align=""left"">Hearing loss diagnosis</td><td align=""left"">0.7</td><td align=""left"">Newborn</td><td align=""left"">1</td><td align=""left"">1</td><td align=""left"">Newborn</td><td align=""left"">0.7</td></tr><tr><td align=""left"">Evidence of vestibular dysfunction</td><td align=""left"">0.4</td><td align=""left"">8</td><td align=""left"">1</td><td align=""left"">3</td><td align=""left"">1</td><td align=""left"">0.5</td></tr><tr><td align=""left"">Usher syndrome diagnosis</td><td align=""left"">5</td><td align=""left"">10</td><td align=""left"">11</td><td align=""left"">15</td><td align=""left"">3.5</td><td align=""left"">14</td></tr><tr><td align=""left"">Interview for current study</td><td align=""left"">9</td><td align=""left"">16</td><td align=""left"">22</td><td align=""left"">19</td><td align=""left"">10</td><td align=""left"">19</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap> This study explored the support needs of parents of children with Usher syndrome Type 1 when their child was aged between 0 and 5 years. Six mothers reported extensive support needs, in a variety of areas, across the first five years of their child’s life. These needs related to areas of social, informational, practical, and emotional support. Parents described a need for support that was often unmet. They reported needing to connect with and obtain support from peers and others in the Usher syndrome community in an individual and group setting, as well as via social media. An Australian support group for families of children with Usher syndrome did not exist for these participants in the first years of their child’s life, making it challenging to connect with parents of children with this rare disease. Access to disease-specific support groups is a commonly described challenge in the rare disease literature [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR25"">25</xref>, <xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR31"">31</xref>]. Up to 60% of parents of children with a rare disease have described being unable to access an Australian disease-specific support group [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR1"">1</xref>], despite such groups being an important protective factor (von [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR35"">35</xref>]). The lack of an appropriate peer support group impedes parents' access to crucial peer support, which participants in the present study identified as an important source of practical information, as well as reassurance regarding their child’s future happiness and quality of life. Parents also reported a need for information throughout the diagnostic and later management stages. This included needing information about the most appropriate clinical management pathway, support to find and access the required health professionals, and accurate, up-to-date information from their treating health professionals. The parents reported that these needs were not adequately met. These findings are consistent with reports from the rare disease literature, with parents often being more knowledgeable about their child’s disease than the treating professionals [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR15"">15</xref>], and clinicians often lacking formal education and training regarding rare disease management [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR21"">21</xref>]. Furthermore, a recent survey of key allied health professionals (optometrists, orthoptists, and audiologists) involved in Usher syndrome care found that these professionals had significant knowledge gaps regarding the characteristics of Usher syndrome and recommended management strategies [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR3"">3</xref>]. Parents required the practical supports of respite, flexible employment, and financial assistance. Respite was reported to allow parents to engage in their own self-care, the importance of which is, again, supported by the broader rare disease literature [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR26"">26</xref>]. Despite its value, it is challenging for parents of children with a rare disease to access respite, with up to 77% of parents in Australia struggling to find a respite-carer for their child [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR1"">1</xref>]. The existing literature also supports the current finding that parents of children with rare and/or complex conditions require flexible employment in order to be able to provide optimal care to their child [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR4"">4</xref>]. Without such flexibility, many parents, most often mothers, ultimately forego paid employment [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR4"">4</xref>], resulting in financial and psychosocial consequences for the individual parent and family. All parents emphasised the importance of emotional support, particularly to assist them in processing their grief and loss, as well as their concerns regarding their child’s future. Whilst this emotional support was provided by friends and family in some cases, most parents reported needing to access formal psychological support. This need is consistently reported in the literature, which has identified parents of children with rare diseases as experiencing higher rates of anxiety, depression, and insomnia, as well as poorer quality of life, in comparison to controls [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR24"">24</xref>]. In spite of this clear need, many of our participants, as well as participants from previous Australian research [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR1"">1</xref>, <xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR27"">27</xref>], reported difficulties in locating mental health professionals with expertise in the emotional needs of parents of children with a rare disease. From both our findings and those from prior research, it is unclear whether this difficulty is due to a fundamental lack of professionals with these specific skills, or if it is due to a lack of clear pathways to identifying appropriate experts. It may be that mental health professionals need upskilling in providing support to parents of children with a rare disease. Alternatively, a clear and easy to use resource to support families in locating those with expertise in this area may effectively address this need. Parents of children with Usher syndrome Type 1 interviewed in this study reported extensive support needs across a variety of areas: peers, support group organisations, and formal services. Parents reported both psychological, practical, and informational needs. Some support needs were immediate, such as peer-support during the diagnostic process, whilst others related to the potential trajectory of their child’s condition, such as reassurance regarding their child’s future quality-of-life. This research provides valuable information for support groups, policy makers, individual healthcare professionals, and professional governing bodies to use in educating stakeholders and in developing and implementing best-practice guidelines, particularly around early intervention and support.",N/A,21 3 2024
Navigating the Usher Syndrome Genetic Landscape: An Evaluation of the Associations between Specific Genes and Quality Categories of Cochlear Implant Outcomes,"Usher syndrome (US) is a clinically and genetically heterogeneous disorder that involves three main features: sensorineural hearing loss, retinitis pigmentosa (RP), and vestibular impairment. With a prevalence of 4–17/100,000, it is the most common cause of deaf-blindness worldwide. Genetic research has provided crucial insights into the complexity of US. Among nine confirmed causative genes, <italic toggle=""yes"">MYO7A</italic> and <italic toggle=""yes"">USH2A</italic> are major players in US types 1 and 2, respectively, whereas <italic toggle=""yes"">CRLN1</italic> is the sole confirmed gene associated with type 3. Variants in these genes also contribute to isolated forms of hearing loss and RP, indicating intersecting molecular pathways. While hearing loss can be adequately managed with hearing aids or cochlear implants (CIs), approved RP treatment modalities are lacking. Gene replacement and editing, antisense oligonucleotides, and small-molecule drugs hold promise for halting RP progression and restoring vision, enhancing patients’ quality of life. Massively parallel sequencing has identified gene variants (e.g., in <italic toggle=""yes"">PCDH15</italic>) that influence CI results. Accordingly, preoperative genetic examination appears valuable for predicting CI success. To explore genetic mutations in CI recipients and establish correlations between implant outcomes and involved genes, we comprehensively reviewed the literature to gather data covering a broad spectrum of CI outcomes across all known US-causative genes. Implant outcomes were categorized as excellent or very good, good, poor or fair, and very poor. Our review of 95 cochlear-implant patients with US, along with their CI outcomes, revealed the importance of presurgical genetic testing to elucidate potential challenges and provide tailored counseling to improve auditory outcomes. The multifaceted nature of US demands a comprehensive understanding and innovative interventions. Genetic insights drive therapeutic advancements, offering potential remedies for the retinal component of US. The synergy between genetics and therapeutics holds promise for individuals with US and may enhance their sensory experiences through customized interventions.","Usher syndrome (US) is a complex and heterogeneous genetic disorder that impairs both hearing and vision. It is the most inherited form of deaf-blindness and is characterized by the combination of sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL) and retinitis pigmentosa (RP) [<xref rid=""B1-audiolres-14-00023"" ref-type=""bibr"">1</xref>,<xref rid=""B2-audiolres-14-00023"" ref-type=""bibr"">2</xref>]. With a global prevalence of 4–17/100,000, US is a leading contributor to cases of deaf-blindness worldwide [<xref rid=""B3-audiolres-14-00023"" ref-type=""bibr"">3</xref>,<xref rid=""B4-audiolres-14-00023"" ref-type=""bibr"">4</xref>,<xref rid=""B5-audiolres-14-00023"" ref-type=""bibr"">5</xref>,<xref rid=""B6-audiolres-14-00023"" ref-type=""bibr"">6</xref>,<xref rid=""B7-audiolres-14-00023"" ref-type=""bibr"">7</xref>]. These debilitating conditions, arising from genetic mutations, converge to create a unique clinical landscape [<xref rid=""B8-audiolres-14-00023"" ref-type=""bibr"">8</xref>]. In addition to auditory and visual impairments, certain subtypes of US involve vestibular dysfunction, impacting the sense of balance in the affected individuals [<xref rid=""B9-audiolres-14-00023"" ref-type=""bibr"">9</xref>,<xref rid=""B10-audiolres-14-00023"" ref-type=""bibr"">10</xref>,<xref rid=""B11-audiolres-14-00023"" ref-type=""bibr"">11</xref>,<xref rid=""B12-audiolres-14-00023"" ref-type=""bibr"">12</xref>]. Therefore, the syndrome has been clinically subdivided into three main clinical types, USH1, USH2, and USH3, based on the severity and age at onset of symptoms [<xref rid=""B3-audiolres-14-00023"" ref-type=""bibr"">3</xref>,<xref rid=""B12-audiolres-14-00023"" ref-type=""bibr"">12</xref>]. USH1 is characterized by profound congenital SNHL, RP, and vestibular dysfunction, and USH2 involves moderate to severe congenital SNHL and RP. Conversely, USH3 is associated with post-lingual SNHL and RP [<xref rid=""B7-audiolres-14-00023"" ref-type=""bibr"">7</xref>]. The comprehensive spectrum of symptoms profoundly impacts a person’s communication ability, mobility, and overall quality of life [<xref rid=""B13-audiolres-14-00023"" ref-type=""bibr"">13</xref>,<xref rid=""B14-audiolres-14-00023"" ref-type=""bibr"">14</xref>,<xref rid=""B15-audiolres-14-00023"" ref-type=""bibr"">15</xref>]. US is characterized by substantial genetic complexity. Genetic advancements have facilitated the identification of US-causative genes. <italic toggle=""yes"">MYO7A</italic>, <italic toggle=""yes"">USH1C</italic>, <italic toggle=""yes"">CDH23</italic>, <italic toggle=""yes"">PCDH15</italic>, and <italic toggle=""yes"">USH1G</italic> (<italic toggle=""yes"">SANS</italic>) are associated with USH1, <italic toggle=""yes"">USH2A</italic>, <italic toggle=""yes"">ADGRV1</italic>, and <italic toggle=""yes"">WHRN</italic> are involved in USH2, and <italic toggle=""yes"">CLRN1</italic> is the sole confirmed gene associated USH3 [<xref rid=""B7-audiolres-14-00023"" ref-type=""bibr"">7</xref>]. Different types of US are associated with the presence of several mutations in different genes, leading to specific subclinical presentations and subtypes. For example, subtypes USH1B, USH1C, and USH1D are caused by mutations in <italic toggle=""yes"">MYO7A</italic>, <italic toggle=""yes"">USH1C</italic>, and <italic toggle=""yes"">CDH23</italic>, respectively. The genetic landscape of US is further complicated by the existence of digenic, bi-allelic, and polygenic forms, as well as the potential for genetic variants to manifest as non-syndromic RP and deafness [<xref rid=""B7-audiolres-14-00023"" ref-type=""bibr"">7</xref>]. Recent research has illuminated the involvement of additional genes in atypical phenotypes, further underscoring the genetic complexity of US [<xref rid=""B3-audiolres-14-00023"" ref-type=""bibr"">3</xref>]. The discovery of US-causative genes has enhanced our understanding of the molecular mechanisms driving US, as well as has paved the way for precision diagnostics and targeted therapies. Further, research findings have underscored the potential to enhance the quality of life in affected individuals. Progress is being made in therapeutic approaches for US. Cochlear implants (CIs) and hearing aids have been pivotal in addressing hearing loss and have significantly improved auditory and communication capabilities in individuals with US [<xref rid=""B3-audiolres-14-00023"" ref-type=""bibr"">3</xref>]. Particularly, CIs have revolutionized the management of SNHL and enhanced patients’ quality of life [<xref rid=""B6-audiolres-14-00023"" ref-type=""bibr"">6</xref>,<xref rid=""B16-audiolres-14-00023"" ref-type=""bibr"">16</xref>]. However, the challenge remains to address retinal degeneration associated with RP, for which effective remedies are not available to date and which significantly affects a person’s communication abilities and spatial orientation. Gene therapy and emerging drug therapies hold promise for the treatment of retinal degeneration associated with RP [<xref rid=""B5-audiolres-14-00023"" ref-type=""bibr"">5</xref>,<xref rid=""B12-audiolres-14-00023"" ref-type=""bibr"">12</xref>]. Gene therapies, gene editing, and precision medicine offer hope for halting symptom progression, as well as for partially or fully restoring impaired senses [<xref rid=""B6-audiolres-14-00023"" ref-type=""bibr"">6</xref>]. While there remain challenges, such as validating gene causality and understanding rare mutations, the pursuit of a comprehensive understanding of causative genes paves the way to more effective treatments and improved outcomes for patients with US. Genotype–phenotype correlations have been established for selected US-related genes, aiding in prognosis and treatment strategies [<xref rid=""B7-audiolres-14-00023"" ref-type=""bibr"">7</xref>]. Early diagnosis, facilitated by these advancements, is increasingly being recognized as a pivotal step toward effective interventions that can significantly impact disease management and patient outcomes. Genetics combined with early interventions presents a promising avenue for enhancing the quality of life of individuals with US. However, given the complex interplay between genetic factors, clinical interventions, and prognostic outcomes, there are multifaceted considerations. In the context of US, early diagnosis holds dual significance: it enables timely interventions that can help mitigate the progression of SNHL and RP. These early interventions include a range of strategies, from cochlear implantation to gene therapies, that can lead to substantial improvements in communication abilities and visual function. The synergy between next-generation sequencing, early diagnosis, and interventions offers great promise for individuals with US. However, the incorporation of genetic prognostic factors into clinical decision-making demands a nuanced understanding of the interplay between genetics and clinical realities. While genetics can guide interventions, clinical outcomes are the ultimate benchmark. Balancing these aspects ensures that early interventions are not only guided by genetic insights but are tailored to each individual’s unique clinical needs, allowing the most effective management of US. To improve CI outcomes, genetics studies have been conducted to elucidate potential correlations between gene mutations and post-implantation results. However, while the identification of genetic determinants is useful, recognizing the multifaceted nature of CI outcomes is crucial. In the exploration of whether mutations significantly influence implant outcomes, it is essential to acknowledge that genetics is only one facet of the broader landscape. To address the gaps in the literature, we aimed to shed light on the complex relationship between genetics and CI outcomes. We identified genes that positively (“favorable” genes) and negatively (“unfavorable” genes) affect CI outcomes through a comprehensive literature review study of all cases published as of 2000.   Our findings indicate that mutations in specific genes significantly influence the outcomes of CIs in patients with US, emphasizing the need for a personalized approach to treatment selection [<xref rid=""B39-audiolres-14-00023"" ref-type=""bibr"">39</xref>,<xref rid=""B40-audiolres-14-00023"" ref-type=""bibr"">40</xref>,<xref rid=""B41-audiolres-14-00023"" ref-type=""bibr"">41</xref>,<xref rid=""B42-audiolres-14-00023"" ref-type=""bibr"">42</xref>,<xref rid=""B43-audiolres-14-00023"" ref-type=""bibr"">43</xref>]. Although not all results demonstrate statistically significant values, certain genes appear more likely to be associated with “positive” outcomes, as opposed to less favorable or “negative” outcomes, following cochlear implantation. It is evident that the results may be influenced by various biases, and larger sample sizes are required to confirm these hypotheses. However, the statistical significance for mutations in two genes, <italic toggle=""yes"">USH2A</italic> and <italic toggle=""yes"">PCDH15</italic>, not only supports pre-existing hypotheses but also aligns with both the pre- and post-synaptic lesion theory [<xref rid=""B43-audiolres-14-00023"" ref-type=""bibr"">43</xref>], as well as the spiral ganglion theory [<xref rid=""B42-audiolres-14-00023"" ref-type=""bibr"">42</xref>]. The <italic toggle=""yes"">USH2A</italic> gene, which is almost exclusively expressed in the inner ear and more broadly in the peripheral organ, contrasts with the <italic toggle=""yes"">PCDH15</italic> gene. <italic toggle=""yes"">PCDH15</italic> is widely expressed throughout the central nervous system and plays a crucial role in the development of synapses in the auditory pathway. Mutations in <italic toggle=""yes"">PCDH15</italic> can thus significantly impact auditory processing (<uri http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink href=""https://www.proteinatlas.org/"">https://www.proteinatlas.org/</uri> accessed on 18 February 2024). Nevertheless, the pivotal question of whether gene mutations influence CI outcomes necessitates a comprehensive view. Cochlear implantation is a complex procedure influenced by variables ranging from an individual’s overall health and age to cochlear anatomical characteristics and surgical techniques. Therefore, genetic information is only a fragment of the broader picture. It is important to acknowledge that genetics, while potentially influential, is not the sole determinant of CI outcomes. Assuming, despite the study limitations and as suggested by previous research [<xref rid=""B39-audiolres-14-00023"" ref-type=""bibr"">39</xref>,<xref rid=""B40-audiolres-14-00023"" ref-type=""bibr"">40</xref>,<xref rid=""B41-audiolres-14-00023"" ref-type=""bibr"">41</xref>,<xref rid=""B42-audiolres-14-00023"" ref-type=""bibr"">42</xref>,<xref rid=""B43-audiolres-14-00023"" ref-type=""bibr"">43</xref>], that the success of cochlear implantation significantly varies depending on the genotype, genetic testing could become an integral part of the preoperative evaluation for CI candidates. It may help predict the likelihood of successful auditory outcomes post-implantation and assist in personalized treatment planning, optimizing the timing of intervention, and tailoring post-operative rehabilitation strategies to the individual’s genetic profile. However, the identification of a gene potentially favorable for treatment outcomes should not be construed as a guaranteed predictor of success. Understanding why the success of cochlear implantation significantly varies due to <italic toggle=""yes"">PCDH15,</italic> or why <italic toggle=""yes"">USH2A</italic> may favor functional outcomes post-implantation is complex. Although all reported CI cases demonstrated improved performance when compared with rehabilitation using hearing aids alone, the results were not always entirely satisfactory. Despite the potential implications, mutations in certain genes should not be viewed as contraindications to surgery, according to our current knowledge. While genetic mutations can be useful for counseling, management, or rehabilitation planning, they should not be regarded as an absolute barrier to cochlear implantation. The use of genetic information as a prognostic factor is constrained by numerous variables, including age at implantation, the extent of hearing loss, and the onset of symptoms [<xref rid=""B44-audiolres-14-00023"" ref-type=""bibr"">44</xref>]. The variability in CI outcomes due to genetic factors is a subject of considerable research interest. In this perspective, CI outcomes are determined by the molecular etiology of deafness. However, the examination of individual genes involved in US reveals a complexity that is difficult to reconcile with the varied conditions and exceptions observed. Most of the genes under examination are expressed not only in the cochlea but also in the brain. This prompts inquiry into why the effects of mutations would be circumvented in both the cochlea and the brain. Additionally, assuming this hypothesis was accurate, we would expect hearing aid outcomes to be similar yet converse to those observed with CIs. However, this is not evident, as outcomes with hearing aids often significantly differ from those with CIs [<xref rid=""B3-audiolres-14-00023"" ref-type=""bibr"">3</xref>,<xref rid=""B7-audiolres-14-00023"" ref-type=""bibr"">7</xref>,<xref rid=""B13-audiolres-14-00023"" ref-type=""bibr"">13</xref>,<xref rid=""B14-audiolres-14-00023"" ref-type=""bibr"">14</xref>,<xref rid=""B15-audiolres-14-00023"" ref-type=""bibr"">15</xref>,<xref rid=""B43-audiolres-14-00023"" ref-type=""bibr"">43</xref>,<xref rid=""B44-audiolres-14-00023"" ref-type=""bibr"">44</xref>,<xref rid=""B45-audiolres-14-00023"" ref-type=""bibr"">45</xref>,<xref rid=""B46-audiolres-14-00023"" ref-type=""bibr"">46</xref>]. Davies et al. [<xref rid=""B29-audiolres-14-00023"" ref-type=""bibr"">29</xref>] conducted a systematic review and found that cochlear implantation improved sound detection, speech perception, speech intelligibility, and quality of life in most patients with US. Jatana et al. [<xref rid=""B16-audiolres-14-00023"" ref-type=""bibr"">16</xref>] reported that children with US who received CIs achieved significant open-set speech perception and oral communication skills. Hoshino et al. found that late implantation in US patients allowed for sound detection, but speech recognition was more successful in patients with previous hearing stimulation [<xref rid=""B45-audiolres-14-00023"" ref-type=""bibr"">45</xref>]. Nair et al. compared CI outcomes between children with US and a control group and found that speech and language acquisition improved but to a lesser extent than in the normative cohort [<xref rid=""B46-audiolres-14-00023"" ref-type=""bibr"">46</xref>]. Overall, these findings suggest that cochlear implantation can provide hearing benefits for individuals with US. However, the outcomes vary depending on factors such as age at implantation and previous hearing stimulation. Evaluating gene expression in the central nervous system does not provide definitive evidence about the link between genetic mutations and adverse outcomes with CIs. Advancements in the field highlight the potential to improve the lives of those affected by US. Elucidating the genetic mosaic of US informs therapeutic strategies, with gene therapy and new pharmacological approaches showing promise for treating retinal degeneration associated with RP [<xref rid=""B5-audiolres-14-00023"" ref-type=""bibr"">5</xref>,<xref rid=""B12-audiolres-14-00023"" ref-type=""bibr"">12</xref>]. Innovations in gene therapies, gene editing, and precision medicine offer promise for not only halting but also potentially reversing the progression of symptoms and restoring lost senses [<xref rid=""B7-audiolres-14-00023"" ref-type=""bibr"">7</xref>]. The debate surrounding the practical application of genetic prognostic factors in interventions for US is not unwarranted. While genetics can offer valuable insights, clinical outcomes remain central. Cochlear implantation, particularly when guided by genetic information, continues to provide superior outcomes compared to traditional hearing aids, reinforcing the importance of individualized patient care. Speculations of potential correlations between genetic profiles and post-implantation outcomes do exist. However, they must be critically examined within the context of complex genetic interactions and multifactorial determinants of clinical response. Additional research is essential to determine the specific roles of various genes in US and to understand how they influence CI outcomes. The present literature review study provides valuable insights for personalized treatment approaches and underscores the need for further research to elucidate the complexities of genetic influences on CI success.",N/A,26 2 2024
"Identification of a novel compound heterozygous pathogenic variant in <italic toggle=""yes"">MYO7A</italic> causing Usher syndrome type IB in a Chinese patient: a case report","Herein, we report the clinical and genetic features of a patient with Usher syndrome type IB to improve our collective understanding of the disorder. The patient was a teenaged boy with congenital profound hearing loss, progressive visual loss, and vestibular hypoplasia; his parents were phenotypically normal. His pure tone audiometry hearing thresholds were 100 dB at all frequencies, and distortion product otoacoustic emission was not elicited at any frequencies in either ear. Moreover, an auditory brainstem response test at 100 dB normal hearing level revealed no relevant response waves, and a caloric test showed vestibular hypoplasia. Fundus examination revealed retinitis pigmentosa and a reduced visual field. The use of high-throughput sequencing technology to screen the patient’s family lineage for deafness-related genes revealed that the patient carried a compound heterozygous pathogenic variant of <italic toggle=""yes"">MYO7A</italic>: c.541C > T and c.6364delG.

</sup> Studies suggest that syndromic deafness has many different phenotypes and a relatively low incidence. Usher syndrome is the most common phenotype of syndromic deafness. Usher syndrome is the most common cause of hereditary deafness and blindness. It is an autosomal recessive hereditary disease that is characterized mainly by varying degrees of hearing impairment, accompanied by progressive visual field defects caused by retinitis pigmentosa. Some patients also present vestibular dysfunction. Usher syndrome can be divided into types I (USH1), II (USH2), and III (USH3) according to clinical features and severity. Patients with USH1—accounting for 25% to 44% of all patients with Usher syndrome—have the most severe symptoms, with severe to profound prelingual deafness, early-onset (prepuberty) retinitis pigmentosa, and vestibular dysfunction as the main manifestations. Approximately one-quarter of children with Usher syndrome also have behavioral or psychological problems.<sup>

</sup> Within USH1, type IB (USH1B) is an autosomal recessive inherited disease that is characterized by deafness and blindness. It is caused by pathogenic variants in <italic toggle=""yes"">MYO7A</italic>, which encodes the heavy chain of an unconventional actin-based motor protein. The starting point of the present study was the clinical diagnosis of USH1B in a patient who had a novel heterozygous pathogenic variant in the <italic toggle=""yes"">MYO7A</italic> gene. His symptoms were characterized by severe hearing loss, vestibular dysfunction, speech disorders, and retinitis pigmentosa, starting at birth. <italic toggle=""yes"">MYO7A</italic> is located in chromosome 11q13.5; it contains 49 exons and encodes the myosin VIIA protein, which consists of 2215 amino acids and belongs to the myosin family.<sup>

</sup> There are three important regions contained by the protein structure of myosin VIIA: 1) the motor region at the amino terminal is the functional core functional region of myosin, which is responsible for hydrolyzing ATP, generating kinetic energy, and combining with actin; 2) the regulatory region of the neck, which combines with myosin light chain to form an isoleucine–glutamine motif; and 3) the carboxyl terminal of the tail, which mainly regulates the movement of <italic toggle=""yes"">MYO7A</italic>, including the SH3 domain, two FERM domains, and two MyTH4 domains.<sup>

Their son, the proband, had visual, auditory, and motor deficits; together, these findings are consistent with autosomal recessive inheritance characteristics. The specific manifestations of the proband were congenital profound sensorineural hearing loss and progressive vision loss. Moreover, his parents reported that the proband had delayed motor development, achieving sitting and standing abilities later than other children of the same age, and was unable to perform balance-related exercises such as running and cycling. There was no consanguinity between the proband’s parents. Furthermore, the mother was healthy during pregnancy and denied any exposure to radiation or ototoxic drugs, and the father was healthy and had no family history of related diseases. In the proband, high-resolution images of the temporal bone under computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging revealed no abnormalities The pure-tone hearing threshold was above 100 dB at all frequencies in both ears (<xref rid=""fig2-03000605231218924"" ref-type=""fig"">Figure 2</xref>).

Distortion product otoacoustic emission showed a non-significant result; that is, the response amplitude signal-to-noise ratio was <3 dB, the detection rate was <60%, and the distortion product value was <−10 dB. The auditory brainstem also showed no significant response curve at 100 dB normal hearing level. The results of a caloric test revealed vestibular hypoplasia. Additionally, <xref rid=""fig3-03000605231218924"" ref-type=""fig"">Figure 3</xref> shows the results of a fundus examination; the patient had retinitis pigmentosa. An electroretinogram revealed severely abnormal light and dark responses in both eyes; the a- and b-wave amplitudes were significantly decreased and showed a flat pattern. Visual field examination demonstrated that the peripheral visual field was reduced and damaged in both eyes, with a tubular visual field noted. Because the proband’s symptoms and results indicated a diagnosis of Usher syndrome, the clinic recommended that he and his parents undergo genetic testing. Hearing loss is the most common sensory deficit. It usually occurs as the result of a single gene defect, either autosomal recessive, X-linked, or mitochondrial.

</sup> In the present study, next-generation sequencing was performed on the proband and his parents. By targeting all exons and splicing regions of 531 deafness-related genes, two pathogenic variants, NM_000260: c.541C > T (p.Gln181*) and c.6364delG (p.Glu2122fs), were identified in <italic toggle=""yes"">MYO7A</italic> in the proband. A genotype analysis of the family by Sanger sequencing revealed that the pathogenic variants co-segregated with phenotype in the family. The c.541C > T (p.Gln181*) variant was located in the myosin motor domain of the myosin VIIA protein structure, whereas c.6364delG (p.Glu2122fs) was located in the FERM2 domain (<xref rid=""fig7-03000605231218924"" ref-type=""fig"">Figure 7</xref>). Neither variant has been previously reported. Moreover, the variants were located in the splicing region of mRNA, and the sequence is highly conserved. Alterations of the myosin motor domain affect the stability of information transmission and material exchange in hair cells; this affects cellular function and leads to hearing loss. The MyTH4–FERM structural domain mediates interactions between <italic toggle=""yes"">MYO7A</italic> and the Sans and Harmonin proteins. When a point pathogenic variant occurs that affects this structural domain, the translated protein loses its ability to interact with both proteins, which in turn affects its normal function. Both of the identified pathogenic variants lead to the premature termination of translation, resulting in truncated proteins with the subsequent deletion of more than 2000 amino acid residues. This large number of deletions likely has a major impact on the important function of myosin 7A proteins in connecting the cytosolic and cytoskeletal proteins. These altered connections between proteins may lead to the misfolding of amino acids, thus resulting in a loss of the entire protein function.<sup>

</sup> The findings from the present study expand the pathogenic variant spectrum of <italic toggle=""yes"">MY07A</italic> transcripts in Chinese patients with Usher syndrome. They are of great importance for prenatal genetic diagnosis and prevention, genetic counseling, and the future gene therapy of Usher syndrome. We also hope that the identified novel pathogenic variant site may help more clinicians to better understand Usher syndrome, thus leading to the earlier and more accurate diagnosis and treatment of patients. Given that vision gradually decreases in patients with Usher syndrome, early diagnosis can provide patients with enough time to adapt to these changes. ",N/A,12 2023
Which Came First? When Usher Syndrome Type 1 Couples with Neuropsychiatric Disorders,"Usher syndrome (USH) is an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by sensorineural hearing loss (HL), retinopathy, and vestibular areflexia, with variable severity. Although a high prevalence of behavioural and mental disorders in USH patients has been reported, few studies on these psychiatric and psychological issues have been conducted. This work describes the case of a 16-year-old boy affected by congenital bilateral sensorineural HL, presenting a suddenly altered behaviour concomitant with a decrease in visual acuity. To establish a molecular diagnosis, Whole-Exome Sequencing analysis was performed, detecting a pathogenetic homozygous variant (c. 5985C>A, p.(Tyr1995*)) within the <italic toggle=""yes"">CDH23</italic> gene. <italic toggle=""yes"">CDH23</italic> is a known USH type 1 causative gene, recently associated with schizophrenia-like symptoms and bipolar disorders. To date, no studies have provided evidence of a direct genotype–phenotype correlation between USH patients carrying <italic toggle=""yes"">CDH23</italic> variants and mental/behavioural issues; however, considering the multiple biological functions of <italic toggle=""yes"">CDH23</italic>, it can be hypothesised that it could have a pleiotropic effect. Overall, this study highlights the relevance of a continuous clinical evaluation of USH patients, to monitor not only the disease progression, but to early detect any psychological or behavioural alterations, thus allowing a rapid implementation of therapeutic strategies aimed at improving their quality of life and well-being.","The majority of patients concomitantly affected by genetic deafness and blindness are diagnosed with Usher syndrome (USH), which affects 1 per 10,000 Northern European and American individuals [<xref rid=""B1-audiolres-13-00086"" ref-type=""bibr"">1</xref>,<xref rid=""B2-audiolres-13-00086"" ref-type=""bibr"">2</xref>]. USH is an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by sensorineural hearing loss (HL), retinitis pigmentosa (RP), and in some cases, vestibular areflexia [<xref rid=""B3-audiolres-13-00086"" ref-type=""bibr"">3</xref>]. Additionally, this syndrome presents with a clinical and genetic heterogeneity, and it is classified in three main different clinical subtypes. Patients affected by USH type 1 (USH1) display profound congenital deafness, vestibular dysfunction, and prepubertal RP. To date, USH1 has been associated with pathogenic variants within five different genes, namely <italic toggle=""yes"">USH1C</italic>, <italic toggle=""yes"">MYO7A</italic>, <italic toggle=""yes"">CDH23</italic>, <italic toggle=""yes"">PCDH15</italic>, and <italic toggle=""yes"">USH1G</italic> [<xref rid=""B2-audiolres-13-00086"" ref-type=""bibr"">2</xref>,<xref rid=""B4-audiolres-13-00086"" ref-type=""bibr"">4</xref>]. Mild-severe congenital HL characterizes USH type 2 (USH2), while RP appears in adolescence. USH2 may be caused by mutations within <italic toggle=""yes"">USH2A</italic>, <italic toggle=""yes"">ADGRV1</italic>, and <italic toggle=""yes"">WHRN</italic> [<xref rid=""B2-audiolres-13-00086"" ref-type=""bibr"">2</xref>,<xref rid=""B4-audiolres-13-00086"" ref-type=""bibr"">4</xref>]. Finally, USH type 3 (USH3) is associated with rapidly progressing HL with variable age of onset for the vestibular phenotype and RP, and it is caused by variants within the <italic toggle=""yes"">CLRN1</italic> gene [<xref rid=""B2-audiolres-13-00086"" ref-type=""bibr"">2</xref>,<xref rid=""B4-audiolres-13-00086"" ref-type=""bibr"">4</xref>]. A thorough search of the literature highlights an association between USH and various mental disorders, mainly schizophrenia-like psychosis [<xref rid=""B1-audiolres-13-00086"" ref-type=""bibr"">1</xref>,<xref rid=""B4-audiolres-13-00086"" ref-type=""bibr"">4</xref>]. In particular, some studies, mostly case reports and a few observational dated studies, described a co-occurrence of USH and persecutory delusions, depression, mental and behavioural issues, anorexia, panic attacks and anxiety, paranoid schizophrenia, or psychotic disorders [<xref rid=""B5-audiolres-13-00086"" ref-type=""bibr"">5</xref>,<xref rid=""B6-audiolres-13-00086"" ref-type=""bibr"">6</xref>,<xref rid=""B7-audiolres-13-00086"" ref-type=""bibr"">7</xref>,<xref rid=""B8-audiolres-13-00086"" ref-type=""bibr"">8</xref>,<xref rid=""B9-audiolres-13-00086"" ref-type=""bibr"">9</xref>]. Despite these reports, to date, there is still fragmented information regarding the relationship between USH and psychiatric issues, and there are no defined genotype–phenotype correlations. Furthermore, the exact definition of their prevalence still needs clarification, with estimations ranging between 4% and 23% [<xref rid=""B1-audiolres-13-00086"" ref-type=""bibr"">1</xref>]. Indeed, in some cases, the definition of a diagnosis may be hampered by the complex interaction with a patient affected by a severe sensory impairment [<xref rid=""B10-audiolres-13-00086"" ref-type=""bibr"">10</xref>]. As a result, a definitive explanation for the enrichment of mental disorders in USH patients has not been highlighted. Here, we provide a clinical and genetic description of a patient affected by USH1 and displaying psychiatric symptoms. The proband and his family were recruited by the Medical Genetics Unit of the Institute for Maternal and Child Health—I.R.C.C.S. “Burlo Garofolo” (Trieste, Italy). The proband underwent a detailed clinical examination, which included audiometric testing and an ophthalmological assessment comprising fundus oculi evaluation, a visual field test, and an electroretinography. Genomic DNA was extracted from peripheral whole-blood samples of the patient and his parents using the QIAsymphony<sup>®</sup> SP instrument with QIAsymphony<sup>®</sup> Certal Kits (Qiagen, Venlo, The Netherlands), following the manufacturer’s instructions. DNA concentration and quality were defined with the Nanodrop ND 1000 spectrophotometer (NanoDrop Technologies Inc., Wilmington, DE, USA). SNP-arrays were performed with the Infinium Global Screening Array-24 v3.0 BeadChip (Illumina Inc., San Diego, CA, USA), containing 654,027 markers. Illumina’s Genome Studio software v2.0.3 (cnvpartition 3.2.0) was employed to normalize raw image intensity data, genotype clustering, and individual sample genotype calls. Whole-Exome Sequencing (WES) was carried out on an Illumina NextSeq 550 instrument (Illumina Inc., San Diego, CA, USA). Genomic libraries were prepared with the Twist Human Core Exome + Human RefSeq Panel kit (Twist Bioscience, South San Francisco, CA, USA), according to the manufacturer’s protocol. FASTQ files were processed through a custom pipeline (Germline-Pipeline) developed by enGenome srl (<uri http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink href=""https://www.engenome.com/"">https://www.engenome.com/</uri>, Pavia, Italy, accessed on 1 September 2023). Germiline-Pipeline consists of several steps, including FASTQ trimming, FASTQ quality check, FASTQ mapping, marking of duplicates, base quality score recalibration, and variant calling, thus permitting the identification of single-nucleotide variants (SNVs), short insertions/deletions (INDELs), and exon-level Copy Number Variants (CNVs) starting from sequence reads, and finally leading to the generation of VCF files. VCF files were analysed using enGenome Expert Variant Interpreter (eVai) software (<uri http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink href=""https://www.evai.engenome.com/"">https://www.evai.engenome.com/</uri>, accessed on 13 November 2023).

The pathogenicity of variants was assessed through the Human Gene Mutation Database<sup>®</sup> (HGMD<sup>®</sup>) (<uri http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink href=""https://my.qiagendigitalinsights.com/bbp/view/hgmd/pro/start.php"">https://my.qiagendigitalinsights.com/bbp/view/hgmd/pro/start.php</uri>, accessed on 13 November 2023 [<xref rid=""B11-audiolres-13-00086"" ref-type=""bibr"">11</xref>]) and Deafness Variation Database (<uri http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink href=""http://deafnessvariationdatabase.org/"">http://deafnessvariationdatabase.org/</uri>, accessed on 13 November 2023 [<xref rid=""B12-audiolres-13-00086"" ref-type=""bibr"">12</xref>]), which are databases that include possible disease-associated variants described in the literature. The variants’ effects were evaluated using in silico prediction tools such as PolyPhen-2 [<xref rid=""B13-audiolres-13-00086"" ref-type=""bibr"">13</xref>], Sorting Intolerant From Tolerant (SIFT) [<xref rid=""B14-audiolres-13-00086"" ref-type=""bibr"">14</xref>], Pseudo Amino Acid Protein Intolerance Variant Predictor (PaPI score) [<xref rid=""B15-audiolres-13-00086"" ref-type=""bibr"">15</xref>], and Deep Neural Network Variant Predictor (DANN score) [<xref rid=""B16-audiolres-13-00086"" ref-type=""bibr"">16</xref>]. Moreover, the variants were discussed within a multidisciplinary team, and finally confirmed by Sanger sequencing in the proband and his parents. The proband is a 16-year-old Caucasian boy born to healthy parents (II:2, II:3, <xref rid=""audiolres-13-00086-f001"" ref-type=""fig"">Figure 1</xref>). The pregnancy was spontaneous and ended prematurely at 30 weeks and 5 days of gestation. No consanguinity is reported between the parents, but both were born in a small village in north-east Italy with less than 1000 inhabitants. The proband’s younger brother (III:3, <xref rid=""audiolres-13-00086-f001"" ref-type=""fig"">Figure 1</xref>) is reported to be in good health. The family history of the proband is negative for congenital sensory defects, malformations, and intellectual disability. In detail, the proband was diagnosed with profound bilateral HL at birth. In particular, the newborn hearing screening detected a bilateral hearing loss, subsequently confirmed with the Auditory Brainstem Response test. The proband received a first cochlear implant at two years old, and the second at seven years of age. Computed tomography was performed when he was seven years old, revealing a normal inner ear morphology. Other than a slightly impaired equilibrium, no additional symptoms were described during early childhood. In elementary school, the proband received additional support from a dedicated teacher, but no cognitive impairment was detected. First-tier genetic testing, including <italic toggle=""yes"">GJB2</italic>, <italic toggle=""yes"">GJB6</italic>, and <italic toggle=""yes"">SLC26A4</italic> analyses, did not detect any pathogenic variants possibly associated with his phenotype. No additional clinical and genetic examinations were carried out until the proband was 16 years old. At this age, the proband came to medical attention due to the sudden worsening of his visual acuity. Therefore, the patient underwent electroretinography, revealing highly impaired retinal functionality, with both scotopic and photopic characteristics. Furthermore, during the clinical examination, the patient displayed an avoidant behaviour. His parents reported that he recently developed insomnia and aggressive behaviours, concomitant with high school beginning and the onset of visual impairment. Notably, the proband’s behavioural problems became so severe that they started to strongly interfere with his everyday life, to the point that he began to refuse to attend school lessons. Therefore, the proband underwent several neuropsychiatric evaluations with a psychologist, a neuropsychiatrist, and a psychotherapist. Thus, he started treatment with 20 mg/day of fluoxetine. Unfortunately, the patient began to display hetero-aggressive behaviour, so the pharmacological treatment was then combined with 0.5 mg/day of risperidone, subsequently increased to 1 mg/day. Considering the recent development of additional symptoms, further genetic analyses, as SNP-arrays and WES, were performed. SNP-arrays analysis excluded the presence of micro-deletions/duplications. In particular, no significant CNVs were detected in the proband and his parents. However, three large homozygosity regions were identified in the proband. Specifically, the first one of 15 Mb was detected in 4q32.2.q34.2, while the other two of 10 Mb and 6 Mb were identified, respectively, in 10q21.3q22.2 and 13q32.2q33.1. Concerning WES data, analysis results revealed the presence of a homozygous variant, c.5985C>A, p.(Tyr1995*) within the <italic toggle=""yes"">CDH23</italic> (NM_022124.6) gene, inherited from both parents. Notably, the <italic toggle=""yes"">CDH23</italic> gene is located in the 10q22.1 genomic region, which is within one of the three large homozygosity regions identified by the SNP-arrays analysis. The variant is not described in the gnomAD (<uri http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink href=""https://gnomad.broadinstitute.org/"">https://gnomad.broadinstitute.org/</uri>, accessed on 13 November 2023). It is predicted to be damaging by the in silico prediction tools employed during the analysis (e.g., PaPI, DANN score), and as pathogenetic according to the commonly adopted ACMG/AMP guidelines [<xref rid=""B17-audiolres-13-00086"" ref-type=""bibr"">17</xref>]. Indeed, considering that nonsense variants within <italic toggle=""yes"">CDH23</italic> are a known cause of USH, it was possible to apply the criteria <italic toggle=""yes"">Pathogenic Very Strong 1</italic> (PVS1) [<xref rid=""B17-audiolres-13-00086"" ref-type=""bibr"">17</xref>]. Furthermore, the variant absence from public databases reporting genomic variants identified in the healthy population (e.g., gnomAD) allowed us to apply the criteria <italic toggle=""yes"">Pathogenic Moderate 2</italic> (PM2) [<xref rid=""B17-audiolres-13-00086"" ref-type=""bibr"">17</xref>]. In addition, as previously stated, several in silico prediction tools described the variant as “damaging”, fulfilling the requirements needed to apply the criteria <italic toggle=""yes"">Pathogenic Supporting 3</italic> (PP3) [<xref rid=""B17-audiolres-13-00086"" ref-type=""bibr"">17</xref>]. Further, the variant is classified as pathogenic in reference databases for variant interpretation such as the HGMD [<xref rid=""B11-audiolres-13-00086"" ref-type=""bibr"">11</xref>] and the Deafness Variation Database [<xref rid=""B12-audiolres-13-00086"" ref-type=""bibr"">12</xref>], which report possibly disease-causing variants identified in patients affected by different conditions. Finally, the variant has already been identified in compound heterozygosis with other variants in two additional USH patients [<xref rid=""B18-audiolres-13-00086"" ref-type=""bibr"">18</xref>,<xref rid=""B19-audiolres-13-00086"" ref-type=""bibr"">19</xref>]. USH1 is an autosomal recessive disease characterized by congenital, bilateral, sensorineural HL, adolescent-onset RP, and vestibular areflexia with variable severity and age onset [<xref rid=""B3-audiolres-13-00086"" ref-type=""bibr"">3</xref>]. An association between USH and various mental and behavioural disorders has been observed, spanning from atypical autism to persecutory delusions, aggressive and anxious behaviour, and schizophrenia [<xref rid=""B1-audiolres-13-00086"" ref-type=""bibr"">1</xref>,<xref rid=""B9-audiolres-13-00086"" ref-type=""bibr"">9</xref>,<xref rid=""B20-audiolres-13-00086"" ref-type=""bibr"">20</xref>,<xref rid=""B21-audiolres-13-00086"" ref-type=""bibr"">21</xref>]. However, despite this evidence, a limited number of studies on psychiatric and psychological issues in this syndrome have been performed [<xref rid=""B1-audiolres-13-00086"" ref-type=""bibr"">1</xref>,<xref rid=""B4-audiolres-13-00086"" ref-type=""bibr"">4</xref>]. In addition, in the literature, there are still conflicting data regarding the prevalence of neuropsychiatric disorders among USH patients, which ranges between ~4 and 23% [<xref rid=""B1-audiolres-13-00086"" ref-type=""bibr"">1</xref>]. These discrepancies may be ascribed, for example, to the impaired communication skills of some patients. This communication barrier may hamper psychometric evaluations, and thus the definition of a mental illness diagnosis [<xref rid=""B1-audiolres-13-00086"" ref-type=""bibr"">1</xref>]. Here, we described a case of a 16-year-old boy with clinical symptoms and a molecular diagnosis of USH1, displaying congenital HL, progressive RP, and behavioural issues. The proband carries a predicted damaging homozygous variant, c.5985C>A, p.(Tyr1995*), within the <italic toggle=""yes"">CDH23</italic> (NM_022124.6) gene. <italic toggle=""yes"">CDH23</italic> is a known USH1 causative gene, and the variant here identified was already reported in the compound heterozygous state in other USH patients [<xref rid=""B18-audiolres-13-00086"" ref-type=""bibr"">18</xref>,<xref rid=""B19-audiolres-13-00086"" ref-type=""bibr"">19</xref>]; however, details regarding clinical, psychological, and behavioural aspects of these patients were not reported. The <italic toggle=""yes"">CDH23</italic> gene encodes the Cadherin-related family member 23 protein, an atypical cadherin that regulates a variety of cellular processes, including cell–cell adhesion, mechano-electrical transduction, and hair cell bundles’ organisation [<xref rid=""B22-audiolres-13-00086"" ref-type=""bibr"">22</xref>,<xref rid=""B23-audiolres-13-00086"" ref-type=""bibr"">23</xref>]. Notably, this gene is reported to modulate synapse function, neuron growth, and plasticity [<xref rid=""B24-audiolres-13-00086"" ref-type=""bibr"">24</xref>]. Recently, it has been also demonstrated that <italic toggle=""yes"">CDH23</italic> is expressed in subthalamic and pontine regions in mice models [<xref rid=""B23-audiolres-13-00086"" ref-type=""bibr"">23</xref>], and a similar expression pattern was also identified in the marmoset <italic toggle=""yes"">Callithrix jacchus</italic>; consequently, a functional conservation of this gene has been hypothesised [<xref rid=""B23-audiolres-13-00086"" ref-type=""bibr"">23</xref>]. Specifically, it was reported that in mice models, <italic toggle=""yes"">CDH23</italic> regulates the prepulse inhibition (PPI) neural circuit [<xref rid=""B23-audiolres-13-00086"" ref-type=""bibr"">23</xref>], which is a neurological phenomenon known to be altered in several psychiatric disorders, including schizophrenia, Asperger’s syndrome [<xref rid=""B25-audiolres-13-00086"" ref-type=""bibr"">25</xref>], antisocial personality disorder, and violent behaviour [<xref rid=""B26-audiolres-13-00086"" ref-type=""bibr"">26</xref>]. Several hypotheses have been proposed to explain the mechanisms underlying the onset of behavioural and mental disorders in USH syndrome: (i) the stress-related theory, (ii) the brain damage theory; and (iii) the genetic hypothesis [<xref rid=""B1-audiolres-13-00086"" ref-type=""bibr"">1</xref>,<xref rid=""B21-audiolres-13-00086"" ref-type=""bibr"">21</xref>]. The stress-related theory states that the combination of impaired hearing function and progressive decrease in vision acuity has a negative impact on the patient’s psychological well-being, thus resulting in severe psychological stress, depression, communication difficulties, and social isolation [<xref rid=""B4-audiolres-13-00086"" ref-type=""bibr"">4</xref>,<xref rid=""B21-audiolres-13-00086"" ref-type=""bibr"">21</xref>]. Notably, this aspect is worse in USH children, which may mean they encounter more difficulties in language, cognitive development, and social communication, therefore being more susceptible to developing psychiatric and behavioural disorders [<xref rid=""B1-audiolres-13-00086"" ref-type=""bibr"">1</xref>]. In this light, early diagnosis, language rehabilitation, and psychological support are fundamental in preventing these psychiatric issues. The brain damage theory is derived from the observation of neurological abnormalities in USH patients, such as cerebellar and cerebral atrophy, focal lesions, corpus callosum hypoplasia, fourth ventricle dilatation, and a decrease in intracranial volume [<xref rid=""B1-audiolres-13-00086"" ref-type=""bibr"">1</xref>,<xref rid=""B27-audiolres-13-00086"" ref-type=""bibr"">27</xref>,<xref rid=""B28-audiolres-13-00086"" ref-type=""bibr"">28</xref>], suggesting a pleiotropic effect of USH causative genes. Finally, a third branch of studies states that many USH genes can predispose individuals to both USH syndrome and mental disorders. Indeed, several associations between USH genes and psychiatric disorders have been reported. As an example, the <italic toggle=""yes"">CDH23</italic> gene has been linked with schizophrenia [<xref rid=""B23-audiolres-13-00086"" ref-type=""bibr"">23</xref>,<xref rid=""B29-audiolres-13-00086"" ref-type=""bibr"">29</xref>] and bipolar disorders [<xref rid=""B30-audiolres-13-00086"" ref-type=""bibr"">30</xref>]. Specifically, <italic toggle=""yes"">CDH23</italic> has been associated with a reduced PPI, typically associated with schizophrenia [<xref rid=""B23-audiolres-13-00086"" ref-type=""bibr"">23</xref>,<xref rid=""B29-audiolres-13-00086"" ref-type=""bibr"">29</xref>], and violent behaviour [<xref rid=""B26-audiolres-13-00086"" ref-type=""bibr"">26</xref>]. Further, variants within the <italic toggle=""yes"">CDH23</italic> gene were detected in patients affected by bipolar disorders [<xref rid=""B30-audiolres-13-00086"" ref-type=""bibr"">30</xref>]. To date, no studies described evidence of a direct genotype–phenotype correlation between USH patients carrying <italic toggle=""yes"">CDH23</italic> variants and mental/behavioural issues; however, considering the suddenly altered behaviour of the patient and the multiple biological functions of <italic toggle=""yes"">CDH23</italic>, it can be speculated that this gene could have a pleiotropic effect. Indeed, the concomitant onset of the two phenotypes could be explained by three hypotheses. In detail, (i) the proband’s <italic toggle=""yes"">CDH23</italic> pathogenic variant may genetically predispose him to mental disorders development; (ii) the altered <italic toggle=""yes"">CDH23</italic> function may be responsible for an alteration in neurological/brain activity; (iii) the behavioural phenotype could be ascribed to the stress associated with the progressive loss of visual acuity. In this regard, it is possible to hypothesise that the dismal onset of multiple sensory impairments could severely affect the psychological well-being of an individual. Indeed, USH patients are characterised by a double sensory deprivation, which heavily impacts their independence, social interactions, and overall quality of life. Moreover, in the case here described, the onset of the visual impairment was concomitant with the proband’s adolescence, which is a period of life notoriously associated with emotional instability and stress. However, the combined effect of all three hypotheses cannot be excluded. In particular, even if the emotional and psychological distress associated with the onset of an additional sensory defect (i.e., sight loss) is certainly significant for all patients, in some cases, it could be particularly worsened by a genetic predisposition to the development of mental disorders. This may be specifically relevant for the <italic toggle=""yes"">CDH23</italic> gene, considering that several literature reports have highlighted its role in brain functionality, and its involvement in several neuropsychiatric conditions. Therefore, there is a growing need to understand the complex interplay between the physiological and genetic factors underlying USH aetiopathogenesis, with the final goal of understanding the heterogeneous landscape of mental and behavioural disorders among USH patients. In conclusion, this study describes for the first time a possible relevant genotype–phenotype correlation between the <italic toggle=""yes"">CDH23</italic> gene, USH1, and behavioural problems. However, additional studies will be essential to clarify whether <italic toggle=""yes"">CDH23</italic> is directly responsible for behavioural issues, or if they should be ascribed to the onset of a dramatic sensorial deprivation. Further, it is possible to speculate that this novel genotype–phenotype correlation could be translated in other USH patients with altered behaviour, hypothesising that other USH genes may also have a similar pleiotropic effect. This consideration highlights the importance of carrying out additional evaluations on this poorly characterized phenotype of USH patients. In fact, the evidence here reported sheds light on the need for continuous clinical monitoring of USH patients to evaluate not only the progression of RP, but also their mental health and brain functionality.

Patients from Moorfields Eye Hospital were identified through the inherited eye disease database. Informed consent was obtained from all patients. Ethical approval was provided by the local ethics committee, and the study honored the tenets of the Declaration of Helsinki. Relevant patient data were retrieved from the electronic health care records and imaging software systems. The age of disease onset was defined as the age of the first disease related symptom(s). Snellen visual acuities were recorded and converted to logMAR for descriptive statistics. Count fingers vision was given a value of logMAR 1.98, hand motion logMAR 2.28, light perception logMAR 2.7, and no light perception logMAR 3.0.<xref rid=""bib0022"" ref-type=""bibr""><sup>22</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid=""bib0023"" ref-type=""bibr""><sup>23</sup></xref> Asymmetric best corrected visual acuity (BCVA) was defined as a difference of ≥0.3 logMAR (equivalent to 15 Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study letters) between eyes. Patients were categorized using the World Health Organization visual impairment criteria, which define no or mild visual impairment as BCVA ≤0.48 (6/18, 20/60), moderate impairment as BCVA >0.48 and ≤1.0 (6/60, 20/200), severe as BCVA >1.0 and ≤1.3 (3/60, 20/400), and blindness as BCVA >1.3. Records of visual field were very limited within our cohort; therefore, we only took into consideration BCVA to classify patients. Further clinical assessments consisted of dilated fundus examination, spectral-domain optical coherence tomography (OCT, Heidelberg Spectralis; Heidelberg Engineering, Inc, Heidelberg, Germany), fundus autofluorescence (Heidelberg Spectralis and Optos PLC, Dunfermline, UK), and ultrawide field fundus color photography (Optos PLC).

Hence, we can infer that patients carrying at least 1 missense variant can still present as USH2. Interestingly, some functional features (onset of visual symptoms and BCVA) were more severe in patients with DN genotype, whereas retinal degeneration was more visible in NDN.

PCDH15 Dual-AAV Gene Therapy for Deafness and Blindness in Usher Syndrome Type 1F
","Usher syndrome type 1F (USH1F), resulting from mutations in the protocadherin-15 (PCDH15) gene, is characterized by congenital lack of hearing and balance, and progressive blindness in the form of retinitis pigmentosa. In this study, we explore a novel approach for USH1F gene therapy, exceeding the single AAV packaging limit by employing a dual adeno-associated virus (AAV) strategy to deliver the full-length PCDH15 coding sequence. We demonstrate the efficacy of this strategy in mouse USH1F models, effectively restoring hearing and balance in these mice. Importantly, our approach also proves successful in expressing PCDH15 in clinically relevant retinal models, including human retinal organoids and non-human primate retina, showing efficient targeting of photoreceptors and proper protein expression in the calyceal processes. This research represents a major step toward advancing gene therapy for USH1F and the multiple challenges of hearing, balance, and vision impairment.",Full text not available in PMC,N/A,13 11 2023
Outcomes of cochlear implantation in Usher syndrome: a systematic review,,"Usher syndrome, also known as Hallgren syndrome, Usher-Hallgren syndrome, retinitis pigmentosa-dysacusis syndrome, and dystrophia retinae dysacusis syndrome, is an autosomal recessive hereditary ciliopathy characterized by partial or complete sensorineural hearing loss and progressive visual loss due to retinitis pigmentosa [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR1"">1</xref>]. It affects 3–6 persons per 100,000, and in the United States accounts for approximately 50% of all deaf-blindness [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR2"">2</xref>]. Mutations in at least 10 genes thought to account for Usher syndrome are present in both inner ear hair cells and retinal photoreceptors, where they lead to loss of hair cells in the cochlea and progressive loss of rod and cone photoreceptors in the retina [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR1"">1</xref>]. Most patients retain central vision of around 20/40 until age 40 [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR1"">1</xref>]. Peripheral visual losses impair the use of sign language to mitigate communication challenges in this population. Notably, auditory nerve function, gross anatomy and intellectual ability are not typically affected, making these patients good candidates for cochlear implantation. It is important that patients and their families can make an informed decision based on the best available evidence on cochlear implantation outcomes. Usher syndrome affects several aspects of a patient’s life, many of which cannot be accurately assessed by audiometric tests alone. For instance, the impact of Usher syndrome on a patient’s schooling needs to be considered when clinicians counsel patients and their families about cochlear implants and this knowledge can provide useful insight for teachers educating patients with Usher syndrome also. The use of validated Patient Reported Outcome Measures (PROMs) in measuring cochlear implant outcomes provides further insight into the effects of Usher syndrome on a patient’s quality of life and can also be a useful tool for assessing treatment effectiveness. To our knowledge, there are no systematic reviews in the literature at present that assesses the audiometric outcomes, schooling and PROMs for cochlear implants in patients with Usher syndrome. Three clinical subtypes of Usher syndrome are recognized, distinguished by severity of hearing loss, age of onset of symptoms, and vestibular involvement (Online Resource 1). Type 1 is characterized by pre-lingual hearing loss and early onset visual loss and early cochlear implantation in this group has been associated with better auditory outcomes in children with severe or profound congenital hearing loss [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR3"">3</xref>]. Pre-lingual hearing loss in type 2 is mild to severe with preservation of low-frequency hearing, often amenable to amplification by acoustic hearing aids [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR4"">4</xref>]. Type 3 is the least common, accounting for 4% of cases [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR1"">1</xref>]. Progressive sensorineural hearing loss and visual loss develop post-lingually in late childhood, adolescence, or adulthood. Acoustic hearing aids and, more uncommonly, cochlear implants are treatment options in this population, but optimal timing is unclear. Vestibular function may sometimes be negatively affected by cochlear implantation. However, there is very little evidence of implant-associated vestibular deterioration in Usher syndrome [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR5"">5</xref>].  Thirty-three publications met our inclusion and exclusion criteria after full-text screening (Fig. <xref rid=""Fig1"" ref-type=""fig"">1</xref>), representing the experiences of 187 patients with Usher syndrome and cochlear implant(s). Diagnoses included Usher type 1 (56 patients), Usher type 2 (9 patients), Usher type 3 (23 patients), and Usher of non-specified type (99 patients). 120 unilateral and 29 bilateral CI insertions were reported; five studies did not specify whether CI insertion was unilateral or bilateral (Table <xref rid=""Tab1"" ref-type=""table"">1</xref>).<fig id=""Fig1""><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>Preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses flow diagram.

medical journals. Included studies represent diverse contributions from around the world. Studies were conducted in the USA (seven), The Netherlands (five), UK (four), France (three), Saudi Arabia (three), Australia (two), Sweden (two), Brazil (one), Colombia (one), Finland (one), Germany (two), India (one), Japan (one), Spain (one), and Turkey (one). The majority (63%) were retrospective single-center case reports, case series or cohort studies. There were no randomized studies, as might be expected for severe to profound deafness. Four studies from The Netherlands were deemed likely to report from an overlapping dataset and are therefore reported together in this systematic review. This review identified post-implantation auditory and QOL outcomes for 186 patients with Usher syndrome, complementing and updating a previous systematic review on cochlear implant outcomes that included literature up to November 2019 [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR41"">41</xref>] and provides an insight into the impact of cochlear implant on patient’s schooling. Our results suggest that good audiometric and quality of life outcomes can be expected in the majority of patients with Usher types 1, 2 and 3. Our review was, however, limited by the quality of available evidence in the literature particularly for patients with Usher types 2 and 3 where only a limited number of studies reported audiometric outcomes. For patients with Usher type 1, the extent of implant success after implantation in pre-lingually deafened patients was highly variable. Much of this may be accounted for by the effect of patient age at implantation. Several studies of non-syndromic pediatric patients have identified a transition period between the ages of 24–36 months after which implantation results in relatively inferior perceptive and communicative outcomes [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR3"">3</xref>]. Amongst studies of Usher syndrome, Loundon et al. [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR29"">29</xref>] reported better perceptive results in children implanted below the age of nine years. Amongst pre-lingually deaf patients implanted as adolescents or adults, few achieved open-set speech perception [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR16"">16</xref>, <xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR18"">18</xref>, <xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR22"">22</xref>, <xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR26"">26</xref>, <xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR29"">29</xref>, <xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR33"">33</xref>, <xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR35"">35</xref>], consistent with outcomes reported from non-syndromic populations [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR42"">42</xref>]. Auditory outcomes appear similar to those of pre-lingually deaf patients with normal vision [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR3"">3</xref>, <xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR29"">29</xref>, <xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR30"">30</xref>, <xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR42"">42</xref>]. Henricson et al. [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR40"">40</xref>] found that auditory information processing performance in children with Usher type 1 was similar to that of children with normal hearing, except in tests of phonological working memory and lexical skill. In these subtests, they generally performed better than non-Usher cochlear implant users, but poorer than normal hearing and hearing aid-assisted children, likely due to the relatively earlier implantation of children with diagnosed Usher syndrome in their cohort. The improved outcomes with early implantation seen in this review suggests that genetic screening of children who are born profoundly deaf is important to enable children with Usher syndrome to be identified early and allow for effective counselling for patients and their families regarding the treatment options available. Effects on speech perception and quality of life were more consistent among post-lingually deaf patients with Usher syndrome, with all patients achieving open-set speech recognition. Auditory outcomes are similar to those reported by other studies of post-lingually deafened adults [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR43"">43</xref>]. Among post-lingually deafened adults, QOL benefit of implantation for patients with Usher syndrome was found to be comparable to that of non-Usher patients without visual deficits in two of the studies included in this review [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR21"">21</xref>, <xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR44"">44</xref>]. Rehabilitation practices were generally reported poorly, if at all. Janeschik et al. [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR10"">10</xref>] found that in the first three years after implantation, children with Usher syndrome had worse post-implant hearing outcomes compared to other children with hereditary hearing loss but at 48 months after implantation, results between the two groups were comparable. The team attributed this relatively slow improvement in auditory-oral ability to severe progressive visual loss experienced by patients with Usher syndrome. However, the number of Usher syndrome patients in the study were small and rehabilitation efforts were confounded by underlying cognitive deficits and bilingual education in the Usher syndrome group. In a separate study, Hinderink et al. [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR18"">18</xref>] identified a plateau in auditory abilities amongst one adolescent and adults with Usher type 1 beyond 12 months post-implant, consistent with studies of non-syndromic pre-lingually deaf adolescents and adults [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR45"">45</xref>, <xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR46"">46</xref>]. None of the studies included in this review identified any correlation between the genotype and post-implantation outcomes. Reported outcome data were sufficiently heterogenous as to preclude meta-analysis of auditory outcomes and quality of life with respect to age at implantation or visual impairment. Eight studies [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR12"">12</xref>, <xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR17"">17</xref>–<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR19"">19</xref>, <xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR22"">22</xref>, <xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR36"">36</xref>–<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR38"">38</xref>] reported educational placement. As recent changes in public policy favor the integration of children with disabilities into mainstream schools where patients are more likely to achieve language development comparable to that of normal-hearing peers [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR47"">47</xref>], the extent of language development reported may be an underestimation of contemporary outcomes in children with Usher syndrome and cochlear implants. Whilst several studies report of individual cases that have successfully enrolled at mainstream schools, no studies report both pre- and post- implantation educational placement for the same patient cohort. This highlights a gap in the published literature of whether cochlear implantation not only improves audiometric outcomes but whether this translates into improvements in educational outcomes. The seven studies identified in this review that reported on QOL measures would suggest improvements in educational outcomes to be present as improvements in QOL post-implantation were found in the majority of cases. There was, however, data that suggested that general QOL negatively correlated with age of implantation and speech perception among patients with Usher type 1 [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR30"">30</xref>]. As cochlear implant costs are estimated to be over $1 million US dollars over a lifetime [<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR48"">48</xref>], further research into quantifying educational outcomes post-cochlear implantation in this population may be useful for policy makers, clinicians and patients/parents in making an informed decision regarding cochlear implantation. The modest quality of included studies is a limitation of this review that reflects the low prevalence of Usher syndrome in the general population and varied reporting practices. Though not possible to quantify, we suspect that some reporting bias in favor of extreme results will be present, particularly among case studies and smaller case series. Future studies would benefit from the use of standardized international reporting measures for auditory outcomes and quality of life, and systematic reporting of educational placement, communication preferences, and educational attainment. Studies should also report data regarding non-implanted patients with Usher syndrome assessed at their center to better determine the representativeness of the implanted cohort. Multi-center collaboration may identify larger cohorts of patients with Usher syndrome, from which more confident estimations of effect may be inferred. Where reported, cochlear implantation was found to be beneficial in improving sound detection, speech perception, speech intelligibility, and quality of life in the majority of patients with Usher syndrome. As clinical practice has evolved to emphasize early, bilateral implantation and access to oral education it is likely that the outcomes reported in this systematic review underestimate the potential benefits of cochlear implantation among young children with Usher syndrome. Clearly, early identification and implantation is even more important in the prelingually deaf Usher group, as they are likely to proceed to visual loss in time, with resulting multisensory deficits if cochlear implant outcomes are poor due to late implantation.

Combined Presence in Heterozygosis of Two Variant Usher Syndrome Genes in Two Siblings Affected by Isolated Profound Age-Related Hearing Loss,"Sensorineural age-related hearing loss affects a large proportion of the elderly population, and has both environmental and genetic causes. Notwithstanding increasing interest in this debilitating condition, the genetic risk factors remain largely unknown. Here, we report the case of two sisters affected by isolated profound sensorineural hearing loss after the age of seventy. Genomic DNA sequencing revealed that the siblings shared two monoallelic variants in two genes linked to Usher Syndrome (<italic toggle=""yes"">USH</italic> genes), a recessive disorder of the ear and the retina: a rare pathogenic truncating variant in <italic toggle=""yes"">USH1G</italic> and a previously unreported missense variant in <italic toggle=""yes"">ADGRV1</italic>. Structure predictions suggest a negative effect on protein stability of the latter variant, allowing its classification as likely pathogenic according to American College of Medical Genetics criteria. Thus, the presence in heterozygosis of two recessive alleles, which each cause syndromic deafness, may underlie digenic inheritance of the age-related non-syndromic hearing loss of the siblings, a hypothesis that is strengthened by the knowledge that the two genes are integrated in the same functional network, which underlies stereocilium development and organization. These results enlarge the spectrum and complexity of the phenotypic consequences of <italic toggle=""yes"">USH</italic> gene mutations beyond the simple Mendelian inheritance of classical Usher syndrome.","Sensorineural age-related hearing loss (ARHL), a condition caused by inner ear damage, affects a large proportion of the elderly population (World Health Organization <uri http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink href=""https://www.who.int/health-topics/hearing-loss#tab=tab_1"">https://www.who.int/health-topics/hearing-loss#tab=tab_1</uri> (accessed on 29 March 2023)) [<xref rid=""B1-biomedicines-11-02657"" ref-type=""bibr"">1</xref>,<xref rid=""B2-biomedicines-11-02657"" ref-type=""bibr"">2</xref>], and depending on the degree of severity, it may lead to social isolation, cognitive deficits and/or depression [<xref rid=""B3-biomedicines-11-02657"" ref-type=""bibr"">3</xref>]. Both environmental and genetic risk factors underlie this disability, and the latter’s contribution is estimated at 35–70% in different studies (reviewed in [<xref rid=""B4-biomedicines-11-02657"" ref-type=""bibr"">4</xref>]). Given the recognized genetic basis of ARHL, a number of large-scale population studies have been carried out with the aim of identifying genetic risk factors ([<xref rid=""B5-biomedicines-11-02657"" ref-type=""bibr"">5</xref>] and references therein; reviewed in [<xref rid=""B4-biomedicines-11-02657"" ref-type=""bibr"">4</xref>,<xref rid=""B6-biomedicines-11-02657"" ref-type=""bibr"">6</xref>,<xref rid=""B7-biomedicines-11-02657"" ref-type=""bibr"">7</xref>]). The general conclusion of these studies is that ARHL is a complex, highly heterogeneous, and polygenic pathology [<xref rid=""B8-biomedicines-11-02657"" ref-type=""bibr"">8</xref>], and that the unequivocally identified genetic risk factors linked to ARHL explain only a portion of the estimated heritability. Two hypotheses to explain the modest outcome of Genome-Wide Association Studies (GWAS) are (i) that ARHL risk could be due to the additive genetic burden of a large number of variants [<xref rid=""B8-biomedicines-11-02657"" ref-type=""bibr"">8</xref>], each with a small effect, or (ii) that it could be due to a limited number of very rare variants with large effect. Given the heterogeneity of ARHL, both these scenarios may be relevant, and both would escape detection by GWAS, even with very large cohort sizes. To overcome the limitations of GWAS analyses (discussed in recent reviews [<xref rid=""B6-biomedicines-11-02657"" ref-type=""bibr"">6</xref>,<xref rid=""B7-biomedicines-11-02657"" ref-type=""bibr"">7</xref>]), whole exome sequencing has recently been applied to ARHL population studies [<xref rid=""B5-biomedicines-11-02657"" ref-type=""bibr"">5</xref>,<xref rid=""B9-biomedicines-11-02657"" ref-type=""bibr"">9</xref>,<xref rid=""B10-biomedicines-11-02657"" ref-type=""bibr"">10</xref>]. These studies have uncovered novel candidate genes, among which there are a number of rare, large-effect variants. Very interestingly, Mendelian hearing loss genes were among the rare variants, indicating that different mutations of the same gene may either be monogenically involved in syndromic deafness or constitute a risk factor for adult-onset hearing loss [<xref rid=""B5-biomedicines-11-02657"" ref-type=""bibr"">5</xref>,<xref rid=""B10-biomedicines-11-02657"" ref-type=""bibr"">10</xref>]. These results are consistent with a highly polygenic genetic architecture displaying a shared etiology between Mendelian and complex inheritance, with rare and common variants contributing to the ARHL risk. Given the high prevalence of ARHL (estimated at 50% of people over 75 years of age-[<xref rid=""B11-biomedicines-11-02657"" ref-type=""bibr"">11</xref>]) and its consequent social cost, a complete understanding of the genetic basis of this heterogeneous pathology is an important goal that could lead to the development of pharmacological and/or cell-based therapies. Attainment of this goal will require further large-scale population analyses and animal studies, as well as investigations of single individuals or families. Our current study contributes to the latter group of investigations: we report the case of two siblings affected by progressive high frequency hearing loss, which they noted in their middle-age, and which culminated in profound hearing loss in their seventies. Genetic analysis revealed that both siblings are heterozygotes for variants of two genes that are linked to Usher syndrome. This is a rare autosomal recessive disorder associated with sensorineural hearing impairment at birth, later progressive visual loss due to retinitis pigmentosa, and sometimes vestibular dysfunction [<xref rid=""B12-biomedicines-11-02657"" ref-type=""bibr"">12</xref>,<xref rid=""B13-biomedicines-11-02657"" ref-type=""bibr"">13</xref>]. Three genetic subtypes of this syndrome, linked to sixteen loci and thirteen identified genes, are currently recognized [<xref rid=""B14-biomedicines-11-02657"" ref-type=""bibr"">14</xref>]. Our investigation revealed in both the proband and her sister a very rare truncating variant in <italic toggle=""yes"">USH1G</italic> and a previously undescribed missense substitution in <italic toggle=""yes"">ADGRV1</italic>, two genes linked to type I (OMIM 606943) and type II (OMIM 605472) Usher syndrome, respectively. The protein products of the two genes belong to the same functional network, which is involved in stereocilium biogenesis, hair bundle organization, and mechanoelectrical transduction in the auditory receptor cells of the inner ear [<xref rid=""B15-biomedicines-11-02657"" ref-type=""bibr"">15</xref>], and we suggest that the two defective alleles may act additively to produce the debilitating deafness of the two siblings.   We report here the simultaneous presence in heterozygosis of a pathogenic and a likely pathogenic variant in two Usher-syndrome-linked genes in two siblings affected by progressive severe to profound sensorial hearing loss after the age of seventy. Although Usher Syndrome is a recessively inherited disease, we consider it likely that the combined presence of the two variants underlies the profound ARHL reported here. Indeed, the <italic toggle=""yes"">USH1G</italic> and the <italic toggle=""yes"">ADGRV1</italic> gene products belong to the same functional network involved in stereocilium organization and function in cochlear hair cells, and in retinal photoreceptors [<xref rid=""B15-biomedicines-11-02657"" ref-type=""bibr"">15</xref>,<xref rid=""B47-biomedicines-11-02657"" ref-type=""bibr"">47</xref>]. As illustrated in <xref rid=""biomedicines-11-02657-f006"" ref-type=""fig"">Figure 6</xref>, string analysis with <italic toggle=""yes"">USH1G</italic> as the query places the two proteins in the same protein network (<xref rid=""biomedicines-11-02657-f006"" ref-type=""fig"">Figure 6</xref>A), and Gene Ontology enrichment analysis shows them to be involved in common pathways (<xref rid=""biomedicines-11-02657-f006"" ref-type=""fig"">Figure 6</xref>B). The USH protein network consists of multiprotein complexes that integrate cell adhesion molecules (among which ADGRV1) with intracellular scaffolding proteins (among which SANS) and, via unconventional Myosin 7A, with the actin cytoskeleton. In this way, intercilium adhesion is coupled to the rigid actin filament core of stereocilia, and the striking architecture of cochlear auditory receptor hair bundles is generated (reviewed in [<xref rid=""B15-biomedicines-11-02657"" ref-type=""bibr"">15</xref>,<xref rid=""B48-biomedicines-11-02657"" ref-type=""bibr"">48</xref>]). Although ADGRV1’s function has been best characterized in intercilium ankle links [<xref rid=""B49-biomedicines-11-02657"" ref-type=""bibr"">49</xref>] and SANS is known to be essential for the tip links [<xref rid=""B27-biomedicines-11-02657"" ref-type=""bibr"">27</xref>,<xref rid=""B28-biomedicines-11-02657"" ref-type=""bibr"">28</xref>], all Usher proteins can essentially directly or indirectly interact with each other via their PDZ domains and PDZ interacting motifs [<xref rid=""B50-biomedicines-11-02657"" ref-type=""bibr"">50</xref>]. Ankle links are transient structures that, in mice, are no longer present at P12 [<xref rid=""B49-biomedicines-11-02657"" ref-type=""bibr"">49</xref>]; however, ADGRV1 has been detected in the stereocilia of the adult cochlea and ADGRV1 and SANS co-localize to the ribbon synapses of hair cells too [<xref rid=""B51-biomedicines-11-02657"" ref-type=""bibr"">51</xref>]. Importantly, biochemical analysis of an Usher protein complex located between the inner and outer segments of mammalian photoreceptors directly demonstrated a physical interaction between SANS and ADGRV1 mediated by the scaffolding protein whirlin (USH2D) [<xref rid=""B47-biomedicines-11-02657"" ref-type=""bibr"">47</xref>]. Thus, the participation of the two genes in shared pathways (<xref rid=""biomedicines-11-02657-f006"" ref-type=""fig"">Figure 6</xref>B) could result in mutual dependency of each one on the other’s dosage, and the phenotypic effects reported here could be explained by the phenomenon of combined or complex haploinsufficiency [<xref rid=""B52-biomedicines-11-02657"" ref-type=""bibr"">52</xref>]. So far, we have not identified additional families with isolated ARHL associated with this kind of digenic inheritance, nor have patients with this combination of gene defects been reported by others. Nevertheless, in support of our hypothesis is the well-documented case of digenic inheritance of Type II Usher syndrome in a subject carrying heterozygous frameshift mutations in the <italic toggle=""yes"">ADGRV1</italic> and the <italic toggle=""yes"">PDZD7</italic> (OMIM 612971) modifier genes [<xref rid=""B53-biomedicines-11-02657"" ref-type=""bibr"">53</xref>]; additionally, cases of likely digenic inheritance involving combinations of monoallelic variants of USH1 and USH2-linked genes have been reported as well [<xref rid=""B43-biomedicines-11-02657"" ref-type=""bibr"">43</xref>]. Usher syndrome is classically a combined disorder of the retina and the cochlea; however, neither of the two siblings of the present report presented visual problems, other than those normally associated with age (cataract). This is not surprising, as Usher Syndrome retinal pathology is variable and of later onset than hearing loss [<xref rid=""B54-biomedicines-11-02657"" ref-type=""bibr"">54</xref>]. Furthermore, different mutations of USH genes may be linked to non-syndromic deafness and not to full-blown Usher syndrome [<xref rid=""B12-biomedicines-11-02657"" ref-type=""bibr"">12</xref>,<xref rid=""B55-biomedicines-11-02657"" ref-type=""bibr"">55</xref>]. Indeed, of the SANS and ADGRV1 mutations listed in the Human Gene Mutation Database (<uri http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink href=""https://digitalinsights.qiagen.com/products-overview/clinical-insights-portfolio/human-gene-mutation-database/"">https://digitalinsights.qiagen.com/products-overview/clinical-insights-portfolio/human-gene-mutation-database/</uri> (accessed on 9 March 2023)), more are reported as being linked to isolated deafness than to Usher Syndrome. The current study was limited to two siblings affected by near complete hearing loss, as other family members were not available for genetic testing. The father and mother (deceased at the time of this study) died at the ages of seventy and of eighty three, respectively, and neither of them ever complained of hearing problems. To the knowledge of the siblings, there were no other reports of severe hearing loss among known relatives. Thus, a likely scenario is that each of the two variant alleles was carried in heterozygosis by a single parent, and that the siblings received one variant from each parent. In conclusion, our study reveals a novel genetic basis for the progressive severe to profound sensory deafness of two siblings, confirming the complexity of genotype–phenotype correlations of <italic toggle=""yes"">USH</italic> genes, and providing a previously undescribed example of digenic inheritance of ARHL. Hopefully, the case reported here will provide a useful addition to the growing number of investigations into the risk factors and genetics of this debilitating condition.",N/A,28 9 2023
Clinical Presentation of Usher Syndrome Type 1B (USH1B) in a 10-Month-Old: A Case Report,"<italic toggle=""yes"">Usher Syndrome (USH)</italic> is a genetically inherited condition characterized by congenital sensorineural hearing loss and progressive vision loss secondary to retinitis pigmentosa. Patients may also display vestibular areflexia and balance issues secondary to inner ear damage. Usher Syndrome is the most commonly diagnosed syndrome within the blind-deaf community, and it accounts for a significant portion of the hearing and visual deficit cases among patients younger than 65 years of age. Due to the reported prevalence of Usher Syndrome in the United States, it appears there is chronic underdiagnosis in clinical settings throughout the country. A possible explanation for this is the visual deficits of Usher syndrome do not appear until later in life and thus inappropriately lower the index of suspicion for this diagnosis in young children with hearing deficits. This case study highlights a healthy newborn who failed the universal newborn hearing screening (UNHS) bilaterally and a follow-up hearing screening in a pediatrician's office. Auditory brainstem response (ABR) later confirmed bilateral severe-to-profound sensorineural hearing loss. Upon genetic testing, an abnormality in the Unconventional Myosin VII-A (MYO7) gene was discovered and consistent with Usher syndrome Type 1B (USH1B). Usher Syndrome should be considered on the differential for patients with congenital hearing loss. Genetic counseling should be used if no other cause of sensorineural hearing loss is identified. Due to the progressive nature of this condition and the physical and developmental deficits that will transpire without treatment, a genetic panel for hearing loss should be prioritized to determine the presence of genetic mutations suggesting Usher syndrome.","Usher Syndrome (USH) is the most common cause of syndromic hearing loss after Pendred syndrome and is categorized into three clinical types with 14 subtypes, following causative mutations in different genes and loci [<xref rid=""REF1"" ref-type=""bibr"">1</xref>,<xref rid=""REF2"" ref-type=""bibr"">2</xref>]. Despite these impressive statistics, Usher Syndrome has an estimated prevalence of only 0.0044% in the United States, suggesting chronic underdiagnosis in clinical settings [<xref rid=""REF1"" ref-type=""bibr"">1</xref>]. The sensory deficits of this condition are secondary to profound bilateral sensorineural hearing loss and retinitis pigmentosa, respectively [<xref rid=""REF2"" ref-type=""bibr"">2</xref>,<xref rid=""REF3"" ref-type=""bibr"">3</xref>]. It is believed ""far senses"" [hearing and vision] are necessary to participate in the complexities of human communication [<xref rid=""REF1"" ref-type=""bibr"">1</xref>,<xref rid=""REF4"" ref-type=""bibr"">4</xref>]. In the absence of one, the remaining sense will compensate to preserve function; however, when both senses are compromised, the ""near senses"" [smell, taste, and tactility] will augment but fall short of complete compensation [<xref rid=""REF1"" ref-type=""bibr"">1</xref>,<xref rid=""REF4"" ref-type=""bibr"">4</xref>]. With this in mind, deaf-blindness as a combined disability is immensely debilitating and greatly limits available activities and societal participation with lasting effects in ""social life, communication, access to information, orientation, and the ability to move around freely and safely [<xref rid=""REF1"" ref-type=""bibr"">1</xref>]."" In addition to hearing and visual loss, many patients with this syndrome have concomitant bilateral vestibular areflexia [<xref rid=""REF1"" ref-type=""bibr"">1</xref>]. The vestibular system consists of two organs: the two otolith organs [utricle and saccule] and the three semicircular canals [anterior, posterior, and horizontal], which detect linear acceleration and rotational acceleration, respectively [<xref rid=""REF5"" ref-type=""bibr"">5</xref>]. The sensations from these organs are complex and constant, yet they operate entirely subconsciously in light of the lack of a perceivable sensation [<xref rid=""REF5"" ref-type=""bibr"">5</xref>]. A genetic condition marked by vestibular areflexia will naturally manifest as balance abnormalities in affected patients [<xref rid=""REF1"" ref-type=""bibr"">1</xref>,<xref rid=""REF3"" ref-type=""bibr"">3</xref>].  In developed nations, Usher Syndrome is primarily diagnosed in pediatric populations. This results from both legislative mandates, which vary from state to state, and subsequent access and ability to readily perform the Universal Newborn Hearing Screening (UNHS) on every newborn [<xref rid=""REF6"" ref-type=""bibr"">6</xref>]. Initially, a patient will clinically present with some degree of perceived hearing loss, a finding usually reported by a parent or caretaker. The Early Hearing Detection and Intervention (EDHI) guidelines [<xref rid=""REF7"" ref-type=""bibr"">7</xref>], published by the Joint Committee on Infant Hearing (JCIH), propose a timeline to understand better the clinical approach to sensorineural hearing loss [<xref rid=""REF8"" ref-type=""bibr"">8</xref>]. In the United States, sensorineural hearing loss occurs in 0.2% to 0.4% of live births, affecting up to 40,000 children annually, two-thirds of whom experience bilateral hearing compromise [<xref rid=""REF9"" ref-type=""bibr"">9</xref>,<xref rid=""REF10"" ref-type=""bibr"">10</xref>]. The guidelines dictate an assignment of a medical home at birth with immediate completion of the UNHS or rescreening by one month of age [<xref rid=""REF8"" ref-type=""bibr"">8</xref>]. If this assessment is failed, the patient should be referred for pediatric audiology assessment by 2 to 3 months of age, enrolled in their residing states' First Steps/Early Intervention Program (as allotted by the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act-Part C) [<xref rid=""REF11"" ref-type=""bibr"">11</xref>] and referred to an otolaryngologist by 3 to 6 months of age [<xref rid=""REF8"" ref-type=""bibr"">8</xref>]. It is also encouraged to schedule follow up with ophthalmology and genetic specialists; however, timelines for these specialties are not included in the current guidelines [<xref rid=""REF7"" ref-type=""bibr"">7</xref>,<xref rid=""REF8"" ref-type=""bibr"">8</xref>]. The next clinical progression in Usher Syndrome is progressive blindness due to retinitis pigmentosa. This is usually adolescent-onset and involves a progressive, bilateral, and symmetric degeneration of the retina's rod and cone functional cells [<xref rid=""REF3"" ref-type=""bibr"">3</xref>]. Distinctive pigments are left behind as the retina degenerates, giving this condition its name [<xref rid=""REF1"" ref-type=""bibr"">1</xref>]. Research shows the cellular basis of this condition is the result of compromised photoreceptors, retinal pigment epithelial cells, and Müller cells [<xref rid=""REF12"" ref-type=""bibr"">12</xref>-<xref rid=""REF14"" ref-type=""bibr"">14</xref>]. The eye's rods are affected first, leading to an inability to see in darkness, then degeneration of the cones will start at the periphery and work centrally, progressing from ""tunnel vision"" to complete visual compromise [<xref rid=""REF13"" ref-type=""bibr"">13</xref>]. Research into Usher Syndrome has identified up to nine causative genes and at least 12 chromosomal loci as potential sources of disease [<xref rid=""REF1"" ref-type=""bibr"">1</xref>,<xref rid=""REF15"" ref-type=""bibr"">15</xref>]. Naturally, these genes correspond to a protein, most belonging to different protein classes and families [<xref rid=""REF15"" ref-type=""bibr"">15</xref>]. USH seems to interfere exclusively with sensory cells that express actin filaments in specific segments. This may explain why the disease essentially affects the eyes and ears [<xref rid=""REF1"" ref-type=""bibr"">1</xref>]. The actual defect lies within the structural and functional proteins of neural crest cells that compose both the inner ear and the retina [<xref rid=""REF1"" ref-type=""bibr"">1</xref>,<xref rid=""REF2"" ref-type=""bibr"">2</xref>]. Additionally, because the cochlea and vestibular apparatus originate from neural crest tissue, which becomes the otic vesicle, Usher Syndrome patients are more likely to present ataxic symptoms [<xref rid=""REF16"" ref-type=""bibr"">16</xref>]. Progressive damage to the vestibular system and the more apparent inner ear damage may give another clinical indication that the patient has Usher Syndrome [<xref rid=""REF2"" ref-type=""bibr"">2</xref>,<xref rid=""REF17"" ref-type=""bibr"">17</xref>].  For a diagnosis of Usher Syndrome, both copies of the responsible gene must be deficient for the condition to arise, in line with its autosomal recessive inheritance pattern. It should be noted that digenic, bi-allelic, and polygenic forms of this condition have also been reported, in addition to dominant or nonsyndromic forms of genetic mutations [<xref rid=""REF1"" ref-type=""bibr"">1</xref>]. Despite symptoms following the distribution and expression of different proteins in different organs, the variability in the expression of similar dysfunctions can be remarkable, even among siblings. Penetrance is considered about 100% for all types, with the most severe forms (USH1) being characterized by congenital profound sensory hearing loss, bilateral vestibular areflexia, and early onset of retinitis pigmentosa (RP) [<xref rid=""REF3"" ref-type=""bibr"">3</xref>]. Genetic counseling is the next best step if clinical features fail to secure a diagnosis [<xref rid=""REF3"" ref-type=""bibr"">3</xref>]. Research shows a plethora of potential causes for this condition; thus, Usher Syndrome has been divided into three clinical types: 1, 2, and 3 (USH1, USH2, USH3) identified by clinical investigation, and different subtypes correspond to different genes, identified by genetic investigation. They are clinically divided based on several criteria: the severity of hearing loss, the onset of retinitis pigmentosa, and the presence of vestibular disturbance [<xref rid=""REF18"" ref-type=""bibr"">18</xref>,<xref rid=""REF19"" ref-type=""bibr"">19</xref>]. However, genetic investigations are essential to confirm or reject the clinical diagnosis. It is divided into 14 subtypes based on the specific gene mutation [<xref rid=""REF19"" ref-type=""bibr"">19</xref>]. USH1 is responsible for about one-third to one-half of cases and is considered to be the most severe of the three, being marked by non-progressive profound to severe congenital bilateral sensorineural hearing loss, near complete vestibular areflexia, and the pre-pubertal onset of retinitis pigmentosa [<xref rid=""REF1"" ref-type=""bibr"">1</xref>,<xref rid=""REF18"" ref-type=""bibr"">18</xref>,<xref rid=""REF19"" ref-type=""bibr"">19</xref>]. Most patients with Usher Syndrome require a collaboration of specialties to ensure proper development. For example, without using cochlear implants (with or without previous use of hearing aids), patients will likely fail to develop speech, and delayed introduction of sign language and tactile forms of learning [braille] can compromise the patient's ability to interact as they age. An absence of vestibular compensation therapies can promote life-long balance complications [<xref rid=""REF3"" ref-type=""bibr"">3</xref>]. A close medical relationship will be needed throughout the patient's life, and requirements will only increase as the patient's condition develops [<xref rid=""REF1"" ref-type=""bibr"">1</xref>,<xref rid=""REF3"" ref-type=""bibr"">3</xref>]. A healthy newborn female, born via spontaneous vaginal delivery to a G2P1001 female with 1-minute and 5-minute APGAR scores of 8 and 9, respectively, underwent all necessary neonatal care and prophylaxis according to protocol. Included in this care was the UNHS, which the patient failed bilaterally. No further postpartum complications were encountered, and they were discharged at 48 hours of age. The patient's parents were advised to follow up with a pediatrician to reevaluate the patient's hearing.  At four days of age, the patient was taken to the pediatrician, where the parents raised additional concerns. They reported that the infant did not appear to respond to any sound, using the barking of the family dogs as an example. The patient's hearing was then reevaluated at one month of age, which resulted in another bilateral failure. With no gross abnormalities noted on the otoscopic examination, it was determined that the infant would need further evaluation by a pediatric otolaryngologist (ENT) to determine the potential cause and to categorize the severity of the infant's hearing loss, upon referral to ENT, another otoscope exam determined patent external auditory canals with a normal appearing tympanic membrane. A high-frequency tympanogram determined there were no middle ear abnormalities. Auditory Brainstem Response (ABR) testing confirmed bilateral severe-to-profound sensorineural hearing loss.  To prevent any delays in milestones, the patient was scheduled to receive cochlear implants, and speech therapy was recommended. With no other complaints or obvious causes, a geneticist was consulted to determine if an underlying genetic abnormality would explain her sensorineural hearing loss. While awaiting genetic testing, the patient was found to be mildly hypotonic at her four-month checkup, failing to meet major motor milestones such as rolling from prone. At six months, parents reported the infant could not roll and had difficulty sitting up with support. At nine months, the patient showed developmental milestones more consistent with a 5-6-month-old. Genetic testing revealed that the child carried two variants of uncertain significance in the Unconventional Myosin VII-A (MYO7A) gene, consistent with Usher Syndrome.  These MYO7A gene variants were confirmed to be on opposite chromosomes, and the laboratory upgraded one of the variants from ""uncertain significance"" to ""likely pathogenic."" Although one variant of the patient's MYO7A gene remains of ""uncertain significance,"" the variant has been identified in other patients with Usher Syndrome, and the geneticist anticipates this variant to be upgraded in the future. The patient's diagnosis remains a clinical diagnosis based on the pathogenic variant of the MYO7A gene and her clinical presentation. With the diagnosis of Usher Syndrome being confirmed, the pediatrician referred the patient to a pediatric specialist to better assess and manage the deficits associated with this condition. An ears, nose, and throat specialist continued management of the cochlear implants. An ophthalmologist was consulted for the management of ocular deficits. A neurology referral was given to assess the vestibular deficits, most likely delaying the patient's motor coordination. Finally, physical and speech therapy were consulted for motor and speech deficits. Genetic counseling was also provided for the parents. Geneticists gave them the information moving forward if they were to have another child and the probability of that child being diagnosed with Usher Syndrome. Together with the specialist, the pediatrician has started the patient on a treatment plan to ensure the quality of life is prioritized.  Genetic testing should be prioritized if a pediatrician or general practitioner suspects Usher Syndrome. Table <xref rid=""TAB1"" ref-type=""table"">1</xref> shows several known genetic causes for this condition, furthering the importance of early and accurate genetic screening. Early genetic testing was initiated in this case, and the MYO7A gene mutation was identified, leading to the diagnosis of USH1B, the most severe form of Usher Syndrome. With these patients developing severe hearing loss, equilibrium disorders, and early onset retinitis pigmentosa, physicians must have a broad differential that includes Usher Syndrome when a newborn patient fails a hearing screening. Due to the varying degree of clinical presentations and the rarity of Usher Syndrome, it is suspected that many mild forms have gone undiagnosed or been incorrectly diagnosed [<xref rid=""REF1"" ref-type=""bibr"">1</xref>]. The diagnosis is important because of the delay in speech and language development due to hearing loss and the potential walking delays and ataxic difficulties that may result from vestibular abnormalities [<xref rid=""REF2"" ref-type=""bibr"">2</xref>]. Physicians should be suspected of Usher Syndrome if an infant presents with sensorineural hearing loss and failure to walk, and no other diagnoses have been made. These are good clinical indicators a child could have Usher Syndrome, and genetic counseling should be sought for further investigation [<xref rid=""REF2"" ref-type=""bibr"">2</xref>]. Physician intervention is a priority for these patients to ensure the child gets the necessary medical interventions that are required to ensure developmental milestones are met. Hearing aids may suffice, but cochlear implants may be required as definitive treatment. Neurology should also be consulted for vestibular dysfunction, and an ophthalmologist to continue monitoring for retinal degeneration, cataracts, and/or cystoid macular edema [<xref rid=""REF18"" ref-type=""bibr"">18</xref>]. Physical therapy should be readily available for these patients and should be tailored to the patient's degree of vestibular dysfunction. Speech therapy should be initiated at a young age to mitigate developmental deficits. In total, Usher Syndrome is believed to be the most common heritable form of combined hearing and visual loss across populations. This case study follows a newborn female who failed her UNHS bilaterally in the neonatal period and at her 1-month follow-up appointment. Following a genetic workup, this patient was ultimately found to have genetic abnormalities associated with the most severe form of Usher Syndrome, USH1B. Although her diagnosis remains clinical at this time, this is believed to change secondary to the results of her genetic analysis. Ultimately, pediatric and general practitioners must keep Usher Syndrome on their differential diagnosis when a young patient presents with sensorineural hearing loss. These patients will require ample medical resources and specialty visits as their condition continues to progress, and the earlier these deficits are detected, the better the overall prognosis for the patient at hand.",N/A,22 8 2023
"Dual-AAV vector-mediated expression of <italic toggle=""yes"">MYO7A</italic> improves vestibular function in a mouse model of Usher syndrome 1B","Usher syndrome is the most common cause of deafness-blindness in the world. Usher syndrome type 1B (USH1B) is associated with mutations in <italic toggle=""yes"">MYO7A</italic>. Patients with USH1B experience deafness, blindness, and vestibular dysfunction. In this study, we applied adeno-associated virus (AAV)-mediated gene therapy to the shaker-1 (<italic toggle=""yes"">Myo7a</italic><sup><italic toggle=""yes"">4626SB/4626SB</italic></sup>) mouse, a model of USH1B. The shaker-1 mouse has a nonsense mutation in <italic toggle=""yes"">Myo7a</italic>, is profoundly deaf throughout life, and has significant vestibular dysfunction. Because of the ∼6.7-kb size of the <italic toggle=""yes"">MYO7A</italic> cDNA, a dual-AAV approach was used for gene delivery, which involves splitting human <italic toggle=""yes"">MYO7A</italic> cDNA into 5′ and 3′ halves and cloning them into two separate AAV8(Y733F) vectors. When <italic toggle=""yes"">MYO7A</italic> cDNA was delivered to shaker-1 inner ears using the dual-AAV approach, cochlear hair cell survival was improved. However, stereocilium organization and auditory function were not improved. In contrast, in the vestibular system, dual-AAV-mediated <italic toggle=""yes"">MYO7A</italic> delivery significantly rescued hair cell stereocilium morphology and improved vestibular function, as reflected in a reduction of circling behavior and improved vestibular sensory-evoked potential (VsEP) thresholds.

In addition, sub-retinal injection of the hybrid dual-AAV vectors carrying human <italic toggle=""yes"">MYO7A</italic> cDNA into a <italic toggle=""yes"">Myo7a</italic> mutant mouse (shaker-1, <italic toggle=""yes"">Myo7a</italic><sup><italic toggle=""yes"">4626SB/4626SB</italic></sup>) resulted in expression of full-length human MYO7A and improvement of melanosome and rhodopsin localization in the mouse retina.<xref rid=""bib14"" ref-type=""bibr""><sup>14</sup></xref> In this study, we asked whether hybrid dual-AAV vectors could mediate sufficient levels of full-length MYO7A expression in the inner ear of the shaker-1 mouse model for USH1B.

USH is a genetic disease that has a profound impact on a patient’s quality of life, particularly those who have type 1 USH, such as USH1B. While patients with USH1B often have profound hearing loss and visual loss, they also experience vestibular dysfunction, which can significantly increase their risk for fall-related injuries. Therefore, our study investigated the effect of gene replacement therapy as a treatment for auditory and vestibular dysfunction in a mouse model of USH1B, the shaker-1 mouse. The shaker-1 mouse (<italic toggle=""yes"">Myo7a</italic><sup><italic toggle=""yes"">4626SB/4626SB</italic></sup>) was generated using N-ethyl-N-nitrosourea (ENU) mutagenesis, which resulted in a premature stop codon (NM_001256081).<xref rid=""bib17"" ref-type=""bibr""><sup>17</sup></xref> In mice, the 4626SB mutation in <italic toggle=""yes"">Myo7a</italic> has been shown to cause abnormal hair cell stereocilium bundle morphology.<xref rid=""bib26"" ref-type=""bibr""><sup>26</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid=""bib27"" ref-type=""bibr""><sup>27</sup></xref> Consequently, shaker-1 mice have profound deafness and vestibular dysfunction. Therefore, the inner ear of the shaker-1 mouse is a good model for USH1B because patients with USH1B also demonstrate profound hearing loss and vestibular dysfunction. The dual-AAV vector-based approach has been successfully applied in the mouse inner ear. Previously, two studies have shown that the dual-AAV vectors are capable of delivering the otoferlin protein in a DFNB9 mouse model.<xref rid=""bib12"" ref-type=""bibr""><sup>12</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid=""bib28"" ref-type=""bibr""><sup>28</sup></xref> Otoferlin is involved in calcium ion binding activity and synaptic vesicle trafficking.<xref rid=""bib29"" ref-type=""bibr""><sup>29</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid=""bib30"" ref-type=""bibr""><sup>30</sup></xref> Dual-AAV vectors can produce a recombinant full-length otoferlin protein in cells co-infected with 5′ and 3′ vectors, thus restoring otoferlin expression in the inner ear.<xref rid=""bib12"" ref-type=""bibr""><sup>12</sup></xref> Similarly, it has been found that injection of dual-AAV-otoferlin vectors partially restores synaptic function in mutant mice.<xref rid=""bib28"" ref-type=""bibr""><sup>28</sup></xref> These studies also demonstrated that the dual-AAV vector-based approach improves hearing in a DFNB9 mouse model and corrects profound deafness.<xref rid=""bib12"" ref-type=""bibr""><sup>12</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid=""bib28"" ref-type=""bibr""><sup>28</sup></xref> Furthermore, it has been shown that dual-AAV vectors can prolong hearing recovery over a sustained time period.

In this study, we applied the dual-AAV vector-based approach to deliver human <italic toggle=""yes"">MYO7A</italic> cDNA into the shaker-1 mouse inner ear. The dual-AAV vectors we used in this study have been shown to restore MYO7A expression in the mouse retina following sub-retinal injection.<xref rid=""bib19"" ref-type=""bibr""><sup>19</sup></xref> We injected the dual-AAV8(Y733F)-<italic toggle=""yes"">MYO7A</italic> vectors into the inner ear of neonatal shaker-1 mice using the PSC approach. This resulted in successful transduction of IHCs and OHCs in the cochlea. We observed that shaker-1 mice treated with these dual-AAV vectors had improved cochlear hair cell survival, and many of the surviving hair cells expressed MYO7A. This contrasts with the untreated shaker-1 mice that have severe cochlear hair cell degeneration. We also quantified the transduction rates of IHCs and OHCs in the treated animals and found that the transduction rate was higher at the apex than at the base of the cochlea. The lower transduction rate at the cochlear base may in part be due to the fact that cochlear hair cell degeneration is most profound at the cochlear base. Taken together, these results show that dual-AAV8(Y733F)-<italic toggle=""yes"">MYO7A</italic> vectors have a protective effect on cochlear hair cells and can prolong their survival. Stereocilium bundles of inner ear hair cells play an important role in hair cell mechanotransduction. Shaker-1 mice have highly disorganized stereocilium bundles, likely because of the absence of MYO7A. While there was significant improvement in cochlear hair cell survival in shaker-1 mice treated with dual-AAV8(Y733F)-<italic toggle=""yes"">MYO7A</italic> vectors, we did not see improvements in stereocilium organization in the treated shaker-1 cochlea. The shaker-1 mice treated with dual-AAV8(Y733F)-<italic toggle=""yes"">MYO7A</italic> vectors had disorganized stereocilium bundles comparable with the stereocilia bundles seen in the untreated shaker-1 mice. These persistent structural deficits in stereocilium bundles correlate with the lack of hearing rescue seen in the treated shaker-1 mice. However, it is important to note that the cochlear hair cells in this mouse model undergo degeneration as early as embryonic day 17.5 (E17.5), and it may be necessary to deliver gene therapy <italic toggle=""yes"">in utero</italic> to rescue auditory function in these animals.<xref rid=""bib27"" ref-type=""bibr""><sup>27</sup></xref> We also observed a 10- to 30-dB ABR threshold elevation in wild-type and heterozygous littermates that were treated with dual-AAV8(Y733F)-<italic toggle=""yes"">MYO7A</italic> vectors, while wild-type and heterozygous littermates that were treated with virus vehicle did not show significant ABR threshold elevation compared with untreated wild-type and heterozygous animals. In addition, similar ABR threshold elevation was observed in wild-type and heterozygous littermates that were treated with 5′ vector alone or with AAV8(Y733F)-GFP. This suggests that there may be some toxicity associated with the dual-AAV8(Y733F)-<italic toggle=""yes"">MYO7A</italic> vectors in the cochlea. Interestingly, these were the same hybrid dual-AAV(Y733F) vectors used by Dyka et al.<xref rid=""bib13"" ref-type=""bibr""><sup>13</sup></xref> These vectors, used at similar doses as those employed in the current study, led to partial retinal degeneration following subretinal injection. Both results may be attributed to the deleterious effects of truncated protein arising from the 5′ vector or to the AAV8(Y733F) vector itself. Notably, these vectors have since been optimized to prevent production of this truncated protein. Future studies will evaluate their performance in the inner ear. The vestibular system is integral for maintaining balance and positioning. In contrast to the cochlea, the vestibular hair cells in shaker-1 mice do not undergo degeneration. Their structural maintenance relative to cochlear hair cells likely explains why the vestibular system was more amenable to the beneficial effects of inner ear gene therapy in this mouse model. Shaker-1 mice treated with the dual-AAV8(Y733F)-<italic toggle=""yes"">MYO7A</italic> vectors show high virus transduction (70%–80%) of vestibular hair cells throughout the utricle. In addition, we observed significant improvement in the organization and cohesion of the vestibular stereocilium bundles in the shaker-1 mice treated with the dual-AAV8(Y733F)-<italic toggle=""yes"">MYO7A</italic> vectors compared with that seen in the untreated shaker-1 mice. We examined circling behavior as a measure of vestibular function in shaker-1 mice treated with the dual-AAV8(Y733F)-<italic toggle=""yes"">MYO7A</italic> vectors. We observed that treated shaker-1 mice had a significant reduction in circling behavior compared with untreated shaker-1 mice. Several shaker-1 mice treated with dual-AAV8(Y733F)-<italic toggle=""yes"">MYO7A</italic> vectors had a significantly reduced amount of circling behavior comparable with that seen in the wild-type and heterozygous animals. The abnormally high level of circling behavior in shaker-1 mice was not improved with injection of the 5′ vector alone, indicating that the 5′ and 3′ AAV8(Y733F) vectors are necessary for a reduction of circling behavior in shaker-1 mice. Because circling behavior is an indirect measurement of vestibular function, we assessed VsEPs as a direct test of vestibular function. We found that dual-AAV8(Y733F)-<italic toggle=""yes"">MYO7A</italic> vectors improved VsEP thresholds in shaker-1 mice. In contrast, the untreated shaker-1 mice did not have measurable VsEP waveforms, even at the highest stimulus level. However, many of the treated shaker-1 mice had measurable VsEP waveforms. In fact, in one treated shaker-1 mouse, the VsEP thresholds were similar to those in the wild type. No VsEP responses were observed in the shaker-1 mice that received 5′ vector alone. In addition, the wild-type and heterozygous littermates that were treated with dual-AAV8(Y733F)-<italic toggle=""yes"">MYO7A</italic> vectors did not show any increase in circling or elevation of VsEP thresholds, in contrast to the 10- to 30-dB ABR threshold elevation observed in these animals. This suggests that the vestibular system in the shaker-1 mice may be more resistant to the potential toxicity of these dual vectors. Our study showed that delivery of <italic toggle=""yes"">MYO7A</italic> cDNA via the dual-AAV8(Y733F) vectors improved cochlear hair cell survival and vestibular function in shaker-1 mice. In a study by Wafa et al.,<xref rid=""bib32"" ref-type=""bibr""><sup>32</sup></xref> a cohort of 90 USH patients who had a molecular genetic diagnosis underwent a battery of vestibular tests to characterize their vestibular dysfunction. They found that all patients with type 1 USH had measurable vestibular abnormality in at least one of the vestibular tests that were performed. In addition, results from sensory organization test showed that many of the type 1 USH patients were at risk for falling,<xref rid=""bib32"" ref-type=""bibr""><sup>32</sup></xref> which is the leading cause of injury-related death in US adults older than 65 years of age.<xref rid=""bib33"" ref-type=""bibr""><sup>33</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid=""bib34"" ref-type=""bibr""><sup>34</sup></xref> Furthermore, it has been shown that vestibular hair cells are still present in a human temporal bone specimen from an elderly patient with USH1B.<xref rid=""bib35"" ref-type=""bibr""><sup>35</sup></xref> This demonstrates that the mature vestibular system in USH1B patients may still be viable and amenable to the therapeutic effects of inner ear gene therapy.

It is our hope that the results from this study will serve as a foundation for future clinical translation of gene replacement therapy to help patients with USH1B. ",N/A,21 8 2023

"<italic toggle=""yes"">USH2A</italic> variants causing retinitis pigmentosa or Usher syndrome provoke differential retinal phenotypes in disease-specific organoids","There is an emblematic clinical and genetic heterogeneity associated with inherited retinal diseases (IRDs). The most common form is retinitis pigmentosa (RP), a rod-cone dystrophy caused by pathogenic variants in over 80 different genes. Further complexifying diagnosis, different variants in individual RP genes can also alter the clinical phenotype. <italic toggle=""yes"">USH2A</italic> is the most prevalent gene for autosomal-recessive RP and one of the most challenging because of its large size and, hence, large number of variants.

The lack of a clear genotype-phenotype correlation or prognostic models renders diagnosis highly challenging. We report here a long-awaited differential non-syndromic RP and USH phenotype in three human disease-specific models: fibroblasts, induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs), and mature iPSC-derived retinal organoids. Moreover, we identified distinct retinal phenotypes in organoids from multiple RP and USH individuals, which were validated by isogenic-corrected controls. Non-syndromic RP organoids showed compromised photoreceptor differentiation, whereas USH organoids showed a striking and unexpected cone phenotype. Furthermore, complementary clinical investigations identified macular atrophy in a high proportion of USH compared with RP individuals, further validating our observations that <italic toggle=""yes"">USH2A</italic> variants differentially affect cones.

We hence extended our efforts to further decipher the genotype-phenotype relationship of <italic toggle=""yes"">USH2A</italic> mutations by studying fibroblasts, iPSCs, and iPSC-derived retinal organoids of affected individuals with different <italic toggle=""yes"">USH2A</italic> variants. Here, we report differential non-syndromic RP and USH phenotypes in all models investigated. Moreover, we report a mature human retinal organoid model system of <italic toggle=""yes"">USH2A</italic>-specific mutations, allowing us to detect usherin expression at the CC of human photoreceptors. Furthermore, phenotypic reversion and restored usherin expression in retinal organoids was demonstrated using CRISPR-Cas-mediated gene-corrected isogenic controls. Last, by performing additional tailored clinical investigations, the unexpected differential retinal phenotype of the human organoids was confirmed at the clinical level in RP and USH individuals. Together, these data provide long-awaited direct evidence of a genotype-phenotype correlation associated with <italic toggle=""yes"">USH2A</italic> mutations.   We report here a human 3D retinal organoid-based, disease-modeling study of non-syndromic RP and USH because of variants in <italic toggle=""yes"">USH2A</italic>. Using three different human cellular models, we describe a clear genotype-phenotype correlation associated with <italic toggle=""yes"">USH2A</italic> mutations in each model, which is disease dependent. Furthermore, we identify a differential retinal disease phenotype in non-syndromic RP and USH models, which includes a previously unsuspected cone defect seen predominantly in USH lines that is consistent with the clinical data. These data provide invaluable information for elaborating a diagnosis, clarifying the pathogenicity of novel variants, and testing therapeutic efficiency. Phenotypic variability in individuals presenting pathogenic variants in genes associated with USH has been extensively documented.<xref rid=""bib17"" ref-type=""bibr""><sup>17</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid=""bib48"" ref-type=""bibr""><sup>48</sup></xref> In the case of <italic toggle=""yes"">USH2A</italic>, a genotype-phenotype correlation was suggested by the concept of retinal disease-specific <italic toggle=""yes"">USH2A</italic> alleles.<xref rid=""bib15"" ref-type=""bibr""><sup>15</sup></xref> Individuals presenting with at least one such allele, notably c.2276G>T, had preserved hearing, and thus these variants were proposed to be disease causing exclusively for non-syndromic RP. In the current study, we go one step further and demonstrate that the differential phenotype observed in non-syndromic RP or USH individuals with <italic toggle=""yes"">USH2A</italic> variants goes beyond differential hearing impairment because differences in ciliogenesis, mRNA expression, and molecular and structural retinal phenotypes were also observed, depending on the disease. The first genotype-phenotype correlation from this study is the disease-dependent, and perhaps mutation-dependent, elongated primary cilium in affected fibroblasts. A similar observation has been reported in fibroblasts of two individuals with either early onset IRD or congenital blindness homozygous for a nonsense mutation in <italic toggle=""yes"">CEP290</italic>.<xref rid=""bib49"" ref-type=""bibr""><sup>49</sup></xref> The cilia of the individual with congenital blindness were significantly longer than those of the early-onset IRD counterpart, which were also longer than the control. These results are reminiscent of our findings; thus, we could speculate that there is a direct correlation between cilium length and disease severity associated to <italic toggle=""yes"">USH2A</italic> mutations. If confirmed in a larger number of control and affected samples, then this would suggest that the study of ciliogenesis in skin fibroblasts could be used as a rapid screening test by laboratories to determine the pathogenicity of newly identified <italic toggle=""yes"">USH2A</italic> variants. The second clear genotype-phenotype correlation described in the current study is the confirmation of our previous observations concerning differential <italic toggle=""yes"">USH2A</italic> expression profiles in affected iPSCs.<xref rid=""bib37"" ref-type=""bibr""><sup>37</sup></xref> Globally, we confirm that missense RP-associated variants result in <italic toggle=""yes"">USH2A</italic> mRNA levels similar to control, whereas USH-associated variants that lead to premature termination codons result in significantly increased <italic toggle=""yes"">USH2A</italic> mRNA levels, even when they are localized outside of exon 13. These results further support our previous hypothesis that mutant <italic toggle=""yes"">USH2A</italic> mRNA transcripts housing premature stop codons are not degraded by the nonsense-mediated mRNA decay pathway in iPSCs. Importantly, these observations could be exploited to differentiate between non-syndromic RP- or USH-causing <italic toggle=""yes"">USH2A</italic> variants. It should be noted that this phenomenon is only observed in iPSCs and that the <italic toggle=""yes"">USH2A</italic> mRNA levels in retinal organoids do not follow this same pattern, suggesting activation of nonsense-mediated decay. Moreover, by using additional mutant iPSC lines, we show that not only the USH but also the RP lines carrying the c.2299delG allele have the highest <italic toggle=""yes"">USH2A</italic> expression levels of the USH and RP groups, respectively. Furthermore, within the non-syndromic RP group, we show that the iPSC lines carrying biallelic exon 13 variants have higher <italic toggle=""yes"">USH2A</italic> levels than the line carrying a mono-allelic exon 13 variant. This profile was mirrored in terms of ciliary length in disease-specific fibroblasts, making it tempting to speculate that exon 13 variants may exacerbate the corresponding phenotypes. This is consistent with a previous study showing that exon 13 missense mutations and deletions disrupt disulfide bonds and may affect local protein folding, thus having consequences for protein function.<xref rid=""bib50"" ref-type=""bibr""><sup>50</sup></xref> The third and most compelling genotype-phenotype correlation of this study is the differential retinal phenotype identified in the iPSC-derived organoids from USH and non-syndromic RP individuals.

Even though the differentiation protocol used<xref rid=""bib44"" ref-type=""bibr""><sup>44</sup></xref> was slightly different than that in our study, the reported RP organoids presented a disorganized presumptive ONL, consistent with our observations. However, the lack of isogenic controls prevented validation of the phenotype, and no conclusions could be drawn concerning <italic toggle=""yes"">USH2A</italic>-associated disease phenotype in more mature photoreceptors. Our results suggest differential retinal phenotypes in organoids on day 225 that are not individual or mutation dependent but disease dependent and that, importantly, were validated by parallel differentiation of isogenic control lines. The RP organoids present a more disorganized phenotype in terms of IS/OS elongation and formation compared with USH or control organoids. In addition, aberrant formation of rod photoreceptors in RP organoids is much more pronounced than in USH organoids. By contrast, the cone phenotype is far more striking for USH organoids than RP organoids. This may be due to the differences in the structure of photoreceptor cilia in cones and rods. In cones, the axoneme of the CC extends the length of the OS, suggesting an important role in disc morphogenesis and turnover, whereas in rods, the microtubules of the axoneme end at a lower level of the OS.<xref rid=""bib53"" ref-type=""bibr""><sup>53</sup></xref> Furthermore, human cones also possess more calyceal processes than rod photoreceptor cells.<xref rid=""bib20"" ref-type=""bibr""><sup>20</sup></xref> As cellular protrusions of the IS, these calyceal processes contain USH proteins and presumably serve to stabilize the OS against mechanical forces.<xref rid=""bib54"" ref-type=""bibr""><sup>54</sup></xref> Therefore, we can speculate that absence of usherin, such as in the case of USH organoids, could have a more dramatic effect on cone morphology and function. Several reports have underlined a difference in the severity of the RP phenotype between USH and non-syndromic RP individuals, with USH individuals being more severely affected.<xref rid=""bib12"" ref-type=""bibr""><sup>12</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid=""bib55"" ref-type=""bibr""><sup>55</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid=""bib56"" ref-type=""bibr""><sup>56</sup></xref> Similarly, previous observations in <italic toggle=""yes"">ush2a</italic>-mutant zebrafish lines suggested that progression and onset of retinal degeneration depend on the introduced mutation.<xref rid=""bib21"" ref-type=""bibr""><sup>21</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid=""bib22"" ref-type=""bibr""><sup>22</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid=""bib23"" ref-type=""bibr""><sup>23</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid=""bib24"" ref-type=""bibr""><sup>24</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid=""bib25"" ref-type=""bibr""><sup>25</sup></xref> However, there have not been any studies focusing specifically on cone differences. Our clinical data using short-wave fundus autofluorescence imaging demonstrate that there is perifoveal atrophy more frequently associated with USH individuals and at a younger age. This atrophy exacerbates the visual handicap by perifovealar damage and then impacts visual acuity by its progression toward the fovea. Similarly, Sengillo et al.<xref rid=""bib57"" ref-type=""bibr""><sup>57</sup></xref> previously noted that perifoveal atrophy was more frequently observed in USH as opposed to non-syndromic RP cases associated with <italic toggle=""yes"">USH2A</italic> variants. These authors further suggested that genotype-phenotype correlation of subjective hearing loss in <italic toggle=""yes"">USH2A</italic> individuals may be predictive of worse cone function and, thus, visual phenotype. Our retinal organoid data definitively confirm the cone involvement in USH individuals and furthermore suggest that this difference is not simply due to more rapid progression of the rod-cone phenotype but, rather, due to an autonomous cone defect. The clinical differences observed between RP and USH individuals could indeed reflect the cone dissimilarities observed in the organoid models. The occurrence of perifoveal atrophy concerns a zone where cones and rods are present with an estimated ratio of 1:18.<xref rid=""bib58"" ref-type=""bibr""><sup>58</sup></xref> This zone is specifically affected by macular atrophy as a final stage of cone dystrophy and other genetic or multifactorial macular diseases. In IRDs specifically, an alteration in cone density in the area of the hyperautofluorescent perifoveal ring was demonstrated by adaptive optics on the cone mosaic of RP individuals<xref rid=""bib59"" ref-type=""bibr""><sup>59</sup></xref> and preferential perifoveal cone anomalies in early Stargardt’s disease.<xref rid=""bib60"" ref-type=""bibr""><sup>60</sup></xref> We have reported previously that our retinal organoid model presents a rod-cone ratio of 1:3, which is similar to that described for the parafoveal region of the human retina.<xref rid=""bib28"" ref-type=""bibr""><sup>28</sup></xref> The two USH individuals we modeled using retinal organoids showed the most advanced stages of perifoveal atrophy, reaching well into the fovea. This may be why we were able to detect a striking cone phenotype in the retinal organoids of these patients. It would now be interesting to generate iPSC-derived retinal organoids of younger USH individuals with less advanced or no signs of perifoveal atrophy to see whether a cone phenotype is still detectable. Interestingly, and providing further support for our data, two animal models of <italic toggle=""yes"">USH2A</italic> exon 13 mutations were reported during preparation of this manuscript. The first was a rabbit model carrying a frameshift mutation in the exon equivalent to human exon 13.<xref rid=""bib61"" ref-type=""bibr""><sup>61</sup></xref> Similar to our data, this model showed decreased <italic toggle=""yes"">USH2A</italic> expression and absence of usherin in the retina. Furthermore, from 7 months of age, <italic toggle=""yes"">USH2A</italic> knockout rabbits showed progressive deterioration of rod and, notably, cone function by electroretinography (ERG) recordings, mimicking the reduced cone function in humans. Interestingly, these USH-related reduced cone ERGs are also consistent with observations in another large animal model for USH, the USH1C porcine model.<xref rid=""bib62"" ref-type=""bibr""><sup>62</sup></xref> The second was a humanized mouse model for the murine equivalent of the c.2299delG mutation.<xref rid=""bib63"" ref-type=""bibr""><sup>63</sup></xref> Consistent with our results, full-length usherin (as well as ADGRV1) was not detected at the base of the CC, although use of a FLAG tag suggested that the truncated protein accumulates in the IS. The knockin mice also showed decreased rod and cone ERG responses but only at late stages (>3 years of age). In contrast to our fibroblast and organoid data, this murine study suggested shortening of the CC of photoreceptors in the mutant mice. This discrepancy may stem from the well-described differences in the structural architecture between the human and murine ciliary region,<xref rid=""bib20"" ref-type=""bibr""><sup>20</sup></xref> further arguing for the pertinence of a human model. Regardless, an interesting observation in this animal model was that the CC changes occurred early, preceding photoreceptor degeneration and visual loss, which suggested a developmental defect of the CC structure. These data further validate the differences we observed on the human retinal organoids, which were studied on day 225 (32 weeks) and could thus be considered equivalent to the fetal period.<xref rid=""bib64"" ref-type=""bibr""><sup>64</sup></xref> There are some additional noteworthy aspects of this retinal organoid study. First, the phenotype of the organoids from USH2A-RP-3 homozygous for the c.2276G>T variant allows us to confirm the pathogenicity of this variant, which was recently determined in a zebrafish model.<xref rid=""bib24"" ref-type=""bibr""><sup>24</sup></xref> Second, we determined in a human retinal model that usherin is present at the tip of the ciliary rootlet. Third, we show that the mislocalization/absence of usherin in RP/USH organoids, respectively, also results in mislocalization/absence of its partner ADGRV1, thus suggesting impaired formation and function of the USH interactome in human cells. The ciliogenesis defects in the affected fibroblasts therefore raise the question of whether usherin may have roles in other ciliated tissues in addition to the retina or the ear.<xref rid=""bib65"" ref-type=""bibr""><sup>65</sup></xref> This is in line with identification of at least two protein isoforms for <italic toggle=""yes"">USH2A</italic>:<xref rid=""bib11"" ref-type=""bibr""><sup>11</sup></xref> a long transmembrane isoform that is predominant in the retina<xref rid=""bib19"" ref-type=""bibr""><sup>19</sup></xref> and a short secreted N-terminal isoform that is more widely expressed.<xref rid=""bib11"" ref-type=""bibr""><sup>11</sup></xref> Further studies concerning actin cytoskeleton assembly are needed to better understand the <italic toggle=""yes"">USH2A</italic>-related ciliogenesis defects. Last, the effect of CRISPR-Cas-mediated correction on the phenotype of the affected organoids also yielded some interesting observations. Correction of the c.2276G>T variant in the RP organoids markedly improved OS formation and/or elongation but did not fully restore a control phenotype, particularly for rods. This is likely due to the presence of the c.2299delG variant on the non-corrected allele in the isogenic organoids, suggesting that carriers of loss-of-function <italic toggle=""yes"">USH2A</italic> variants may harbor subclinical retinal alterations. Interestingly, the cone phenotype was restored to control after gene correction in the RP and USH organoids, further validating the unexpected phenotype as being directly due to <italic toggle=""yes"">USH2A</italic> variants. Similarly, usherin and ADGRV1 localization were correctly restored in RP and USH organoids. Taken together, these data additionally provide a proof of concept that, in photoreceptors, this <italic toggle=""yes"">USH2A</italic> genome-editing strategy is a viable therapeutic option. In conclusion, collectively, our data provide long-awaited evidence of a genotype-phenotype correlation associated with <italic toggle=""yes"">USH2A</italic> variants in a sophisticated human retinal model. Furthermore, they provide robust readouts in multiple cellular models for testing the pathogenicity of variants of uncertain significance as well as the efficacy of therapeutic approaches.",N/A,07 8 2023
Usher Syndrome on the Island of Ireland: A Genotype-Phenotype Review,,"Patients recruited to Target 5000<xref rid=""bib36"" ref-type=""bibr""><sup>36</sup></xref><sup>–</sup><xref rid=""bib40"" ref-type=""bibr""><sup>40</sup></xref> with a clinical USH diagnosis were included in this retrospective study. All patients signed informed consent to participate with the assistance of sign language translators where required. This study was approved by the institutional review boards of the participating sites (Royal Victoria Eye & Ear Hospital, Dublin, Ireland; Mater Misericordiae University Hospital, Dublin, Ireland; Belfast Health & Social Care Trust, Belfast, Northern Ireland; Trinity College Dublin, Dublin, Ireland) and abides by the Declaration of Helsinki. Ophthalmic phenotyping included best corrected logarithm of the minimum angle of resolution (LogMAR) visual acuity (VA), refraction, applanation tonometry and dilated slit lamp biomicroscopy. Refraction was assessed for all phakic eyes (preoperative refraction used when available) and a comparison made between clinical USH subtypes and genotypes. Multimodal imaging including ultra-widefield fundus photography and autofluorescence (“California,” Optos Plc, Dunfermline, UK) and spectral domain optical coherence tomography (OCT; Cirrus 5000; Carl Zeiss Meditec, Jena, Germany). Visual field (VF) to the IV4e target (VF; Goldmann Visual Field, Haag-Streit, Switzerland; or Humphrey Visual Field Analyser; Carl Zeiss MediTec) and International Society for the Clinical Electrophysiology of Vision standard electrophysiology were documented as available. Determination of USH subtype was suggested by the clinical phenotype (<xref rid=""tbl1"" ref-type=""table"">Table 1</xref>) in accordance with the Usher Syndrome Consortium<xref rid=""bib6"" ref-type=""bibr""><sup>6</sup></xref> and confirmed via genetic sequencing. Audiology was used to help categorize USH subtype; however, quantitative auditory and vestibular data were limited due to the ophthalmic focus of this study.

We describe the largest reported Irish USH cohort (145 patients) with 24.1% USH1, 73.8% USH2, 1.4% USH3, and 0.7% USH4. Biallelic genetic resolution rate was 82.1%, with a single USH-implicated allele found in 4.1%. VA ≤0.3 LogMAR was maintained in ≥1 eye in 63.1% at a mean age of 43.31 years. <italic toggle=""yes"">ADGRV1</italic> patients had the greatest VF constriction. <italic toggle=""yes"">USH2A</italic> patients were significantly more myopic than other genotypes highlighting both a point of intervention and phenotypic guidance for genetic testing. CML (26.9%) and cataract (77.4%) were prevalent; however, pseudophakic individuals had worse VA, likely due to the more advanced retinopathy of older subjects. Although no definitive cure for USH retinopathy is yet available, modifiable auditory and visual treatments and practical/social supports can be implemented now. Accurate clinical phenotyping and genetic characterization enables genetic counseling and determines prognosis and suitability for upcoming therapeutic clinical trials.

Awareness of Usher Syndrome and the Need for Multidisciplinary Care: A Cross-Occupational Survey of Allied Health Clinicians,,"Ethical approval was received from the University of Melbourne (ID 2021–22187). Purposive sampling was used, with participants grouped by allied health discipline. The only inclusion criteria were that participants were audiologists, optometrists or orthoptists working in a clinical role in an Australian University teaching clinic. These clinics were approached with the view that clinicians employed in a university setting would be more likely to participate in research; the intention was to minimize, as far as possible, the self-selection bias of clinicians being more likely to participate if they had an interest in Usher syndrome, and therefore knew more about it. There was no pre-determined sample size; the aim was to recruit as close as possible to 100% of clinicians in each clinic. As participation was anonymous, no incentive was provided to participants nor was feedback given. Participants who wished to receive information about study outcomes provided an email address. Data were collected using an online mixed-methods survey accessed via the Qualtrics platform (Qualtrics, Provo, UT). This was hosted by the University of Melbourne (license holder), with authors affiliated with the University of Melbourne (KG and LA) managing data collection. The survey was constructed by authors KG (audiologist with cochlear implant expertise), LA (optometrist with inherited retinal disease expertise), ES (community advocacy and support group director, mother with lived experience of a child with Usher syndrome Type I), LJ (community advocacy and support group staff member), and FOH (orthoptist with inherited retinal disease and hearing loss expertise) to examine basic awareness of Usher syndrome. To maximize the response rate within each clinic, a balance was achieved between the breadth and depth of data collected and the expected survey response time. The initial survey questions were drafted by the authors based on previous literature, clinician experience, and lived family/carer experience. External, independent clinicians (two audiologists, two speech pathologists, one optometrist and one orthoptist) provided feedback on the draft survey; they also indicated their answers to the healthcare clinicians who had a key or secondary role in supporting people with Usher syndrome. In response to the feedback, some questions were removed or added, and modifications were made to the wording and the response format of other questions. The survey was then trialed via the survey link to the Qualtrics platform by three optometrists, two orthoptists, two speech pathologists and two audiologists. These clinicians did not work in university teaching clinics, and their data were not included in the final data set. The final survey included nine closed-set demographic questions, including age, gender, years of clinical experience, patient groups treated, and type of clinical specialty. There were also five open-set and four closed-set questions related to the cause of Usher syndrome, the senses impacted, common sequelae, and the involvement of healthcare clinicians in management. The full list of survey questions is provided as <underline><ext-link http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink href=""https://www.dovepress.com/get_supplementary_file.php?f=411306.docx"" ext-link-type=""uri"">Supplemental Digital Content</ext-link></underline>. Survey branching ensured that participants were only presented with questions relevant to the level of knowledge demonstrated in their earlier responses, so the expected time to complete the survey was two minutes for participants with minimal knowledge and five to eight minutes for participants who completed all questions. The managers of all Australian university teaching clinics in optometry, orthoptics and audiology (n = 16) were emailed an invitation for their clinic to participate, and twelve managers agreed. To ensure the anonymity of respondents, each clinic’s manager circulated the advertising material containing the survey link to their own clinical staff and re-circulated the material one week later as a reminder to participate. The link accessed the plain-language participant information form. Ticking the consent box at the end of this form enabled access to the survey questions. Data were collected from September 2021 to February 2022. Survey data was downloaded from the Qualtrics platform and imported into SPSS software for statistical analysis. Eight incomplete responses were removed during data cleaning prior to analysis. Descriptive statistics (percentage answering correctly) were calculated for each item as a function of the clinical discipline. Fisher’s exact test of association was used to make comparisons between the “eye” professions (optometry and orthoptics) and the “ear” profession (audiology). We collapsed the eye professions into one group, given similar percentages of respondents and results in these related professions and the small sample size of orthoptists. Content analysis was applied to the open-set data related to the key aspects of hearing-related care (for audiologists) and vision-related care (for optometrists and orthoptists) to identify the most commonly reported management strategies. Content categories were generated through discussion between authors FO, ES and LA. The percentage of respondents who provided a response within each category was then calculated as a function of the clinical discipline independently by authors LA and FO and checked for discrepancies by author ES. Any disagreements in categorisations were discussed by this group of authors, and a consensus reached. <xref rid=""t0001"" ref-type=""table"">Table 1</xref> presents response rates and demographic information for each discipline.

This survey of audiologists, representing a hearing-related discipline, and optometrists and orthoptists, representing a vision-related discipline, showed high levels of awareness of Usher syndrome and its genetic cause. Additionally, there were moderately high levels of awareness across respondents and discipline groups of the key characteristics of the vision and hearing loss experienced by people with Usher syndrome. Vestibular characteristics of the condition were the least well identified, with audiologists less likely than eyecare practitioners to identify key vestibular characteristics. All surveyed disciplines were particularly poor at identifying the outcomes of postural instability and gross motor delay. Educational activities for audiologists, optometrists and orthoptists should focus on the variability and details of vision and hearing loss, along with the possibility of vestibular dysfunction, experienced by individuals with Usher syndrome. These educational activities will be relevant to all three disciplines. In terms of the role of different disciplines in Usher syndrome care, only audiologists were correctly identified as having a key role by more than 90% of all respondents. Educational activities should emphasize the critical importance of referring to clinicians in key disciplines, and of the need for the engagement of a multidisciplinary team in the care of individuals with Usher syndrome. Priority should be given to educating audiologists, optometrists and orthoptists regarding the role of speech pathologists in the development of clear speech, expressive and receptive language, and pragmatic communication skills. Recent initiatives, such as university cross-disciplinary allied health education,<xref rid=""cit0018"" ref-type=""bibr"">18</xref> will likely improve understanding of the role of different disciplines in healthcare in general. Nevertheless, specialized educational programs will likely be required to maximize multidisciplinary co-operation in caring for people with Usher syndrome. Such co-operation is particularly important in rare and complex conditions, as a lack of coordinated care and consistent information across both medical and non-medical domains can lead to poorer outcomes.<xref rid=""cit0019"" ref-type=""bibr"">19</xref> The contribution of various medical practitioners (ophthalmologist, pediatrician, GP, and ENT) needs to be made clearer to audiologists, optometrists, and orthoptists, given that, for each type of medical practitioner, their key role was not well recognized by the respondents. In reality, each of these medical practitioners has an important contribution to make; this includes the GP who, in Australia, has a critical liaison role in managing treatment across multidisciplinary teams. Of note, this study found that only around half of audiologists identified geneticists and genetic counsellors as having a key role in Usher syndrome management. Audiologists will benefit from targeted education regarding the role of genetic counsellors in helping people with Usher syndrome to navigate challenges such as family planning, and the important role of geneticists in diagnosing Usher syndrome variants, given the variation in symptom pattern and severity across Types I, II, and III described above. As audiologists are involved in providing care to very young children with hearing loss and more than half of all children with bilateral sensorineural hearing loss have a genetic cause,<xref rid=""cit0019"" ref-type=""bibr"">19</xref> audiologists are uniquely positioned to provide families with information and referral for genetic testing. Information and referral are particularly important for families with concerns about visual symptoms and/or poor coordination and clumsiness, as this combination of symptoms may be due to Usher syndrome. As 95% of children with hearing loss are born to parents with normal hearing,<xref rid=""cit0020"" ref-type=""bibr"">20</xref> an audiologist is often the first point-of-contact with relevant sections of the healthcare system, and the main source of early information. As such, it is critical that audiologists have the knowledge required to provide accurate and supportive information to families and to refer them to appropriate services.<xref rid=""cit0018"" ref-type=""bibr"">18</xref> Regarding respondents’ knowledge of key aspects of care for individuals with Usher syndrome within their own discipline, the results indicate relatively low levels of awareness. These findings could be due to the clinician not considering a particular aspect of care, such as genetic testing, as being relevant to their own discipline. Although such testing would not be conducted by the respondents in this study, referral for genetic testing should be part of the care they provide. The low level of awareness is perhaps not surprising, given that 73 of the 74 respondents had no particular experience caring for people with Usher syndrome. There are no specialized Usher syndrome clinics in Australia, so families will be attending general clinics, especially prior to and around the time of diagnosis. This is at a time when families are most vulnerable and can be easily traumatized by poorly informed comments or advice from treating clinicians. The important point here is not whether respondents have all of the required knowledge to provide ongoing quality care for people with Usher syndrome, but rather that they are sufficiently aware to take appropriate initial steps in response to the needs of an individual and their family. Potential limitations of this study included the low response rate for invited optometrists (42%) and the small number of orthoptists (n = 7). Only one of the three university-affiliated orthoptic clinics in Australia agreed to participate in the study, and the small number of participants may have resulted in skewed data. The low response rate of optometrists is, if anything, likely to have over-estimated levels of awareness amongst this group. This is because individuals are more likely to respond to a survey if the topic is salient, ie, noticeable or important to them.<xref rid=""cit0021"" ref-type=""bibr"">21</xref> The topic of Usher syndrome is most likely to be salient for individuals who already know something about the syndrome and less salient for those with no knowledge. The targeted recruitment of clinicians in university-affiliated clinics in an effort to maximize response rates is a limitation in terms of the generalizability of the results across the broader clinician population. Again, if anything, data collected from this highly educated population, which is exposed to the conduct and outcomes of research in their workplace, are likely to have overestimated the level of awareness of Usher syndrome. This survey of audiologists, optometrists and orthoptists in Australian university-affiliated clinics found high levels of awareness of the genetic cause of Usher syndrome, and of the presence and most key characteristics of hearing loss and vision loss. The allied-health clinician respondents were less aware of the possibility of vestibular dysfunction and its consequences. Awareness of the key role of various healthcare disciplines in multi-disciplinary care varied, with no respondent group demonstrating high levels of awareness across different professionals. Awareness was particularly low for all respondent groups regarding the role of speech pathologists and low for audiologists regarding the role of geneticists and genetic counsellors. Levels of awareness of important aspects of care within the respondent’s own discipline were generally low, although this may have been influenced by the open-set nature of the questions. Evidence suggests that early and appropriate referral to the key professionals involved in the care of patients with Usher syndrome is imperative in ensuring that they, and their families, receive a timely diagnosis, appropriate psychosocial support and specific management for all three sensory aspects. Not only does this optimize the potential benefits of early intervention but also improves the psychosocial impact of the diagnosis. Whilst there is no cure for Usher syndrome, the importance of proactive referral from the start and enabling patients and families to ask questions and be provided with accurate information can improve long-term outcomes. The findings from this study suggest that audiology, optometry and orthoptic professionals could benefit from education regarding the key aspects of Usher syndrome care. Future research should examine optimal tools and methods for delivering this education.",N/A,13 7 2023
Usher syndrome proteins ADGRV1 (USH2C) and CIB2 (USH1J) interact and share a common interactome containing TRiC/CCT-BBS chaperonins,"The human Usher syndrome (USH) is the most common form of a sensory hereditary ciliopathy characterized by progressive vision and hearing loss. Mutations in the genes <italic toggle=""yes"">ADGRV1</italic> and <italic toggle=""yes"">CIB2</italic> have been associated with two distinct sub-types of USH, namely, USH2C and USH1J. The proteins encoded by the two genes belong to very distinct protein families: the adhesion G protein-coupled receptor ADGRV1 also known as the very large G protein-coupled receptor 1 (VLGR1) and the Ca<sup>2+</sup>- and integrin-binding protein 2 (CIB2), respectively. In the absence of tangible knowledge of the molecular function of ADGRV1 and CIB2, pathomechanisms underlying USH2C and USH1J are still unknown. Here, we aimed to enlighten the cellular functions of CIB2 and ADGRV1 by the identification of interacting proteins, a knowledge that is commonly indicative of cellular functions. Applying affinity proteomics by tandem affinity purification in combination with mass spectrometry, we identified novel potential binding partners of the CIB2 protein and compared these with the data set we previously obtained for ADGRV1. Surprisingly, the interactomes of both USH proteins showed a high degree of overlap indicating their integration in common networks, cellular pathways and functional modules which we confirmed by GO term analysis. Validation of protein interactions revealed that ADGRV1 and CIB2 mutually interact. In addition, we showed that the USH proteins also interact with the TRiC/CCT chaperonin complex and the Bardet Biedl syndrome (BBS) chaperonin-like proteins. Immunohistochemistry on retinal sections demonstrated the co-localization of the interacting partners at the photoreceptor cilia, supporting the role of USH proteins ADGRV1 and CIB2 in primary cilia function. The interconnection of protein networks involved in the pathogenesis of both syndromic retinal dystrophies BBS and USH suggest shared pathomechanisms for both syndromes on the molecular level.","The human Usher syndrome (USH) is a clinically and genetically heterogeneous autosomal recessive disorder characterized by deafness and vestibular dysfunction combined with vision loss due to <italic toggle=""yes"">Retinitis pigmentosa</italic> (<xref rid=""B53"" ref-type=""bibr"">Reiners et al., 2006</xref>; <xref rid=""B14"" ref-type=""bibr"">Delmaghani and El-Amraoui, 2022</xref>). Three types of USH (USH1, USH2 and USH3) are distinguished, based on the age of onset, disease progression and the severity of the symptoms. To date, only one gene for USH3, <italic toggle=""yes"">CLRN1</italic>, three genes for USH2, <italic toggle=""yes"">USH2A</italic>, <italic toggle=""yes"">ADGRV1</italic> (USH2C), <italic toggle=""yes"">WHRN</italic> (USH2D), and six USH1 genes, <italic toggle=""yes"">MYO7A</italic> (USH1B), <italic toggle=""yes"">USH1C, CDH23</italic> (USH1D), <italic toggle=""yes"">PCDH15</italic> (USH1F), <italic toggle=""yes"">USH1G,</italic> and <italic toggle=""yes"">CIB2</italic> (USH1J) have been assigned to USH (<xref rid=""B19"" ref-type=""bibr"">Fuster-García et al., 2021</xref>). Recently, the association of mutations in CIB2 with USH and the assignment to USH1J (<xref rid=""B54"" ref-type=""bibr"">Riazuddin et al., 2012</xref>) has been debated (<xref rid=""B12"" ref-type=""bibr"">Dal Cortivo and Dell’orco, 2022</xref>; <xref rid=""B14"" ref-type=""bibr"">Delmaghani and El-Amraoui, 2022</xref>). Clinical analysis on patients with confirmed mutations in <italic toggle=""yes"">CIB2</italic>, a NGS meta-analysis of USH patients, and work on <italic toggle=""yes"">cib2</italic> mouse models have recently raised doubts that <italic toggle=""yes"">CIB2</italic> is a USH-causing gene, but rather a gene for non-syndromic deafness (DFNB48) (<xref rid=""B48"" ref-type=""bibr"">Michel et al., 2017</xref>; <xref rid=""B6"" ref-type=""bibr"">Booth et al., 2018</xref>; <xref rid=""B32"" ref-type=""bibr"">Jouret et al., 2019</xref>). However, a recent study found a distinct visual phenotype alongside deafness in a <italic toggle=""yes"">cib2</italic>-deficient mouse model, confirming the association of <italic toggle=""yes"">CIB2</italic> defects with syndromic inherited retinal dystrophies (IRD) such as USH (<xref rid=""B60"" ref-type=""bibr"">Sethna et al., 2021</xref>). The various USH genes encode very heterogeneous families and groups of proteins, such as scaffold proteins, transmembrane proteins, or motor proteins, but they share the common feature of being involved in common protein networks called the USH interactome (<xref rid=""B53"" ref-type=""bibr"">Reiners et al., 2006</xref>; <xref rid=""B42"" ref-type=""bibr"">Mathur and Yang, 2015</xref>). However, the cellular function of these USH proteins in photoreceptors and hair cells has not been fully elucidated, an understanding that would be necessary to mitigate the phenotypic burden of mutations in any of the USH genes by means of sound treatment. Here, we focus on <italic toggle=""yes"">ADGRV1</italic> (USH2C) and <italic toggle=""yes"">CIB2</italic> (USH1J) that codify the very large G protein-coupled receptor 1 (VLGR1) ADGRV1 and the Ca<sup>2+</sup>- and integrin-binding protein 2 (CIB2), respectively. CIB2 shares sequence identity with calmodulin and calcineurin B and contains three EF-hand domains, whereby only the last two domains can bind Ca<sup>2+</sup> (<xref rid=""F1"" ref-type=""fig"">Figure 1</xref>) (<xref rid=""B12"" ref-type=""bibr"">Dal Cortivo and Dell’orco, 2022</xref>). CIB2 is expressed in diverse tissues and cell types, such as the skeletal muscle, platelet cells, diverse nervous tissue as well as the sensory cells in the retina and the inner ear (<xref rid=""B54"" ref-type=""bibr"">Riazuddin et al., 2012</xref>; <xref rid=""B29"" ref-type=""bibr"">Jacoszek et al., 2017</xref>). CIB2 is involved in the regulation of Ca<sup>2+</sup>-homeostasis and interacts with integrins (<xref rid=""B26"" ref-type=""bibr"">Häger et al., 2008</xref>), important for hair cell differentiation and stereocilia development (<xref rid=""B17"" ref-type=""bibr"">Evans and Müller, 2000</xref>). In the eye, CIB2 is found in the neuronal retina and the retinal pigment epithelium where it participates in mTORC1 signaling and autophagy (<xref rid=""B60"" ref-type=""bibr"">Sethna et al., 2021</xref>). The ADGRV1 protein, also known as VLGR1, GPR98, MASS1, or FEB4 is a seven-transmembrane receptor that belongs to the adhesion GPCR (ADGR) family (<xref rid=""B46"" ref-type=""bibr"">McMillan and White, 2010</xref>; <xref rid=""B27"" ref-type=""bibr"">Hamann et al., 2015</xref>). The characteristic very long extracellular domain of ADGRV1 comprises 35 Ca<sup>2+</sup>-binding Calx-beta domains (Calxβ), a laminin G/pentraxin domain (LamG/PTX), six epitempin/epilepsy-associated repeats (EPTP/EAR) and a G protein-coupled receptor proteolytic site (GPS), which is embedded in the GPCR autoproteolysis-inducing (GAIN) domain and divides the molecule in a N-terminal fragment (NTF) and a C-terminal fragment (CTF) (<xref rid=""F1"" ref-type=""fig"">Figure 1A</xref>). The very C-terminal intracellular domain of ADGRV1 displays a terminal class I PDZ-binding motif (PBM). Like CIB2, ADGRV1 is expressed in various tissues, most abundantly in the retina, the inner ear and the brain (<xref rid=""B53"" ref-type=""bibr"">Reiners et al., 2006</xref>; <xref rid=""B46"" ref-type=""bibr"">McMillan and White, 2010</xref>). ADGRV1 is essential for the formation of ankle-links during the development of hair cells (<xref rid=""B45"" ref-type=""bibr"">McGee et al., 2006</xref>; <xref rid=""B47"" ref-type=""bibr"">Michalski et al., 2007</xref>; <xref rid=""B73"" ref-type=""bibr"">Yagi et al., 2007</xref>). Defects in <italic toggle=""yes"">Adgrv1</italic> result in disorganized hair bundles, which manifest in hearing impairment. In photoreceptor cells, ADGRV1 builds fibrous links between the apical inner segment and the connecting cilium, which resemble the ankle links in hair cells and are lost in <italic toggle=""yes"">Adgrv1</italic> mutant mice (<xref rid=""B41"" ref-type=""bibr"">Maerker et al., 2008</xref>). In the past years, it became evident that USH proteins are part of larger protein networks that are present in cilia, antenna-like structures that emerge from the cell surface (<xref rid=""B69"" ref-type=""bibr"">Van Wijk et al., 2009</xref>; <xref rid=""B72"" ref-type=""bibr"">Wright et al., 2012</xref>; <xref rid=""B43"" ref-type=""bibr"">May-Simera et al., 2017</xref>; <xref rid=""B64"" ref-type=""bibr"">Sorusch et al., 2017</xref>). Diseases affecting ciliary function - so-called ciliopathies - include besides USH, for example, also the Bardet Biedl syndrome (BBS) and numerous non-syndromic IRDs such as Leber congenital amaurosis (LCA) (<xref rid=""B2"" ref-type=""bibr"">Bettencourt-Dias et al., 2011</xref>; <xref rid=""B8"" ref-type=""bibr"">Braun and Hildebrandt, 2017</xref>; <xref rid=""B9"" ref-type=""bibr"">Bujakowska et al., 2017</xref>). The molecular mechanisms underlying the pathogenesis of these diseases are largely unknown and their analysis is challenging. In recent studies, we have identified novel functional modules associated with ADGRV1 applying affinity proteomics (<xref rid=""B33"" ref-type=""bibr"">Knapp et al., 2019</xref>; <xref rid=""B34"" ref-type=""bibr"">2022</xref>; <xref rid=""B36"" ref-type=""bibr"">Kusuluri et al., 2021</xref>; <xref rid=""B35"" ref-type=""bibr"">Krzysko et al., 2022</xref>). Here, we compared the interactomes of ADGRV1 and CIB2 identified by tandem affinity purification (TAP) and found that there was a large overlap in terms of the interacting proteins included. Interestingly, the data sets for both proteins include all eight subunits of the TRiC/CCT chaperonin complex, which is essential for the correct folding of client protein substrates such as actin and tubulin and thereby for the organization of the entire cytoskeleton (<xref rid=""B13"" ref-type=""bibr"">Dekker et al., 2008</xref>; <xref rid=""B7"" ref-type=""bibr"">Brackley and Grantham, 2009</xref>). CCT proteins are specifically enriched at the base of primary cilia, suggesting a role in cilia maintenance and/or cell cycle regulation (<xref rid=""B58"" ref-type=""bibr"">Seixas et al., 2010</xref>; <xref rid=""B59"" ref-type=""bibr"">Seo et al., 2010</xref>; <xref rid=""B37"" ref-type=""bibr"">Kypri et al., 2014</xref>). Recently, mutations in the <italic toggle=""yes"">CCT2</italic> gene have been related to LCA, a severe visual impairment beginning in infancy (<xref rid=""B49"" ref-type=""bibr"">Minegishi et al., 2016</xref>). Three gene products that are associated with Bardet-Biedl sydrome (BBS) - MKKS/BBS6, BBS10 and BBS12 - have high sequence identity with CCTs (<xref rid=""B1"" ref-type=""bibr"">Alvarez-Satta et al., 2017</xref>). Together, the BBS-type chaperones and the TRiC/CCT chaperonin complex cooperate in the assembly of the BBSome (<xref rid=""B59"" ref-type=""bibr"">Seo et al., 2010</xref>; <xref rid=""B74"" ref-type=""bibr"">Zhang et al., 2012</xref>). The BBSome is a heterooctomeric protein complex consisting of seven BBS proteins: BBS1, BBS2, BBS4, BBS5, BBS7, BBS8, BBS9, and BBIP10 protein (<xref rid=""B30"" ref-type=""bibr"">Jin and Nachury, 2009</xref>). It plays a key role in primary cilia homeostasis and is essential for the transport of cargo vesicles to primary cilia and the intraflagellar transport (IFT) of membrane cargo within the ciliary shaft (<xref rid=""B31"" ref-type=""bibr"">Jin et al., 2010</xref>). Here, we show that ADGRV1 and CIB2 are not only associated with the TRiC/CCT chaperonin complex but also bind to the three BBS chaperones. Moreover, we demonstrate that both USH proteins mutually interact and partially co-localize with the TRiC/CCT subunit CCT3 in the ciliary region of photoreceptor cells. We further demonstrate that the chaperonin complex is essential for the ciliary import of ADGRV1. Our data indicate a functional relation between protein networks involved in the pathomechanisms underlying USH, BBS and LCA.   The knowledge of the function of molecules associated with IRDs is an important prerequisite to define targets for cure and treatment. There is broad agreement in the field that the interacting partners of a protein and the associated protein networks provide clues to cellular modules and thus to the function of a protein (<xref rid=""B20"" ref-type=""bibr"">Gavin et al., 2006</xref>; <xref rid=""B5"" ref-type=""bibr"">Boldt et al., 2016</xref>). In our search for interaction partners, we have previously identified numerous putative interacting proteins of the USH2C protein ADGRV1 by applying our affinity capture proteomics strategy (<xref rid=""B34"" ref-type=""bibr"">Knapp et al., 2022</xref>). The identified molecules pointed to cellular modules in which ADGRV1 acts in concert with those molecules. Recent more detailed studies on some of these modules related to ADGRV1 demonstrated the association of ADGRV1 with focal adhesions where it is involved in mechanosensation during cell motility (<xref rid=""B36"" ref-type=""bibr"">Kusuluri et al., 2021</xref>; <xref rid=""B24"" ref-type=""bibr"">Güler et al., 2023</xref>). In addition, we showed the localization of ADGRV1 in mitochondria-associated ER membranes (MAMs), important for the maintenance of Ca<sup>2+</sup>-homeostasis (<xref rid=""B35"" ref-type=""bibr"">Krzysko et al., 2022</xref>), 2022) and that ADGRV1 controls autophagy processes and cellular proteostasis (<xref rid=""B39"" ref-type=""bibr"">Linnert et al., 2023</xref>). Moreover, others and we have previously shown that the USH2C protein ADGRV1 is part of the USH interactome interacting with both other USH2 proteins, usherin (USH2A) and whirlin (USH2D), and the two USH1 proteins myosin VIIa (USH1B) and harmonin (USH1C) (<xref rid=""B52"" ref-type=""bibr"">Reiners et al., 2005</xref>; <xref rid=""B68"" ref-type=""bibr"">van Wijk et al., 2006</xref>; <xref rid=""B47"" ref-type=""bibr"">Michalski et al., 2007</xref>; <xref rid=""B70"" ref-type=""bibr"">Wang et al., 2023</xref>). The putative USH1J protein CIB2 also interacts with the USH proteins whirlin and myosin VIIa (<xref rid=""B54"" ref-type=""bibr"">Riazuddin et al., 2012</xref>), and the interaction between ADGRV1 and CIB2 that we describe here confirms that CIB2 is part of the USH interactome. However, the present comparison of the interactomes CIB2 and ADGRV1 revealed that they not only share the USH proteins whirlin and myosin VIIa as binding proteins, but also numerous additional other interaction partners. Of the 386 putative proteins identified as interaction partners of CIB2, 270 (2/3) proteins are also reported to be binding partners of ADGRV1 (<xref rid=""B33"" ref-type=""bibr"">Knapp et al., 2019</xref>; <xref rid=""B34"" ref-type=""bibr"">Knapp et al., 2022</xref>) (<xref rid=""F1"" ref-type=""fig"">Figure 1C</xref>). Furthermore, present STRING analyses show that most of the common interaction partners of CIB2 and ADGRV1, namely, 244 proteins, are also interconnected in protein networks (<xref rid=""F1"" ref-type=""fig"">Figure 1D</xref>) and are part of functional modules, which we confirmed by GO term analyses. We conclude that the functions of CIB2 and ADGRV1 are linked and that both participate in shared processes and joint pathways in the cell. We have previously described ADGRV1 as a component of focal adhesions interacting with several of their key components such as integrins (<xref rid=""B36"" ref-type=""bibr"">Kusuluri et al., 2021</xref>; <xref rid=""B24"" ref-type=""bibr"">Güler et al., 2023</xref>). α/β-integrin heterodimers play essential roles in outside-in and/or inside-out signaling at focal adhesions (<xref rid=""B61"" ref-type=""bibr"">Shen et al., 2012</xref>; <xref rid=""B66"" ref-type=""bibr"">Sun et al., 2016</xref>). Although the binding of integrins to CIB2 is well documented and eponymous for CIB2 (<xref rid=""B12"" ref-type=""bibr"">Dal Cortivo and Dell’orco, 2022</xref>), we could not detect CIB2 at focal adhesions of murine astrocytes (<xref rid=""s12"" ref-type=""sec"">Supplementary Figure S2</xref>). The absence of CIB2 from focal adhesions of astrocytes may be due to the fact that CIB2 binds to the cytoplasmic tails of specific α-/β-integrin heterodimers, namely, αIIbβ3 and α7Bβ1 which have been previously found in platelets and megakaryocytes, and in skeletal muscles, but not related to focal adhesions so far (<xref rid=""B16"" ref-type=""bibr"">Denofrio et al., 2008</xref>; <xref rid=""B26"" ref-type=""bibr"">Häger et al., 2008</xref>). In any case, according to our data, CIB2 is not expressed in focal adhesions and, consequently, cannot be a functional partner for ADGRV1 there. Nevertheless, both CIB2 and ADGRV1 are localized at the base of primary cilia, the sensory “ciliary” outer segment of retinal photoreceptor cells and confirmed in the primary cilia model cell line of hTERT-RPE1 cells (<xref rid=""F2"" ref-type=""fig"">Figures 2D</xref>, <xref rid=""F5"" ref-type=""fig"">5E</xref>, F; <xref rid=""s12"" ref-type=""sec"">Supplementary Figure S2B</xref>). At the ciliary base of photoreceptor cells ADGRV1 has been previously identified as a component of the periciliary membrane complex (PCM) (<xref rid=""B41"" ref-type=""bibr"">Maerker et al., 2008</xref>; <xref rid=""B11"" ref-type=""bibr"">Cosgrove and Zallocchi, 2014</xref>; <xref rid=""B42"" ref-type=""bibr"">Mathur and Yang, 2015</xref>). In the PCM complex, the cytoplasmic domains of ADGRV1 and USH2A are anchored by the scaffold protein whirlin in the cytoplasm of the apical extension of the photoreceptor inner segment where myosin VIIa and USH1G protein SANS are also localized (<xref rid=""B40"" ref-type=""bibr"">Liu et al., 1997</xref>; <xref rid=""B68"" ref-type=""bibr"">van Wijk et al., 2006</xref>; <xref rid=""B41"" ref-type=""bibr"">Maerker et al., 2008</xref>). It is thought that the PCM complex is important for targeting cargos with outer segment destination to the ciliary base and the subsequent handover of these cargos to the ciliary or intraflagellar transport (IFT) systems associated with kinesin 2 or myosin VIIA in the photoreceptor cilium (<xref rid=""B41"" ref-type=""bibr"">Maerker et al., 2008</xref>; <xref rid=""B57"" ref-type=""bibr"">Sedmak and Wolfrum, 2010</xref>; <xref rid=""B43"" ref-type=""bibr"">May-Simera et al., 2017</xref>; <xref rid=""B65"" ref-type=""bibr"">Sorusch et al., 2019</xref>). The subcellular localization of CIB2 at the ciliary base together with the interaction of CIB2 to several USH proteins of the PMC suggests that CIB2 is also part of the PMC complex in photoreceptor cells. Besides the PMC the heterooctameric BBSome is localized in the periciliary region of the cilia base. There the BBSome acts as a cargo adapter for membrane proteins such as GPCRs and links cargo to the intraflagellar transport machinery (<xref rid=""B30"" ref-type=""bibr"">Jin and Nachury, 2009</xref>; <xref rid=""B38"" ref-type=""bibr"">Lechtreck et al., 2022</xref>). The BBSome is formed via intrinsic protein-protein interactions of BBS proteins of the complex with the BBS-type chaperones BBS6, BBS10 and BBS12 in cooperation with the double ring-shaped TRiC/CCT chaperonin complex (<xref rid=""F3"" ref-type=""fig"">Figures 3E</xref>, <xref rid=""F6"" ref-type=""fig"">6A</xref>) (<xref rid=""B59"" ref-type=""bibr"">Seo et al., 2010</xref>; <xref rid=""B74"" ref-type=""bibr"">Zhang et al., 2012</xref>). Here, we have demonstrated the interaction of CIB2 and ADGRV1 with both the TRiC/CCT chaperonin complex and the three BBS-type chaperones. Our data also indicate that this interaction occurs at the ciliary base which is in accordance with previous reports on the presence of CCT subunits in ciliary protein networks, which was revealed by TAP (<xref rid=""B5"" ref-type=""bibr"">Boldt et al., 2016</xref>) and other affinity proteomic screens with centrosomal and ciliary proteins (<xref rid=""B56"" ref-type=""bibr"">Sang et al., 2011</xref>; <xref rid=""B25"" ref-type=""bibr"">Gupta et al., 2015</xref>). This interaction of CIB2 and ADGRV1 with the TRiC/CCT-BBS chaperonins indicates molecular links of CIB2 and ADGRV1 to the assembly machinery of the BBSome at the base of primary cilia. Furthermore, these data suggest that CIB2 and ADGRV1 take part in chaperonin functions or alternatively both proteins may represent substrates for the chaperonin complex. Interestingly, there is growing evidence that USH protein complexes are preassembled in the ER (<xref rid=""B4"" ref-type=""bibr"">Blanco-Sánchez et al., 2014</xref>) before being transported to their final ciliary destination. It is conceivable that they are transported in a pre-folded inactive state and only achieve full functionality by TRiC/CCT-BBS-chaperonin-mediated folding when they reach the ciliary base. However, in the lack of mechanistic insights, the question of whether CIB2 and ADGRV1 are clients of the TRiC/CCT/BBS chaperone complex like the BBSome or contribute to the activity of the chaperone complex will be the subject of further investigations. This may also shed light on the possible interplay between the machineries of the BBSome and the PCM in ciliary transport. Mutations in <italic toggle=""yes"">CIB2</italic> and <italic toggle=""yes"">ADGRV1</italic> were described as causative for human USH, for the subtypes USH1J and USH2C, respectively (<xref rid=""B71"" ref-type=""bibr"">Weston et al., 2004</xref>; <xref rid=""B54"" ref-type=""bibr"">Riazuddin et al., 2012</xref>). The association between mutations in <italic toggle=""yes"">CIB2</italic> with the retinal and vestibular phenotypes in USH1 has recently been debated (<xref rid=""B12"" ref-type=""bibr"">Dal Cortivo and Dell’orco, 2022</xref>; <xref rid=""B14"" ref-type=""bibr"">Delmaghani and El-Amraoui, 2022</xref>). However, the close relation by physical interaction, the ciliary co-localization, and the shared protein interactions in a common large interactome found in the present study support a functional interplay of CIB2 and ADGRV1 in retinal photoreceptor cells. Whether this qualifies CIB2 as a USH1 gene must be determined by future studies. Are the molecular and functional connections between USH proteins, the components of the TRiC/CCT chaperone complex, and various BBS molecules relevant to ocular diseases? Our results here are consistent with the essential chaperone function of CCTs during the biogenesis of photoreceptor cilia in mice (<xref rid=""B62"" ref-type=""bibr"">Sinha et al., 2014</xref>), which is supported by the identification of mutations in <italic toggle=""yes"">CCT2</italic> causing retinal degenerations in LCA patients (<xref rid=""B49"" ref-type=""bibr"">Minegishi et al., 2016</xref>). Moreover, due to the presence of defects in photoreceptor cilia in cell and animal models for USH, evidence has been accumulating in recent years that USH is considered a retinal ciliopathy (<xref rid=""B9"" ref-type=""bibr"">Bujakowska et al., 2017</xref>; <xref rid=""B43"" ref-type=""bibr"">May-Simera et al., 2017</xref>; <xref rid=""B23"" ref-type=""bibr"">Grotz et al., 2022</xref>) which is consistent with the ciliary association of CIB2 and ADGRV1 described here. In addition, the interaction of both USH proteins with BBS molecules as well as their subcellular localization in photoreceptors may hint at a yet enigmatic function of both proteins at the periciliary membrane complex, which controls transport selectivity of proteins from the inner to the outer segment of photoreceptors via ciliary transport. We have recently observed another molecular link between USH and BBS based on the molecular interaction of the USH1G protein SANS with CEP290 (<xref rid=""B63"" ref-type=""bibr"">Sorusch et al., 2014</xref>). Like in most BBS genes mutations in <italic toggle=""yes"">CEP290,</italic> also known as <italic toggle=""yes"">BBS14</italic>, can lead to other, mostly more severe ciliopathies, such as nephronophthisis (NPHP), Meckel-Gruber syndrome (MKS), and Joubert syndrome (JBTS) but also to non-syndromic retinal dystrophies, namely, LCA (<xref rid=""B18"" ref-type=""bibr"">Forsythe and Beales, 2013</xref>; <xref rid=""B44"" ref-type=""bibr"">McConnachie et al., 2021</xref>; <xref rid=""B15"" ref-type=""bibr"">Delvallée and Dollfus, 2023</xref>). The common visual ciliary phenotype in USH, BBS, and LCA based on the diverse disease molecules participating in common pathways are most probably based on defects in ciliary modules such as post-translational modification by chaperonin complexes. The association of CIB2 and ADGRV1 with a larger ciliary network shared by USH, BBS, and certain forms of LCA, strongly suggests a role of both proteins in ciliary cargo selection and transport. This is further supported by the fact that mutations in these proteins affect both rod and cone photoreceptors. The overlapping protein networks of both syndromic retinal dystrophies BBS and USH suggest shared pathomechanisms for both syndromes on the molecular level, which bears the chance to identify common therapeutic targets for the correction of the causative defects in a mutation-independent fashion in patients affected by these ciliopathies.",N/A,22 6 2023
Rescue of hearing by adenine base editing in a humanized mouse model of Usher syndrome type 1F,"Usher syndrome type 1F (USH1F), characterized by congenital lack of hearing and balance and progressive loss of vision, is caused by mutations in the <italic toggle=""yes"">PCDH15</italic> gene. In the Ashkenazi population, a recessive truncation mutation accounts for a large proportion of USH1F cases. The truncation is caused by a single C→T mutation, which converts an arginine codon to a stop (R245X). To test the potential for base editors to revert this mutation, we developed a humanized <italic toggle=""yes"">Pcdh15</italic><sup>R245X</sup> mouse model for USH1F. Mice homozygous for the R245X mutation were deaf and exhibited profound balance deficits, while heterozygous mice were unaffected. Here we show that an adenine base editor (ABE) is capable of reversing the R245X mutation to restore the PCDH15 sequence and function. We packaged a split-intein ABE into dual adeno-associated virus (AAV) vectors and delivered them into cochleas of neonatal USH1F mice. Hearing was not restored in a <italic toggle=""yes"">Pcdh15</italic> constitutive null mouse despite base editing, perhaps because of early disorganization of cochlear hair cells. However, injection of vectors encoding the split ABE into a late-deletion conditional <italic toggle=""yes"">Pcdh15</italic> knockout rescued hearing. This study demonstrates the ability of an ABE to correct the <italic toggle=""yes"">PCDH15</italic> R245X mutation in the cochlea and restore hearing.  The p.R245X mutation in human PCDH15 causes the deafness and blindness characteristics of Usher syndrome type 1F. Corey and colleagues created a humanized R245X mouse model of Usher syndrome type 1F and used dual AAVs to deliver adenine base editors to correct the mutation in the inner ear, partially restoring hearing.",Full text not available in PMC,N/A,02 8 2023
Evaluation of Sleep Quality and Fatigue in Patients with Usher Syndrome Type 2a,,"  In this study, the prevalence, level, and nature of sleep problems and fatigue in USH2a patients were investigated<italic toggle=""yes"">.</italic> In addition, the relationship between these measures and the level of visual dysfunction was studied<italic toggle=""yes"">.</italic> Compared with the control population, USH2a patients scored significantly worse on all 4 studied parameters: sleep quality, sleep disorders, fatigue, and daytime sleepiness. No differences in chronotype of USH2a patients and controls were seen. Interestingly, this study showed that sleep disturbances and high levels of fatigue experienced by USH2a patients were not correlated to their level of visual impairment. These results were in accordance with the patients’ experiences that their sleep problems already existed before the onset of vision loss. In the PSQI, the global score of the control population had an average of 4.9 and a median of 4.5. With the cutoff for poor sleep quality set at 5.0 by the creators of this questionnaire,<xref rid=""bib19"" ref-type=""bibr""><sup>18</sup></xref> the average control participant was already almost classified as a person experiencing poor sleep. In the original publication from 1989, the 52 control participants had a global PSQI score of 2.64 ± 1.70. It should be noted that this control population consisted of participants described as “good sleepers” based on participation in other studies.<xref rid=""bib19"" ref-type=""bibr""><sup>18</sup></xref> In more recent studies, a high global PSQI score is common. For example, in the study of Hayashino et al,<xref rid=""bib32"" ref-type=""bibr""><sup>31</sup></xref> the 1187 control participants with 0 comorbid conditions had an average score of 4.53 ± 2.25. In the study of Bøe Lunde et al,<xref rid=""bib33"" ref-type=""bibr""><sup>32</sup></xref> the control population without multiple sclerosis even scored 6.36 ± 4.1 (n = 108). In the study of Barrea et al,<xref rid=""bib34"" ref-type=""bibr""><sup>33</sup></xref> the baseline survey of participants prequarantine had a global PSQI score of 6.37 ± 3.96 (n = 121). The systematic review of Lee et al<xref rid=""bib35"" ref-type=""bibr""><sup>34</sup></xref> showed that, whereas most studies used the original cutoff score of 5, a cutoff value of 8 was also chosen in some studies. Based on these results, it could be argued that the PSQI cutoff value is too stringent. However, independent of a chosen cutoff, the large significant increase in global PSQI scores of USH2a patients compared with the control population remains a valuable outcome. The importance of light as a synchronizer of circadian rhythmicity has been well-known for many decades.<xref rid=""bib36"" ref-type=""bibr""><sup>35</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid=""bib37"" ref-type=""bibr""><sup>36</sup></xref> Although there are plenty of studies that recognize the high prevalence of sleep–wake disorders in the blind community<xref rid=""bib12"" ref-type=""bibr""><sup>12</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid=""bib38"" ref-type=""bibr""><sup>37</sup></xref> or in patients with RP in particular,<xref rid=""bib13"" ref-type=""bibr""><sup>13</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid=""bib39"" ref-type=""bibr""><sup>38</sup></xref> the relation between USH, sleep, and circadian rhythm is still underexposed. To our knowledge, this is the first study specifically addressing and quantifying sleep disturbances and disorders in USH patients. However, there have been previous studies briefly appointing similar observations. The first is the study by Dammeyer<xref rid=""bib14"" ref-type=""bibr""><sup>14</sup></xref> on the development and characteristics of children with USH. Although sleep was only a minor element of the study, a high prevalence of sleep problems, mainly in patients clinically diagnosed with USH1 and USH2, was observed, as well as the finding that this comorbidity occurs before complete loss of vision. Second, an independent study by Wahlqvist et al<xref rid=""bib16"" ref-type=""bibr""><sup>16</sup></xref> studied the physical and psychological health in USH2 patients. It was found that the level of fatigue was significantly higher in USH2 patients compared with the reference group. However, in their paper, sleep quality was not investigated, but fatigue was framed as one of the symptoms of poor psychological health. Third, in a study by Ehn et al,<xref rid=""bib15"" ref-type=""bibr""><sup>15</sup></xref> the relationship between work and health in persons with USH2 was reported. Sleep problems were identified in both the working group and the disability pension group, but the data were not compared with the healthy population. Last, in-depth interviews with 7 USH2 patients revealed that they generally have low energy levels and have to prioritize certain activities and take sufficient time to recover. This study did not focus on sleep, but physical and mental symptoms such as “constant fatigue” were described as common. It was stated that “Fatigue and stress were previously reported as the most prominent health problems among people with USH2,<xref rid=""bib16"" ref-type=""bibr""><sup>16</sup></xref> and stress and fatigue were found to be common in both actively working and nonworking people with USH2.<xref rid=""bib15"" ref-type=""bibr""><sup>15</sup></xref> This indicates that stress or fatigue may be related to other factors outside of working life.”<xref rid=""bib40"" ref-type=""bibr""><sup>39</sup></xref> Although these studies either used a small sample size, poorly differentiated between genetic etiology of USH, or did not consider the factors in disease progression, they provide additional evidence of sleep problems and fatigue in USH patients. Although never studied before in such detail, the results obtained in this study are solely based on questionnaires. One of the risks of these types of studies is an enrichment for participants that experience the topic of investigation because they are more keen to participate to share their problems. To reduce this potential bias, it was clearly communicated that patients without sleep problems could also participate. In addition, control participants with known sleep problems were not excluded from participation to represent the general population as accurately as possible. Also, although extensively validated, questionnaires only reflect a subjective measure of sleep. However, fatigue and sleep quality are challenging to measure objectively, due to their inherent subjective nature.<xref rid=""bib41"" ref-type=""bibr""><sup>40</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid=""bib42"" ref-type=""bibr""><sup>41</sup></xref> All results from this study point toward a high prevalence of sleep disturbances and fatigue in USH patients. No correlation was found between the experienced fatigue or daytime sleepiness and poor sleep quality. Most notably, the level of visual impairment of USH patients does not seem to be the explanation for the sleep problems, and the cause is still to be scrutinized. One possible cause might be poor psychological health, because mental health and sleep are known to be closely linked.<xref rid=""bib43"" ref-type=""bibr""><sup>42</sup></xref> However, in that case, it would be expected that young presymptomatic USH2a patients—still unaware of the consequences of their disease and not visually impaired yet—would experience fewer sleep problems, whereas the study of Dammeyer<xref rid=""bib14"" ref-type=""bibr""><sup>14</sup></xref> showed they do actually already suffer from poor sleep. For a potential follow-up study, it would be intriguing to study the sleep problems of presymptomatic USH2a patients in more detail. For example, the Children’s Sleep Habits Questionnaire could be distributed among the parents or caretakers of children diagnosed with USH2a who are presymptomatic for vision loss.<xref rid=""bib44"" ref-type=""bibr""><sup>43</sup></xref> Another way to address mental health as a confounding factor is to include an evaluation of psychological health in follow-up studies (e.g., the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale).<xref rid=""bib45"" ref-type=""bibr""><sup>44</sup></xref> Potential other confounders could be sex, body mass index, and activity or lifestyle. In addition, it should be noted that all questionnaires used in this study focused on the general or average experience of sleep during the last weeks or months. In this study, all data were collected during winter. It could be that some measures have a different outcome in summer because there are sleep parameters that are known to fluctuate seasonally.<xref rid=""bib46"" ref-type=""bibr""><sup>45</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid=""bib47"" ref-type=""bibr""><sup>46</sup></xref> To rule out seasonal influences, data from the patients and control population were collected during the same period. In addition to seasonal differences, it is also possible to examine day-to-day fluctuations. To study sleep problems in even more detail and monitor day-to-day differences, the use of an actigraphy device or daily sleep diary, such as the consensus sleep diary, would be helpful.<xref rid=""bib48"" ref-type=""bibr""><sup>47</sup></xref> In such a study, several lifestyle parameters, such as the amount of activity, caffeine intake, and day-to-day fluctuations of bedtime could be considered. If follow-up experiments exclude psychological health and lifestyle as a cause of sleep disturbances, it would be useful to study more fundamental biological processes such as the circadian melatonin rhythm. In this study, only USH2a patients were included to have the best stratified study population possible to be subjected to extensive sleep questionnaires. Currently, it is unknown whether patients with other (sub)types of USH also experience sleep problems. The study of Ehn et al<xref rid=""bib15"" ref-type=""bibr""><sup>15</sup></xref> focused on USH2, without making a distinction between USH2A, USH type 2C, and USH type 2D subtypes. Wahlqvist et al<xref rid=""bib16"" ref-type=""bibr""><sup>16</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid=""bib17"" ref-type=""bibr""><sup>17</sup></xref> reported 2 studies: 1 on USH2 and 1 on USH1 (again without separating the different subtypes). The study of Dammeyer<xref rid=""bib14"" ref-type=""bibr""><sup>14</sup></xref> included both USH1 and USH2 patients. Usher syndrome proteins are known to interact with each other, forming complex protein networks.<xref rid=""bib1"" ref-type=""bibr""><sup>1</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid=""bib49"" ref-type=""bibr""><sup>48</sup></xref> Therefore, it would be intriguing to study the prevalence of sleep problems in other types or subtypes of USH as well. In addition, it would be valuable to compare these results to the sleep phenotype of cases with nonsyndromic RP, for example, nonsyndromic RP caused by pathogenic variants in the <italic toggle=""yes"">EYS</italic> gene (which is the second most frequent cause of nonsyndromic RP),<xref rid=""bib50"" ref-type=""bibr""><sup>49</sup></xref> or nonsyndromic RP resulting from pathogenic variants in the USH2A gene.<xref rid=""bib31"" ref-type=""bibr""><sup>30</sup></xref> Last, as opposed to other types of USH or RP, it would be worthwhile examining a potential genotype–phenotype correlation between the type of pathogenic variants and the severity of the experienced sleep problems. Expanding this research to different USH (sub)types, different nonsyndromic types of RP, or the type of pathogenic variants could have multiple benefits and applications. It will not only contribute to the recognition of sleep problems among the broader USH or RP population but, also, to a better understanding of the biological process underlying these sleep problems. Based on the abovementioned studies and the results of our own study, we advocate that poor sleep quality and fatigue are highly prevalent within the USH2a population, which we feel should be added as a listed comorbidity. Recognition of sleep problems as a comorbidity would be the first step toward improved patient care. The absence of a relationship between the level of visual impairment and the severity of reported sleep problems suggests a different origin of sleep problems in the USH2a population than for the general blind community. Further research should investigate whether this phenomenon also holds true for other subtypes of USH. Unraveling the potential extraretinal origin of the sleep disturbances experienced by USH2a patients will be an important next subject for future studies.",N/A,05 5 2023
Mini-PCDH15 gene therapy rescues hearing in a mouse model of Usher syndrome type 1F,"Usher syndrome type 1 F (USH1F), caused by mutations in the protocadherin-15 gene (<italic toggle=""yes"">PCDH15</italic>), is characterized by congenital deafness, lack of balance, and progressive blindness. In hair cells, the receptor cells of the inner ear, PCDH15 is a component of tip links, fine filaments which pull open mechanosensory transduction channels. A simple gene addition therapy for USH1F is challenging because the PCDH15 coding sequence is too large for adeno-associated virus (AAV) vectors. We use rational, structure-based design to engineer mini-PCDH15s in which 3–5 of the 11 extracellular cadherin repeats are deleted, but which still bind a partner protein. Some mini-PCDH15s can fit in an AAV. An AAV encoding one of these, injected into the inner ears of mouse models of USH1F, produces a mini-PCDH15 which properly forms tip links, prevents the degeneration of hair cell bundles, and rescues hearing. Mini-PCDH15s may be a useful therapy for the deafness of USH1F. Mutations in PCDH15 cause deafness and blindness in Usher syndrome 1 F, but gene therapy is difficult because the PCDH15 sequence is too large for AAV vectors. Here, the authors engineered a miniPCDH15 that fits in AAV and rescues hearing in mouse Usher syndrome 1F models.","Advances in gene therapy have positioned adeno-associated viruses (AAV) as a ubiquitous delivery tool for treating monogenic inherited disorders<sup><xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR1"">1</xref>–<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR3"">3</xref></sup>. Their low toxicity and immunogenicity minimize adverse reactions and they produce long-term transgene expression. Furthermore, various AAV serotypes and variants display broad but distinct tropisms that allow targeting to specific cell types<sup><xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR4"">4</xref>–<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR7"">7</xref></sup>. Capsid design and discovery efforts have dramatically improved AAV transduction rates, particularly in neuronal tissues<sup><xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR1"">1</xref>–<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR8"">8</xref></sup>. However AAVs remain limited by their capsid packaging capacity, which only allows transport of ~5 kb of genetic material. Elements such as promoters, polyadenylation sequences, and other regulatory elements further limit the size of transgenes that can be packaged. Dual and triple AAV approaches are options for circumventing this drawback; however they rely on co-transduction of multiple viral particles in the same cell, and on efficient intracellular recombination of the viral DNA or expressed proteins<sup><xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR9"">9</xref>–<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR11"">11</xref></sup>. A less common approach is to use rational protein design to generate shortened versions of the protein of interest. This strategy has been employed to develop mini- and micro-dystrophins to treat Duchenne muscular dystrophy, based on the observation that large deletions in the dystrophin gene are generally well tolerated<sup><xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR12"">12</xref></sup>. More recently, mini-otoferlin genes have been used to probe the role of the protein in hair-cell endocytosis in the cochlea<sup><xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR13"">13</xref>,<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR14"">14</xref></sup>, mini-<italic toggle=""yes"">CEP290</italic> genes have been evaluated for treating CEP290-associated Leber congenital amaurosis<sup><xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR15"">15</xref></sup>, and a “condensed” form of human tuberin (cTuberin) designed for treating tuberous sclerosis complex<sup><xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR16"">16</xref></sup>. However a significant challenge for minigenes is the need to understand the protein structure and binding partners well enough to delete non-essential domains while preserving function, especially when function may include resisting large forces. Over the past decade, we and others have elucidated the molecular structure, function, and interactome of PCDH15<sup><xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR17"">17</xref>–<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR28"">28</xref></sup>. This protein is a large, atypical cadherin with 11 link-like extracellular cadherin (EC) repeats and a membrane adjacent domain (MAD12) preceding its single transmembrane domain<sup><xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR22"">22</xref>,<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR29"">29</xref></sup>. Serving as the lower portion of the tip link in mature inner ear hair cells, PCDH15 binds to cadherin 23 (CDH23)<sup><xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR22"">22</xref>,<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR26"">26</xref></sup> to convey force from sound stimuli to the mechanosensory transduction channels<sup><xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR30"">30</xref>,<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR31"">31</xref></sup>. It also forms transient lateral and kinocilial links, critical for hair bundle development and planar cell polarity<sup><xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR17"">17</xref>,<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR21"">21</xref>,<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR25"">25</xref></sup>, and is expressed in retinal photoreceptors and in auditory cortex interneurons<sup><xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR32"">32</xref>,<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR33"">33</xref></sup>. In humans, mutations in <italic toggle=""yes"">PCDH15</italic> can cause isolated deafness or Usher syndrome type 1 F (USH1F). Usher syndrome (USH) is the most common cause of deaf-blindness worldwide. It is both genetically and clinically heterogeneous. Patients with the most severe forms of Usher syndrome, known as type 1 (USH1), experience profound congenital hearing loss and severe balance deficits. Additionally, USH1 patients develop prepubertal retinitis pigmentosa (RP), which progresses to nearly complete blindness by the fifth decade<sup><xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR34"">34</xref>,<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR35"">35</xref></sup>. USH1F represents roughly 3–11% of all Usher syndrome cases<sup><xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR36"">36</xref>,<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR37"">37</xref></sup>. PCDH15 has three alternatively spliced C-termini: CD1, CD2 and CD3, but only the CD2 splice form is necessary for PCDH15 function in hair cells in mice<sup><xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR23"">23</xref>,<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR25"">25</xref></sup>. <italic toggle=""yes"">PCDH15-CD2</italic> has a ~5.3 kb coding sequence, too large for an AAV capsid. In this work, we used our structural knowledge of PCDH15 to eliminate 3–5 EC repeats while retaining PCDH15 function, in order to package the coding sequence into a single AAV capsid. After characterizing eight such mini-PCDH15 versions in vitro and optimizing AAV expression cassettes for inner ear hair cells, we tested their function in vivo in three USH1F mouse models. One version, mini-PCDH15 version 4 (mini-PCDH15-V4), demonstrated proper protein localization and remarkable rescue of hearing. Our data suggest that mini-PCDH15 proteins can be used for treating deafness in USH1F patients, and could be tested as a therapy to treat blindness. Furthermore, this work demonstrates that shortened versions of genes may be used to treat other forms of hereditary hearing loss for which the gene product is too large for AAV’s packaging limit.  We and others have made significant advances in gene therapy for deafness, primarily with gene addition therapy for small genes whose coding sequences fit in a single AAV vector<sup><xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR3"">3</xref>,<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR5"">5</xref>–<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR7"">7</xref>,<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR55"">55</xref>,<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR56"">56</xref></sup>. However, some deafness genes—including many that cause Usher syndrome—encode large proteins with coding sequences that will not fit in AAV. More creative approaches must be developed to express therapeutic proteins in the target cells<sup><xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR57"">57</xref>,<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR58"">58</xref></sup>. In this study we rationally engineered eight mini-PCDH15 genes that lack 3–5 EC repeats to shorten the coding sequence. The design of mini-PCDH15 constructs was based on our previously solved atomistic structures of PCDH15<sup><xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR18"">18</xref>,<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR19"">19</xref>,<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR27"">27</xref></sup>. In all the mini-PCDH15s that we designed, EC1-3 and EC11-MAD12 regions were included to retain the parallel dimerization of PCDH15. Four of the eight minis retained the EC9-10 linker suggested to be key for PCDH15 flexibility and elasticity<sup><xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR18"">18</xref>,<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR38"">38</xref></sup>. Middle EC repeats of the PCDH15 extracellular domain were deleted in various combinations based on their structural variability and protein sequence conservation<sup><xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR18"">18</xref></sup>, creating synthetic EC-EC junctions. As the strength of PCDH15 depends on Ca<sup>2+</sup> ions bridging acidic residues<sup><xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR27"">27</xref></sup>, the proper design of each synthetic junction was critical. The template-free structure prediction of monomeric mini-PCDH15s performed by the AlphaFold2 program gave models with high confidence (median pLDDT ~95), similar to structures of PCDH15 fragments solved previously with high-resolution X-ray crystallography<sup><xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR18"">18</xref>–<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR20"">20</xref>,<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR24"">24</xref>,<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR27"">27</xref>,<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR38"">38</xref></sup> and to chimeric models with artificial EC-EC junctions<sup><xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR38"">38</xref></sup>, supporting the expectation that mini-PCDH15s would retain similar structural conformation as the wild-type PCDH15 protein. For this study, we chose the AAV9-PHP.B capsid for delivery because it transduces IHCs and OHCs in mouse and non-human primate cochleas and has the potential for clinical delivery<sup><xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR5"">5</xref>,<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR6"">6</xref>,<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR53"">53</xref></sup>. To expand the size of transgenes packageable in AAV9-PHP.B, we explored options to minimize the size of the expression cassette to allow more space for the transgene. An expression cassette with a CMV promoter and BGH poly(A) sequence but no WPRE showed transduction and expression efficiency comparable to our previous vector<sup><xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR5"">5</xref>,<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR6"">6</xref></sup> and left enough space to package all three mini-PCDH15 versions tested. To test mini-PCDH15s in vivo, we generated two conditional knockout models. In both, exon 31—encoding the transmembrane domain and part of PCDH15’s MAD12 domain—was deleted, but they differ in the onset of Cre activation. While both were deaf at P35, we found that early deletion by <italic toggle=""yes"">Gfi1-Cre</italic> resulted in stereocilia bundles that were severely disorganized at P6, near the time of AAV injection at P1. The hair bundles developed normally when the Cre was driven by the late-onset hair cell-specific <italic toggle=""yes"">Myo15</italic> promoter, allowing us to test and differentiate mini-PCDH15 variants functionally. The three shortest mini-PCDH15s—versions 4, 7, and 8—were packaged into AAV9-PHP.B and injected at P1 into <italic toggle=""yes"">Myo15-Cre</italic> conditional knockout mice. Two versions restored hearing function in vivo. Intriguingly, treatment with AAV-mini-PCDH15-V4, which had only one synthetic EC junction (EC3-EC9) and retained the flexible EC9-10 junction, showed strong hearing rescue and no toxicity, with rescue durable for at least two months. AAV-mini-PCDH15-V7, which had two synthetic junctions (EC3-EC7; EC8-EC11) and no EC9-10 repeats, showed only partial rescue and caused severe hearing loss in <italic toggle=""yes"">Pcdh15</italic><sup><italic toggle=""yes"">fl/fl</italic></sup> control mice. Similarly, the non-functional mini-PCDH15-V8 had two synthetic junctions (EC4-EC7 and EC7-EC11) and no EC9-10 repeats. Perhaps the presence of two synthetic EC-repeat junctions in mini-PCDH15-V7 and mini-PCDH15-V8 affects parallel dimerization mediated by EC1-3 and EC11-MAD12, or perhaps synthetic junctions between some EC repeats were not properly stabilized by Ca<sup>2+</sup>. It is also possible that the flexible EC9-10 linker contributes to the proper assembly, elasticity, and function of mini-PCDH15 tip links and they are not stable without it. Structural studies of these mini-PCDH15s could provide insight for engineering even more efficacious versions. Scanning electron microscopy and immunofluorescence further verified rescue by mini-PCDH15-V4 at P35. Nearly all hair cells (80–88%) maintained normal hair-cell bundle morphology in apical and middle regions. Furthermore, mini-PCDH15-V4 formed tip links properly located at the tips of short and middle row stereocilia, as clearly visualized with immunofluorescence microscopy and with conventional and immunogold scanning electron microscopy. Interestingly, even though the expression of eGFP with AAV9-PHP.B was relatively high in the base, the rescue level was highest in the apical and middle regions of the cochlea and significantly lower in the base, suggesting that the efficiency of eGFP expression did not directly correlate with the efficiency of PCDH15 expression. We first used a late-onset <italic toggle=""yes"">Myo15-Cre</italic> mouse model, which allowed normal hair cell morphology at the time of mini-PCDH15 treatment and before endogenous PCDH15 deletion, as a platform for evaluating the relative efficacy of the different mini-PCDH15 versions. We then evaluated the best performer in a mouse model with earlier <italic toggle=""yes"">Pcdh15</italic> deletion. In <italic toggle=""yes"">Pcdh15</italic><sup><italic toggle=""yes"">fl/fl</italic></sup><italic toggle=""yes"">,Gfi1-Cre</italic><sup><italic toggle=""yes"">+/−</italic></sup> mice the <italic toggle=""yes"">Pcdh15</italic> deletion occurred before complete hair bundle development. This mouse model had severely disrupted hair bundles similar to those described previously in null <italic toggle=""yes"">Pcdh15</italic><sup><italic toggle=""yes"">Av3J</italic></sup> mice<sup><xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR50"">50</xref></sup>. Nevertheless, the treatment with the best mini-PCDH15 version showed rescue of ABR, with threshold improved by ~50 dB. This is encouraging and suggests that treatment of USH1F deafness caused by milder mutations (e.g. R134G, G262D and V528D)<sup><xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR44"">44</xref>,<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR59"">59</xref></sup> may be treatable with mini-PCDH15s. To further validate the clinical relevance of this approach, we sought to test it using a mouse line bearing a mutation carried by USH1F patients. In the Ashkenazi population, a single nonsense variant (p.R245X) accounts for 64% of cases, so we used a <italic toggle=""yes"">Pcdh15</italic><sup><italic toggle=""yes"">R245X</italic></sup> constitutive knockout mouse line, which mimics the human genotype. Mice were profoundly deaf and they had no expression of PCDH15 at any time, which led to severe disruption of hair-bundle morphology, absence of tip links, and the complete loss of mechanotransduction. Treatment of <italic toggle=""yes"">Pcdh15</italic><sup><italic toggle=""yes"">R245X</italic></sup> constitutive knockout mice at P0-P1 with AAV-mini-PCDH15-V4 partially rescued the phenotype. The tip links were clearly detected in treated P6 mice. Immunofluorescence and immunogold scanning electron microscopy labeling further confirmed the proper trafficking and localization of mini-PCDH15-V4. We were able to restore the mechanotransduction current and FM1-43 loading in cells expressing mini-PCDH15-V4. Finally, the evaluation of ABRs showed encouraging hearing rescue, with ABR thresholds improved by up to 40 dB. Delivery of a functional coding sequence at P0 was not sufficient to restore bundle morphology, however, so the incomplete rescue likely reflects the performance of well-functioning tip links on poorly organized stereocilia. While AAV injection in the mouse inner ear may provide insights into potential therapies for congenital hearing loss, it may not necessarily translate directly to humans. The human inner ear develops on a different timescale relative to birth than that of mice, and there may be differences in the optimal timing, dosage, and delivery method of AAV vectors. The window of therapeutic efficacy for humans may close one week prior to hearing onset at 18 weeks gestational age, based on the postnatal window of efficacy observed in mice<sup><xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR60"">60</xref></sup>, and intervention beyond this critical period may not be as effective in restoring hearing. However, some mild mutations (e.g., R134G, G262D, and V528D) are not deleterious to balance and vision and are associated with late-onset hearing loss, which can potentially be treated<sup><xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR44"">44</xref>,<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR59"">59</xref></sup>. In addition, vestibular hair cells, in particular, may be more responsive to therapy, as they continue to differentiate even after birth in mice<sup><xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR60"">60</xref></sup>. Thus, early intervention targeting a subset of vestibular hair cells may be possible. However, the most promising initial therapeutic target for Usher 1 F is progressive blindness. Fortunately, the progression of blindness in Usher 1 F occurs gradually over several decades, providing a sizable window of opportunity for treatment<sup><xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR34"">34</xref>,<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR35"">35</xref>,<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR61"">61</xref>,<xref ref-type=""bibr"" rid=""CR62"">62</xref></sup>. Altogether, testing a mini-PCDH15 approach in three different mouse models helped us better understand how the timing of mini-PCDH15 treatment—before PCDH15 deletion, after PCDH15 deletion, or when no PCDH15 is expressed—affects the rescue level, providing more relevant data for their clinical translation in patients with USH1F. Mini-PCDH15 may also be a viable therapeutic option for addressing blindness. Finally, this study demonstrates that minigenes might be used to treat other forms of hereditary hearing loss for which the coding sequence is too large for AAV’s packaging limit.  ",N/A,26 4 2023
"A Review of CRISPR Tools for Treating Usher Syndrome: Applicability, Safety, Efficiency, and In Vivo Delivery","This review considers research into the treatment of Usher syndrome, a deaf-blindness syndrome inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. Usher syndrome mutations are markedly heterogeneous, involving many different genes, and research grants are limited due to minimal patient populations. Furthermore, gene augmentation therapies are impossible in all but three Usher syndromes as the cDNA sequence exceeds the 4.7 kb AAV packaging limit. It is, therefore, vital to focus research efforts on alternative tools with the broadest applicability. The CRISPR field took off in recent years following the discovery of the DNA editing activity of Cas9 in 2012. New generations of CRISPR tools have succeeded the original CRISPR/Cas9 model to enable more sophisticated genomic amendments such as epigenetic modification and precise sequence alterations. This review will evaluate the most popular CRISPR tools to date: CRISPR/Cas9, base editing, and prime editing. It will consider these tools in terms of applicability (in relation to the ten most prevalent <italic toggle=""yes"">USH2A</italic> mutations), safety, efficiency, and in vivo delivery potential with the intention of guiding future research investment.","Research into rare diseases often encounters barriers to funding due to the lack of commercial interest in small patient populations. Consequently, it is important to develop tools that have broad applicability. Usher syndrome is a rare disease with a prevalence that varies according to locality—in the USA, estimated at ~4.4:100,000 [<xref rid=""B1-ijms-24-07603"" ref-type=""bibr"">1</xref>]. This review focuses on Usher syndrome due to its frequency among inherited retinal degenerations and the lack of current treatment modalities. Moreover, the eye is an appealing target due to its accessibility, relative immune privilege, and numerous clinical outcome measures. Usher Syndrome, first described by Charles Usher in 1914 [<xref rid=""B2-ijms-24-07603"" ref-type=""bibr"">2</xref>], is a deaf-blindness syndrome inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. Patients are placed into one of three categories based on the severity of their signs. Type 1 Usher patients display the most debilitating signs with vestibular dysfunction, pre-pubertal onset of retinitis pigmentosa (RP), and pronounced congenital hearing deficits. Usher Syndrome type 2 patients typically have preserved vestibular function, moderate congenital hearing loss, and RP onset before the third decade of life (<xref rid=""ijms-24-07603-f001"" ref-type=""fig"">Figure 1</xref>). Type 3 Usher patients have greater variability with respect to vestibular function and severity/onset of RP. They display congenital or early onset progressive hearing impairment and are concentrated mainly in Finland [<xref rid=""B3-ijms-24-07603"" ref-type=""bibr"">3</xref>,<xref rid=""B4-ijms-24-07603"" ref-type=""bibr"">4</xref>]. The focus of the review is Usher Syndrome Type 2A since mutations within <italic toggle=""yes"">USH2A</italic> account for over 50% of Usher Syndrome cases and up to 79% of Usher 2 patients [<xref rid=""B5-ijms-24-07603"" ref-type=""bibr"">5</xref>,<xref rid=""B6-ijms-24-07603"" ref-type=""bibr"">6</xref>]. Three genes have been associated with Usher Syndrome type 2: <italic toggle=""yes"">USH2A</italic>, <italic toggle=""yes"">ADGRV1,</italic> and <italic toggle=""yes"">WHRN</italic>, which together comprise the periciliary membrane complex at the junction between the inner and outer photoreceptor segment [<xref rid=""B1-ijms-24-07603"" ref-type=""bibr"">1</xref>]. The mutations within <italic toggle=""yes"">USH2A</italic> result in a non-functional protein. The function of usherin, encoded by the <italic toggle=""yes"">USH2A</italic> gene, is not fully understood. However, some purported ideas include a role in transducing mechanical stress, docking/membrane fusion of post-Golgi vesicles, structural maintenance, or acting as a diffusion barrier between the cell body and connecting cilium [<xref rid=""B7-ijms-24-07603"" ref-type=""bibr"">7</xref>,<xref rid=""B8-ijms-24-07603"" ref-type=""bibr"">8</xref>]. Regardless of the exact mechanism, pathogenic mutations within <italic toggle=""yes"">USH2A</italic> result in the defective development of cochlear hair cells and the maintenance of photoreceptor cells [<xref rid=""B1-ijms-24-07603"" ref-type=""bibr"">1</xref>]. Some gene therapeutics targeting Usher syndrome have progressed to clinical trials. The gene replacement therapy ‘UshStat’ delivers <italic toggle=""yes"">MYO7A</italic> cDNA within a lentiviral vector into Usher type 1 patients. The trial reached phase 1/2a (NCT 01505062), however, was prematurely terminated. The ProQR trial has made more headway: the antisense oligonucleotide (QR-421a) binds to an mRNA splice site, causing the translation machinery to skip over exon 13 in the <italic toggle=""yes"">USH2A</italic> gene. This trial has progressed to phase 1/2 with evidence of effectiveness (NCT 03780257). However, the ProQR treatment has limited applicability, only targeting mutations within exon 13. Additionally, skipping certain exons results in a deleterious frameshift, and the treatment effect is temporary. A widely applicable, safe, and effective treatment does not currently exist for patients with Usher Syndrome. The cDNA sequence of the <italic toggle=""yes"">USH2A</italic> gene (15.7 kb) exceeds the 4.7 kb packaging limit of AAV, eliminating the possibility of previously characterised gene augmentation approaches. Consequently, CRISPR (clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats) treatments that edit the mutation at the DNA or RNA level are being explored. Moreover, there are limitations to gene replacement therapies that encourage the exploration of alternative treatments. Exogenously expressed transgenes demonstrate a declining treatment effect, and theories for this include the silencing of the exogenous transgene and cellular stress from products of the mutant allele [<xref rid=""B9-ijms-24-07603"" ref-type=""bibr"">9</xref>,<xref rid=""B10-ijms-24-07603"" ref-type=""bibr"">10</xref>]. This review evaluates the three CRISPR technologies in most frequent use: CRISPR/Cas9, base editing, and prime editing, for their potential to secure research funding for Usher Syndrome. The review will provide a summary of each tool, then proceed to explore their therapeutic potential in terms of applicability to combat thousands of described pathogenic <italic toggle=""yes"">USH2A</italic> mutations, safety, efficiency, and ease of in vivo delivery. CRISPR represents a form of prokaryotic adaptive immunity employed by bacteria and archaea, which has been repurposed for use in gene therapeutics. Prokaryotes store short DNA sequences derived from invading bacteriophages. A variety of species-specific Cas proteins use the short DNA sequences as a guide to bind and cleave complementary bacteriophage DNA in the event of repeat invasions. The CRISPR/Cas9 system is the original prototype that has undergone successive modifications to generate other popular gene therapy tools such as CRISPR interference/activation, base editors, and prime editors. All three CRISPR technologies have strong potential to treat patients with Usher Syndrome. The review will now consider which tool has the greatest potential for treating the largest patient group impacted by mutations within the <italic toggle=""yes"">USH2A</italic> gene (<xref rid=""ijms-24-07603-t001"" ref-type=""table"">Table 1</xref>). In vitro experiments in relevant cells would be required to justify the use of these technologies at the gene therapy level. It is important that the tool selected can accomplish levels of genomic editing sufficient for therapeutic rescue in vivo. The review will now discuss the potential of each tool in this respect. Concerns are constantly raised over the safety implications of permanently editing patient DNA, particularly when considering vertical transmission (germline modification). Concerns typically relate to unwanted, often cumulative, off-target effects that could have serious unpredictable consequences, including tumorigenesis. It is important to weigh the cost/benefit related to a patient with a severely debilitating condition, and informed personal choice should play a role. It is also vital to select a tool that minimises off-target modifications with predictable action.  Many genetic diseases, including Usher Syndrome, are characterised by a markedly heterogeneous database of mutations. The result is that clinical trials will struggle to acquire funding for treatments with a narrow reach directed toward rarer variants. An approach to maximise funding would be to focus on treatments with broad applicability that can be easily adapted to different mutations. Prime editing has the broadest applicability of all current CRISPR technologies and represents a promising focus for future research efforts. It can correct all ten of the most common mutations in the <italic toggle=""yes"">USH2A</italic> gene due to its ability to mediate all base transitions as well as small deletions and insertions. In contrast, the CRISPR/Cas9 system can only definitively correct four of the ten most common <italic toggle=""yes"">USH2A</italic> mutations via intronic deletions and has the potential to correct five more depending on the importance of the involved exon to protein function. The precise correction is possible with prime editing but is unlikely to be a viable option with CRISPR/Cas9 strategies since HDR is very inefficient in non-dividing cells such as photoreceptors. Base editing can correct eight of the ten most common <italic toggle=""yes"">USH2A</italic> mutations, although some of these edits would mediate a conservative amino acid change rather than an exact reversion to the original codon. The remaining two mutations are not targetable with base editors since they are unable to correct deletions or insertions. In terms of therapeutic potential, safety and efficiency are also important considerations. Prime editing has superior safety and precision of editing relative to other tools. CRISPR/Cas9 mediates double-stranded breaks that can lead to indel events and catastrophic chromothripsis. The NHEJ process favoured in non-dividing cells repairs the broken DNA ends in an unpredictable manner. HDR has a much more precise mode of action but is generally only effective ex vivo. HDR of autologous stem cells and subsequent differentiation into retinal progenitor cells is a possibility, however, the tumorigenic potential is a real concern, and retinal stem cell therapy has not proven to be a viable strategy to date. The safety of base editing is also dubious: new SNVs are frequently introduced, and bystander editing entails unpredictable genomic changes that limit the precision of this technique. Despite the clear advantages of prime editing from the perspectives of applicability and safety, the tool is hampered by its efficiency and delivery in vivo. CRISPR/Cas9 and base editors are both packageable within a single AAV vector, whereas prime editors are only packageable within dual vectors, which considerably lowers activity due to the recombination step following transfection. AAV is a relatively safe, FDA-approved vector that is readily available. Other delivery tools, such as electroporation, still require extensive optimisation for use in human patients, prompting the reconsideration of other CRISPR tools in favour of prime editing. Nonetheless, further research would still be required to improve the safety of CRISPR/Cas9 and base editing tools. Research efforts would perhaps be better directed towards creating more compact prime editing constructs or developing more robust delivery methods with greater capacity, with a focus on maximising the size of the treatment population. This would ultimately generate tools that are highly attractive to investors and maximise funding for research into rare diseases.",N/A,20 4 2023
Retinitis Pigmentosa Sine Pigmento in a Carrier of Usher Syndrome,"We report a carrier of Usher syndrome type I with retinitis pigmentosa sine pigmento. A 71-year-old male was referred for further evaluation of severe, progressive, painless vision loss in both eyes over the course of four years. He had bilateral sensorineural hearing loss. Upon a comprehensive examination, his best-corrected visual acuity was 20/100 in the right eye and 20/40 in the left eye. He had an unremarkable anterior segment examination and normal intraocular pressures in both eyes. Upon fundus examination, the patient had pale discs, optic disc cupping, and multiple scattered drusen in the macula and at the midperiphery of both eyes. Optical coherence tomography showed retinal nerve fiber layer thinning in all quadrants. The visual field was severely constricted in both eyes. A comprehensive workup for infectious and inflammatory causes, as well as a brain MRI, was unremarkable. Sequencing analysis showed that he carried a heterozygous pathogenic mutation, USH1C c.672C>A (p.Cys224*) variant. Usher syndrome is a rare genetic disease characterized by hearing loss and retinitis pigmentosa. Our case suggests that patients and carriers of Usher syndrome may have a phenotype compatible with retinitis pigmentosa sine pigmento.","Usher syndrome (USH) is a rare, autosomal recessive disorder characterized by progressive retinal dystrophy, sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL), and variable vestibular dysfunction [<xref rid=""REF1"" ref-type=""bibr"">1</xref>]. This syndrome is responsible for about half of all hereditary deaf-blindness cases [<xref rid=""REF2"" ref-type=""bibr"">2</xref>]. Similar to other autosomal recessive disorders, USH incidence increases with consanguinity [<xref rid=""REF1"" ref-type=""bibr"">1</xref>]. A common clinical manifestation of the disease in patients with retinitis pigmentosa (RP) is progressive vision loss resulting from the degeneration of retinal photoreceptors [<xref rid=""REF3"" ref-type=""bibr"">3</xref>]. Symptoms include nyctalopia, decreased visual acuity and contrast sensitivity, peripheral vision restriction, and end-stage central vision loss [<xref rid=""REF3"" ref-type=""bibr"">3</xref>,<xref rid=""REF4"" ref-type=""bibr"">4</xref>]. Upon fundus examination, there is optic disc atrophy, vessel attenuation, and mid-peripheral bony spicules [<xref rid=""REF3"" ref-type=""bibr"">3</xref>,<xref rid=""REF5"" ref-type=""bibr"">5</xref>]. Usher syndrome can be classified into three clinical types according to the severity and progression of SNHL and age at the onset of RP [<xref rid=""REF1"" ref-type=""bibr"">1</xref>]. Currently, there is no cure for this syndrome; however, a timely diagnosis and early intervention of Usher syndrome are essential for adequate rehabilitation of potential developmental interferences. Kwiecień and co-workers first reported a patient with Usher syndrome presenting as retinitis pigmentosa sine pigmento [<xref rid=""REF4"" ref-type=""bibr"">4</xref>]. Hereby, we report the phenotype of a carrier of Usher syndrome type I with an exon 8, c.672C>A (p.Cys224*) variant. A 71-year-old male patient had bilateral SNHL during adulthood and reported a four-year history of severe, progressive, painless, vision loss in his right eye (OD). His family history was remarkable for deafness in his mother, maternal uncle, and brother. Past medical and surgical history was remarkable for rheumatoid arthritis, hypertension, and pterygium surgery of the left eye (OS). Upon comprehensive ophthalmic examination, his best-corrected visual acuity was 20/100 OD and 20/40 OS with a manifest refraction of −0.50 +2.00 × 165 OD and -0.50 +1.25 × 010 OS. Intraocular pressure was 21 mmHg in both eyes (OU). He was unable to do the Ishihara color plates test. Extraocular movements were within normal limits, without nystagmus. Pupils were round and reactive to light, without any relative afferent defect. Anterior segment examination was unremarkable. Upon slit lamp examination, the patient had nuclear sclerosis 2+ of both lenses. Upon fundus examination, the patient had pale discs with optic disc cupping (C/D ratio of the OD: horizontal: 0.6, vertical: 0.7; C/D ratio of the OS: horizontal: 0.8, vertical: 0.7), and multiple small drusen in the periphery of the macula bilaterally (Figure <xref rid=""FIG1"" ref-type=""fig"">1</xref>). Retinal midperiphery had no pigment. Optical coherence tomography (OCT) of the disks showed moderate disk cupping OU with retinal nerve fiber layer thinning in all quadrants of the OD, and in the temporal, superior, and inferior quadrants of the OS, while the macular OCT revealed a significantly decreased cube average thickness and volume OU. There was no evidence of intraretinal cystic macular edema, macular thickening, or subretinal fluid OU. Electroretinogram (ERG) showed decreased amplitude in both scotopic and photopic phases. Upon visual field examination, the patient had ring scotomas OU with decreased mean deviation (-27.16 dB and -27.57 dB in the OD and OS, respectively) and increased pattern standard deviation results (7.14 dB and 6.51 dB in the OD and OS, respectively). Upon comprehensive systemic workup, there was no evidence of infectious, inflammatory, or other systemic diseases. Upon genetic analysis using an Invitae IRD panel (Invitae Corporation, San Francisco, CA), the patient had a heterozygous pathogenic mutation, c.672C>A (p.Cys224*) variant in the USH1C gene. Usher syndrome is an autosomal recessive syndromic ciliopathy that is clinically and genetically heterozygous [<xref rid=""REF1"" ref-type=""bibr"">1</xref>]. It is characterized by RP, SNHL, and in some cases, vestibular dysfunction. The most common and severe form of this syndrome is type I, also known as USH1, and is characterized by severe-to-profound SNHL, RP, and vestibular dysfunction with onset before puberty [<xref rid=""REF1"" ref-type=""bibr"">1</xref>]. Fundus examination, ERG, visual field, physical evaluation, and family history help guide the diagnosis of this disease; however, genetic testing is the most definitive diagnostic tool. To this day, there are six causative genes identified underlying Usher subtype 1, one of which is the USH1C [<xref rid=""REF1"" ref-type=""bibr"">1</xref>]. Our patient had a history of bilateral SNHL and severe, progressive, painless vision loss OD, as well as a family history of deafness. These characteristics did not deviate from those found in classic cases of Usher syndrome. The patient included in our study is classified as a carrier of an atypical form of RP, referred to by several authors as sine pigmento, because of the absence of peripheral bone-spicule-like pigmentation on the examination of the retina [<xref rid=""REF5"" ref-type=""bibr"">5</xref>,<xref rid=""REF6"" ref-type=""bibr"">6</xref>]. It is our impression that patients and carriers of Usher syndrome may present RP in the absence of peripheral bone-spicule-like pigmentation. The carrier status of our patient is a possible cause for his late onset of phenotypic presentation. Furthermore, our patient carries a heterozygous pathogenic mutation on the USH1C gene with an exon 8, c.672C>A (p.Cys224*) variant. This mutation creates a premature translational stop signal in the USH1C gene leading to the potential absence or disruption of protein function [<xref rid=""REF7"" ref-type=""bibr"">7</xref>]. The USH1 gene encodes harmonin, a protein required for the development and maintenance of mechanotransduction in cochlear hair cells; thus, making USH an inherited ciliopathy [<xref rid=""REF8"" ref-type=""bibr"">8</xref>]. Unlike most USH1 patients, our patient reported normal vestibular function in infancy and gradual development of SNHL in adulthood, which might be related to his carrier status. Identification of gene expression phenotypes in carriers of Usher syndrome is crucial to enhance and facilitate the study of carriers, who are more prevalent than those with the genetic disease. Using timely genetic analysis and diagnosis may grant patients with Usher syndrome the opportunity to identify offspring's risk of recurrence and receive early education, rehabilitation, counseling, and support. Further studies should be conducted to compare the phenotypic variability between control patients and carriers. Usher syndrome is a rare genetic disease characterized by hearing loss and the classical features of RP. However, our case suggests that patients and carriers of Usher syndrome may also have RP sine pigmento. Patients with early onset of SNHL and RP should be genetically tested to diagnose and provide comprehensive care accordingly in the early stages of child development.",N/A,17 4 2023
"Natural Disease Course in Usher Syndrome Patients Harboring <italic toggle=""yes"">USH2A</italic> Variant p.Cys870* in Exon 13, Amenable to Exon Skipping Therapy","The aim of the study was to determine the rate of retinal degeneration in patients with c.2610C>A (p.Cys870*) in <italic toggle=""yes"">USH2A</italic> exon 13, amenable to exon skipping therapy. There were nine patients from seven families, three of whom were male (two were homozygous). Seven patients had follow-up data (median of 11 years). Analysis included best corrected visual acuity (BCVA, decimal Snellen), visual field (Goldmann perimetry target II/4), fundus autofluorescence (FAF), optical coherence tomography (OCT), and microperimetry (MP). The median age at the onset of nyctalopia was 20 years (range, 8–35 years of age). At the first exam, at a median age of 42 years, the median BCVA was 0.5 (0.2–1.0), and the median visual field diameter was 23° (5°–114°). Imaging showed a hyperautofluorescent ring delineating preserved foveal photoreceptors in 78% (7/9) of patients, while 22% (2/9) had a hyperautofluorescent patch or atrophy, reflecting advanced disease. Survival analysis predicted that 50% of patients reach legal blindness based on a visual field diameter < 20° at the age of 52 (95% CI, 45–59) and legal blindness based on a BCVA ≤ 0. 1 (20/200) at the age of 55 (95% CI, 46–66). Visual field constriction occurred at the median rate of radial 1.5 deg/year, and hyperautofluorescent ring constriction occurred at the median rate of 34 μm/year. A non-null second allele was found in two patients: p.Thr4315Pro and p.Arg303His; the patient with p.Arg303His had a milder disease. The rates of progression will be useful in the design and execution of clinical trials.","Usher syndrome is an autosomal recessive genetic disease presenting with a combination of retinitis pigmentosa (RP) and varying degrees of hearing loss. Among the three major clinical subtypes, Usher syndrome type II is the most frequent, caused by pathogenic variants in <italic toggle=""yes"">USH2A</italic>, <italic toggle=""yes"">GPR98,</italic> and <italic toggle=""yes"">DFNB31,</italic> and is characterized by moderate to severe congenital hearing loss, the onset of RP in the second decade of life, and normal vestibular function [<xref rid=""B1-genes-14-00652"" ref-type=""bibr"">1</xref>,<xref rid=""B2-genes-14-00652"" ref-type=""bibr"">2</xref>]. Causative variations most frequently occur in the <italic toggle=""yes"">USH2A</italic> gene, which consists of 72 exons and encodes the structural protein Usherin, crucial for retinal photoreceptors and cochlear hair cells [<xref rid=""B3-genes-14-00652"" ref-type=""bibr"">3</xref>,<xref rid=""B4-genes-14-00652"" ref-type=""bibr"">4</xref>,<xref rid=""B5-genes-14-00652"" ref-type=""bibr"">5</xref>]. Impairment of Usherin results in early histopathological findings in the retina that include shortening of rod outer segments and cell death. These changes lead to problems with night vision, or nyctalopia. Later, cone cells are also damaged and slowly degenerate, causing central vision loss [<xref rid=""B3-genes-14-00652"" ref-type=""bibr"">3</xref>,<xref rid=""B6-genes-14-00652"" ref-type=""bibr"">6</xref>].

Nine Slovenian syndromic <italic toggle=""yes"">USH2A</italic> patients from seven families were included in our study (five females and four males). They all had a c.2610C>A (p.Cys870*) variant in exon 13 of the <italic toggle=""yes"">USH2A</italic> gene, two of which were homozygous and the other two were heterozygous. The majority of patients had been identified and genotyped in the scope of a multicentric study, Treatrush [<xref rid=""B11-genes-14-00652"" ref-type=""bibr"">11</xref>,<xref rid=""B23-genes-14-00652"" ref-type=""bibr"">23</xref>], and one relative was added subsequently (patient 9). Patient 4 has been included in a previous publication describing double hyperfluorescent rings in a subgroup of <italic toggle=""yes"">USH2A</italic> patients with preserved peripheral retina [<xref rid=""B10-genes-14-00652"" ref-type=""bibr"">10</xref>]. The median age at the first exam was 42 years (range, 25–56 years of age). Seven patients were followed longitudinally, with a median follow-up time of 11 years (range, 9–23 years of age). Disease onset was determined from medical history as the age when patients first noticed difficulties with night vision (nyctalopia). Visual acuity was measured with Snellen charts and converted to logMAR. Color vision was measured using Ishihara tables. Manual Goldmann perimetry (target II/4) was used to estimate the extent of the remaining central island of the visual field. The visual fields were scanned and measured using Image J (available at imagej.net). The remaining peripheral islands of the visual field (if present) were not included in this analysis to ensure better correspondence with the hyperautofluorescent ring measurement. For both, visual acuity and visual fields, Kaplan Meier survival analysis was performed to determine the age when 50% of patients reached legal blindness, based on the VA ≤ 0.1 (20/200) or VF diameter < 20° [<xref rid=""B12-genes-14-00652"" ref-type=""bibr"">12</xref>,<xref rid=""B18-genes-14-00652"" ref-type=""bibr"">18</xref>] in order to facilitate the comparison with other cohorts. Fundus autofluorescence imaging (FAF) and optical coherence tomography (OCT) were performed (Heidelberg, Spectralis) as previously described [<xref rid=""B11-genes-14-00652"" ref-type=""bibr"">11</xref>]. FAF patterns were then categorized into hyperautofluorescent rings, hyperautofluorescent patches and atrophy [<xref rid=""B11-genes-14-00652"" ref-type=""bibr"">11</xref>]. The accompanying software (Heidelberg, Spectralis) was used to measure the inner diameter of the hyperautofluorescenct ring. The presence of cystoid macular edema (CME) was determined based on OCT images. To analyze retinal function, static microperimetry was performed when possible, using Nidek MP1 (NAVIS software version 1.7.9, Nidek Technologies, Padova, Italy), after pupil dilatation with topical 1% tropiciamide. The sensitivity values from all 56 test loci and fixation were then superimposed over a 55° FAF image. Electrophysiology (ERG) data was reviewed if available. Five patients underwent full-field ERG, and three of them also underwent pattern ERG (PERG) with simultaneous visual evoked potentials (VEP), using the large field (30.7 × 23.6°) checkerboard. All recordings were performed according to the standards of the International Society of Clinical Electrophysiology of Vision (ISCEV) [<xref rid=""B24-genes-14-00652"" ref-type=""bibr"">24</xref>,<xref rid=""B25-genes-14-00652"" ref-type=""bibr"">25</xref>,<xref rid=""B26-genes-14-00652"" ref-type=""bibr"">26</xref>]. Yearly changes in visual acuity, visual field, and ring diameter, were calculated in patients with at least two measurements, by dividing the difference between the first and last exam with the number of follow-up years. The yearly loss was also calculated as a percentage of the initial value at the first exam. The disease was largely symmetrical between the eyes. The right eye was used for analysis except for Kaplan Meier, where the better-seeing eye was used to best represent the effect of disease on the patient. The study was approved by the Slovenian Ethics Committee for Research in Medicine (55/01/11, 139/01/11), and all research procedures have been carried out in accordance with The Code of Ethics of the World Medical Association (Declaration of Helsinki) for experiments involving humans. Informed consent for genetic analysis was obtained from all subjects. The study was supported by the Slovenian Research Agency (ARRS J3-1750). The study reports precise disease progression parameters relating to the <italic toggle=""yes"">USH2A</italic> variant p.Cys870*. The observations should be taken into account when planning clinical trials. We presume, that for p.Cys870* patients, successful treatment between the ages 40 and 50 would result in the most notable rescue of vision.",N/A,05 3 2023
"Efficacy, pharmacokinetics, and safety in the mouse and primate retina of dual AAV vectors for Usher syndrome type 1B","Gene therapy of Usher syndrome type 1B (USH1B) due to mutations in the large <italic toggle=""yes"">Myosin VIIA</italic> (<italic toggle=""yes"">MYO7A</italic>) gene is limited by the packaging capacity of adeno-associated viral (AAV) vectors. To overcome this, we have previously developed dual AAV8 vectors which encode human <italic toggle=""yes"">MYO7A</italic> (dual AAV8.<italic toggle=""yes"">MYO7A</italic>). Here we show that subretinal administration of 1.37E+9 to 1.37E+10 genome copies of a good-manufacturing-practice-like lot of dual AAV8.<italic toggle=""yes"">MYO7A</italic> improves the retinal defects of a mouse model of USH1B. The same lot was used in non-human primates at doses 1.6× and 4.3× the highest dose proposed for the clinical trial which was based on mouse efficacy data. Long-lasting alterations in retinal function and morphology were observed following subretinal administration of dual AAV8.<italic toggle=""yes"">MYO7A</italic> at the high dose. These findings were modest and improved over time in the low-dose group, as also observed in other studies involving the use of AAV8 in non-human primates and humans.

We have previously shown that subretinal delivery of dual hybrid AAV vectors, each carrying one-half of a large expression cassette up to 9 kb in size, efficiently transduce the retina of small and large animal models.<xref rid=""bib9"" ref-type=""bibr""><sup>9</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid=""bib10"" ref-type=""bibr""><sup>10</sup></xref> This occurs as a result of AAV DNA tail-to-head concatemerization mediated by both AAV inverted terminal repeats (ITRs) and/or recombination through highly recombinogenic sequences followed by their splicing from the reconstituted mature mRNA.<xref rid=""bib9"" ref-type=""bibr""><sup>9</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid=""bib10"" ref-type=""bibr""><sup>10</sup></xref> We developed dual hybrid AAV8 vectors (hereafter named dual AAVs) to treat retinitis pigmentosa (RP) associated with Usher syndrome type 1B (USH1B; MIM:#<ext-link ext-link-type=""omim"" http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink href=""276900"" id=""intref0010"">276900</ext-link>). USH1B is caused by biallelic mutations in the <italic toggle=""yes"">MYO7A</italic> gene which encodes the large unconventional Myosin VIIA (MYO7A) motor protein.<xref rid=""bib11"" ref-type=""bibr""><sup>11</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid=""bib12"" ref-type=""bibr""><sup>12</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid=""bib13"" ref-type=""bibr""><sup>13</sup></xref> USH1B patients are born with congenital hearing impairment or are completely deaf and have prepubertal onset of RP.<xref rid=""bib14"" ref-type=""bibr""><sup>14</sup></xref> While cochlear implants are available to counteract deafness, no treatment is currently available for RP. We have previously shown that subretinal administration of dual AAV serotype 8 (AAV8) encoding for <italic toggle=""yes"">MYO7A</italic> (dual AAV8.<italic toggle=""yes"">MYO7A</italic>) results in the reconstitution and expression of full-length human MYO7A in both mice and pigs<xref rid=""bib9"" ref-type=""bibr""><sup>9</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid=""bib10"" ref-type=""bibr""><sup>10</sup></xref> and improves the retinal defects of the shaker1 (sh1) mouse model of USH1B.<xref rid=""bib9"" ref-type=""bibr""><sup>9</sup></xref> Our aim is to translate retinal gene therapy with dual AAV8.<italic toggle=""yes"">MYO7A</italic> into patients with USH1B RP. In view of this, we performed a dose-response study in sh1 mice to select three doses of dual AAV8.<italic toggle=""yes"">MYO7A</italic> to be translated to USH1B subjects taking into account that the human retinal surface is around 100-fold larger than that of mice.<xref rid=""bib15"" ref-type=""bibr""><sup>15</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid=""bib16"" ref-type=""bibr""><sup>16</sup></xref> In view of a first-in-human trial of dual AAV vectors, we have performed safety, biodistribution, and expression studies in non-human primates (NHPs) which have a similar eye size and retinal structure as humans, including the presence of the macular region shared only among primates. Here, we demonstrate that subretinal administration of a good manufacturing practice (GMP)-like lot of dual AAV8.<italic toggle=""yes"">MYO7A</italic> improves USH1B retinal defects in mice and has a safety, biodistribution, and expression profile in NHPs that supports its use in humans.  In this work, we produced data required for the clinical translation of a gene therapy based on subretinal administration of dual hybrid AAV vectors serotype 8 encoding human <italic toggle=""yes"">Myosin VIIA</italic> (dual AAV8.<italic toggle=""yes"">MYO7A</italic>) to treat RP associated with USH1B. To the best of our knowledge, this represents the first report on the use of dual AAV vectors in the primate retina. The dual AAV8.<italic toggle=""yes"">MYO7A</italic> lot used in this work was produced according to a process that is similar to the GMP process employed for the clinical lot. The dose-response study in sh1<sup>−/−</sup> mice allowed selection of three dual AAV doses that induce dose-dependent MYO7A expression and improve melanosome localization in the RPE of the sh1 mouse model of USH1B. Since sh1 mice, like other rodent models of Usher syndrome, do not present with the progressive photoreceptor degeneration observed in humans,<xref rid=""bib26"" ref-type=""bibr""><sup>26</sup></xref> we need to rely on ultrastructural retinal abnormalities such as RPE melanosome mislocalization<xref rid=""bib9"" ref-type=""bibr""><sup>9</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid=""bib17"" ref-type=""bibr""><sup>17</sup></xref> to infer the biological impact of our therapeutic approach. While this is of course limiting in terms of prediction of the therapeutic effect in humans, we show that the three doses of dual AAV we administered subretinally in mice results in expression of MYO7A protein between 40% and 67% of that detected in heterozygous sh1<sup>+/−</sup> mice. Considering that the AAV transduced retinal area in mice is about 30% of the total retina, and that the western blot analysis is performed using a whole retinal lysate (which therefore includes about 70% of untransduced tissue), in the transduced area we likely achieve between 60% and 100% of the total MYO7A content of a wild-type mouse (assuming that heterozygous sh1<sup>+/−</sup> mice produce 50% of the levels of MYO7A of wild-type sh1<sup>+/+</sup> mice). If this holds true in humans, we are reconstituting levels of MYO7A expression expected to be therapeutically relevant even at the low and intermediate doses of dual AAV. The biodistribution study in NHPs shows that dual AAV vectors remain mostly localized to the retina and few other ocular tissues upon subretinal administration, while spreading to extraocular components of the visual pathway was negligible. Biodistribution to systemic tissues was minimal. Data suggest that vector spreading occurred through serum and the lymphatic system; no dual AAV DNA was found in gonads, which minimizes the risk of germline transmission. These results are in line with a previous study based on subretinal injection of similar AAV8 doses in NHPs.<xref rid=""bib22"" ref-type=""bibr""><sup>22</sup></xref> Similarly, MYO7A expression was mainly confined to the retina. In any case, ectopic expression of dual AAV8.<italic toggle=""yes"">MYO7A</italic> should not be worrisome considering the wide expression profile reported for MYO7A RNA (<ext-link ext-link-type=""uri"" http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink href=""https://www.proteinatlas.org"" id=""intref0015"">https://www.proteinatlas.org</ext-link>; <ext-link ext-link-type=""uri"" http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/"" id=""intref0020"">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/</ext-link> gene ID: 4647). Vector shedding in tears and serum was transient and similar in duration to what was previously reported in NHPs receiving similar doses of AAV8.<xref rid=""bib22"" ref-type=""bibr""><sup>22</sup></xref> Similarly, no AAV8 vector shedding in tears was demonstrated in subjects enrolled in a recent gene therapy clinical trial (<ext-link ext-link-type=""uri"" http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink href=""https://clinicaltrials.gov/"" id=""intref0025"">ClinicalTrials.gov</ext-link> identifier: <ext-link ext-link-type=""ClinicalTrials.gov"" http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink href=""NCT02610582"" id=""intref0030"">NCT02610582</ext-link><xref rid=""bib2"" ref-type=""bibr""><sup>2</sup></xref>). Overall, the dual AAV8.<italic toggle=""yes"">MYO7A</italic> pharmacokinetic profile appears safe. Dual AAV8.<italic toggle=""yes"">MYO7A</italic> subretinal administration to NHP resulted in AAV dose-dependent ocular structural and functional findings, which were mild at the ld and improved over time. The observed amelioration suggest that these alterations may be attributed to an inflammatory process, likely caused by AAV, as suggested by our immunology data and results of non-clinical studies using subretinal administration of similar AAV8 doses in NHPs.<xref rid=""bib27"" ref-type=""bibr""><sup>27</sup></xref> In that study from Reichel et al., a role for AAV8-induced inflammatory responses was suggested by the presence of mononuclear cell infiltrates (identified as CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells and CD20<sup>+</sup> B cells in the AAV8-injected areas), as well as hyper-reflective spots and reversible changes in the ellipsoid zone (EZ) signal in the OCT analysis. Importantly, the corresponding GMP lot of that vector was used in a clinical trial for achromatopsia (<ext-link ext-link-type=""uri"" http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink href=""https://clinicaltrials.gov/"" id=""intref0035"">ClinicalTrials.gov</ext-link> identifier: <ext-link ext-link-type=""ClinicalTrials.gov"" http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink href=""NCT02610582"" id=""intref0040"">NCT02610582</ext-link>) and showed a good safety profile in humans.<xref rid=""bib2"" ref-type=""bibr""><sup>2</sup></xref> Notably, EZ changes are typically observed in eye inflammatory diseases and seem to be associated with an alteration of refractive characteristics of photoreceptors rather than with their disruption;<xref rid=""bib28"" ref-type=""bibr""><sup>28</sup></xref> indeed, as inflammation resolves the EZ reappears, thus excluding a permanent loss of cells or their function. The EZ findings reported in the study from Reichel et al.<xref rid=""bib27"" ref-type=""bibr""><sup>27</sup></xref> resemble what we observed in the macula region of HD-treated eyes, where the EZ line reappears at week 13/14 compared with week 4/5, albeit improvement was partial. Also, the presence of persistent HRF in the bleb areas was reported in NHPs studies, based on subretinal injections of AAV8 at similar doses.<xref rid=""bib29"" ref-type=""bibr""><sup>29</sup></xref> Notably, HRF were described in three different retinal gene therapy trials and were easily managed with corticosteroids.<xref rid=""bib2"" ref-type=""bibr""><sup>2</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid=""bib6"" ref-type=""bibr""><sup>6</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid=""bib30"" ref-type=""bibr""><sup>30</sup></xref> Although our GLP study did not identify a no observed adverse event level (NOAEL), overall data suggest that the LD of dual AAV8.<italic toggle=""yes"">MYO7A</italic> is close to the NOAEL. Considering that the LD administered in NHPs corresponds to 1.6-times the highest dose of the clinical trial (based on the different retinal areas between the two species), we do not plan to change the doses proposed for the clinical trial and defined them on the basis of the dose-response study in sh1 mice. Importantly, the clinical trial is a dose-escalation study in which safety must be assessed before treatment of the next subject in each dose cohort and before dose escalation. Therefore, we believe that the clinical study design and the unmet medical need represented by USH1B RP result in a positive risk/benefit ratio and pave the way for the use in humans of dual AAV8.<italic toggle=""yes"">MYO7A</italic>.
