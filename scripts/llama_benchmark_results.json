One year after treatment, the patient survived without local recurrence or distant metastasis. This report describes a rare case of RCC metastasis in VHL disease and its treatment. Von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) syndrome is an inherited autosomal dominant disease with a prevalence of approximately 1 in 30,000 people. VHL is characterized by tumors occurring at multiple sites; these include renal cell carcinoma (RCC), pancreatic endocrine tumors, central neuroangioblastoma, and\nneoplasms. For this reason, this case report may be useful for reproductive medicine specialists in the management of male infertility.
